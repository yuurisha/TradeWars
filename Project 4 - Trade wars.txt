Project Title:
"Impact Analysis of the Recent US-China Tariffs on Global Trade and Economy"
Project Tasks:
1. Data Collection and Cleaning
o Research and collect relevant data on US-China trade relations, including historical tariff rates, trade volume, and product categories affected by the recent tariffs.
o Obtain economic data related to global trade and countries that have been indirectly affected by these tariffs.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
o Perform exploratory analysis to identify trends in the trade volume before and after the tariffs were implemented.
o Visualize the changes in the trade balance between the US and China, as well as with other countries.
o Explore the effects on specific industries or product categories (e.g., technology, agriculture).

3. Sentiment Analysis of News Articles
o Collect and analyze news articles, trade reports, and government publications to understand public sentiment regarding the tariffs.
o Apply sentiment analysis techniques to gauge the positive, negative, or neutral sentiments toward the tariffs from different sources.

4. Correlation Analysis
o Investigate any potential correlations between tariff changes and key economic indicators, such as GDP growth, inflation rates, stock market reactions, and employment rates in both the US and China.

5. Predictive Modeling
o Build a basic predictive model to estimate the future impact of the tariffs on trade flow between the US, China, and other key countries.
o Use machine learning techniques like regression models, decision trees, or time series analysis.

6. Visualization of Findings
o Create interactive visualizations that showcase the changes in trade patterns, the industries most affected, and economic shifts before and after the tariffs.
o Present findings in a clear and compelling manner using tools like Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Plotly.

7. Conclusion and Recommendations
o Summarize the overall impact of the tariffs on global trade and the US-China economic relationship.
o Provide actionable recommendations for businesses, policymakers, or future trade agreements.
