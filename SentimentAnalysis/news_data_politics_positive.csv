BE acredita ser possível travar minas de lítio e elogia populações,"""Temos de acreditar que é [possível], porque a população está contra e se une para travar estas explorações. A população deste concelho, como de muitos [outros], tem dado lições de resistência ao país, tem protegido este território como o Governo não foi capaz de fazer, como o Estado devia ter protegido e não protegeu, como os maiores partidos deviam ter protegido e não protegeram"", reiterou Mariana Mortágua no final de um encontro com a associação de defesa ambiental Montalegre Com Vida, a propósito da exploração de lítio neste concelho do distrito de Vila Real.
A líder bloquista afirmou ser ""importante relembrar em todas as eleições"" que uma região não pode ser ""esburacada"" contra a vontade das suas gentes, alertando para a urgência de ""proteger"" os recursos do interior.
""Portugal tem de compreender que se quer proteger o interior, tem mesmo de proteger os seus recursos naturais. Daqui nasce a água que muita gente bebe, daqui vem a agricultura, a carne, produtos que valorizam o território e valorizam Portugal. Querer destruir isto tudo em nome de minas de lítio que não sabemos, sequer, se têm lítio, que não deixam ficar nenhuma riqueza neste território, é um desrespeito profundo para com o país e nós temos este compromisso de travar as minas de lítio"", reforçou.
Questionada sobre as contrapartidas ou 'royalties' para as populações, Mariana Mortágua apenas identificou ""a propaganda"" como ""argumento económico"", afirmando que o país ""só tem a perder"" com as minas de lítio.
""Não há argumentos económicos, postos de trabalho não há, a não ser a propaganda. [...] Quem vive aqui só tem a perder, o país só tem a perder, haverá um ou dois que vão ganhar, certamente, que é por isso que [aqui estão], mas isso não quer dizer que o país tenha alguma coisa a ganhar com esta destruição em Trás-os-Montes e noutras zonas"", defendeu.
Na aldeia de Morgade, a coordenadora do BE afirmou ainda que os recursos endógenos e a riqueza natural destes concelhos classificados como Património Agrícola Mundial têm mais valor que qualquer exploração mineira.
""É preciso dizer a estas pessoas que vamos conseguir salvar a sua terra, os recursos naturais, a biodiversidade, salvar a água, salvar o que resta deste país e dos seus recursos que valem tanto economicamente. Tem mais valor económico o que aqui se produz, a paisagem que aqui temos, a água que aqui é gerada do que possíveis minas. Portanto, sim, é possível travar estes processos"", concluiu.
A mina do Romano, em Montalegre, obteve em setembro de 2023 uma DIA favorável condicionada por parte da APA, que impôs a alocação de 'royalties', medidas compensatórias para as populações locais e de minimização para o lobo-ibérico.
A Lusorecursos já disse que tenciona iniciar a exploração mineira em 2027 e que a refinaria deverá entrar em laboração no ano a seguir. A mina é contestada por populares, Câmara de Montalegre e associações ambientalistas.
No final de março, a Comissão Europeia incluiu os projetos de exploração de lítio em Boticas e Montalegre, ambos no distrito de Vila Real, no primeiro lote de projetos designados como estratégicos ao abrigo do Regulamento Europeu das Matérias-Primas Críticas.

Putin elogia Musk e o compara ao pai do programa espacial soviético,"Putin elogia Musk e o compara ao pai do programa espacial soviético
Declarações acontecem em um momento de aproximação entre a Rússia e os Estados Unidos
O presidente russo, Vladimir Putin, elogiou nesta quarta-feira (16) o bilionário norte-americano Elon Musk e o comparou ao lendário engenheiro de foguetes soviético Sergei Korolev.
Suas declarações acontecem em um momento de aproximação entre a Rússia e os Estados Unidos sob a administração do presidente Donald Trump, da qual Musk é uma figura-chave.
""Vocês sabem, há um homem — mora nos Estados Unidos — Musk, que se poderia dizer está entusiasmado com Marte"", disse Putin a estudantes durante uma visita à Universidade Bauman, um centro em Moscou especializado em ciência e engenharia.
""Esse é o tipo de pessoa que raramente aparece entre os seres humanos, movida por uma ideia específica. Embora hoje isso pareça inacreditável, esse tipo de ideia muitas vezes dá frutos com o tempo"", acrescentou.
O líder russo comparou Musk a Sergei Korolev (1907–1966), o pai do programa espacial soviético e herói nacional russo, que desenvolveu o primeiro satélite, o Sputnik, assim como a Vostok 1, que colocou em órbita o primeiro cosmonauta, Yuri Gagarin, em 1961. ""Assim como as ideias de Korolev, de nossos pioneiros, chegaram no tempo certo"", declarou Putin.
Elon Musk, o homem mais rico do mundo e o conselheiro mais influente de Trump, é o fundador da SpaceX, uma empresa americana que lança foguetes para a Nasa e é proprietária da rede de internet via satélite Starlink.
O bilionário tem criticado com frequência a Ucrânia, que enfrenta uma ofensiva russa há três anos.
No mês passado, Musk acusou o presidente ucraniano, Volodimir Zelensky, de querer uma ""guerra eterna"" e, em fevereiro, afirmou que Kiev havia ido ""longe demais"" no conflito.",2025-04-17T00:05:00.000+03:00,https://www.otempo.com.br/mundo/2025/4/16/putin-elogia-musk-e-o-compara-ao-pai-do-programa-espacial-sovietico,AFP,positive
Congreso aprueba tarifa única para impulsar la masificación del gas,"Saber más
Con 110 votos a favor, y por vía de insistencia, el Congreso de la República aprobó el proyecto de ley que establece medidas para impulsar la masificación del gas natural.
La medida se da en un contexto donde se tienen tarifas diferentes en regiones con la capital a causa de razones estructurales de oferta y demanda.
El texto aprobado establece un alcance de una serie de incentivos para clientes, en la práctica industriales, que consuman hasta 50 mil metros cúbicos por mes de gas natural. No obstante, la medida no decantaría en una reducción de las tarifas.
Cabe precisar que el Gobierno intentó impulsar un texto sustitutorio, que fue rechazado, para que el umbral se eleve a 900 mil metros cúbicos, esto fue saludado por el sector empresarial para dinamizar la inversión en la estructura para su traslado, de manera que pueda reducirse su tarifa.
El proyecto establece que busca impulsar el acceso de la población al gas natural a través de la ejecución de proyectos de masificación como infraestructura de almacenamiento de hidrocarburos y red de distribución de ductos de gas.
Además, se establecen mecanismos de compensación para priorizar su acceso descentralizado. Sin embargo, con esta exclusión de beneficios no se alentarían estas inversiones.
Dentro de los puntos claves de este dictamen están: impulsar redes de distribución por ductos, permitir la participación estatal si no hay postores privados, y la creación de una entidad para gestionar el almacenamiento de combustibles.",2025-04-17T00:18:00.000+03:00,https://elcomercio.pe/economia/peru/congreso-aprueba-tarifa-unica-para-impulsar-la-masificacion-del-gas-l-ultimas-noticia,Redacción El Comercio Perú,positive

　　“央企市值管理纳入负责人业绩考核实际上已经试行了2-3年，2024年开始进行整体推进，预计2025年将全部落地实施。”荣正集团创始人、董事长郑培敏表示，增持、回购是典型的市值管理工具，央企通过增持、回购等手段维护市场稳定，推动市场重新评估央企的投资价值。
　　中国企业改革研究会研究员周丽莎认为，央企的增持、回购行为向市场传递了积极信号，有助于稳定市场情绪，增强投资者信心，吸引更多资金流入市场。
　　 招商证券 分析师林喜鹏认为，近期央企就稳定市场及时发声并付诸行动，不仅反映了市值管理纳入央企负责人考核等机制有效提高央国企的市值管理动力，也意味着部分央企已就市值管理建立了较高效的流程管理与响应机制。
　　 一省一策激活资本新动能
　　近日，多地国资发声维护资本市场平稳运行，一些地方国资以“一省一策”的方式开辟市值管理新实践。
　　安徽省国资委、安徽证监局联合印发的《关于加强省属企业控股上市公司市值管理若干事项的通知》提出，在并购重组方面，鼓励聚焦提高科技创新能力实施并购重组，打造一批科技领军企业；在稳定投资者回报预期方面，鼓励优先考虑现金分红，增加现金分红频次，增强投资者获得感；在增强投资者信心方面，建立常态化股票回购增持机制，鼓励用好用足股票回购增持再贷款工具。
　　上海市国资委印发的《关于加强上海市国有控股上市公司市值管理工作的若干意见》，提出从并购重组、股票回购增持、投资者回报、激励约束机制、信息披露、投资者关系管理等六方面，支持监管企业和上市公司用好各类市值管理政策和工具。
　　山东省国资委与山东证监局签署的《关于推动山东辖区国有控股上市公司高质量发展合作备忘录》提出，省属企业要以市值管理为抓手，综合运用增持、回购，加大分红频次与力度，规范信息披露，加强投资者关系管理等方式，持续维护好资本市场形象。
　　 招商证券 数据显示，近一周地方国企的拟增持、回购规模合计超200亿元，约占同期市场的23%。国资央企、地方国企上市公司近一周拟增持、回购规模合计达到全市场的55%。
　　郑培敏表示，各地国资以政策引导为核心，结合工具创新和合规要求，推动上市公司从“重融资”转向“回报投资者”，大力提升市场稳定性与信心，有助于市场对国企估值体系重新评估，促进资本市场高质量发展。

"新场景新产品新服务 消费主引擎增添""新""动力 _ 东方财富网","一季度中国经济“成绩单”出炉，经济运行起步平稳开局良好，高质量发展呈现向新向好的蓬勃态势。本报今起推出“首季中国经济观察”系列报道，通过多维视角，探寻中国经济在稳增长、促转型、增动能中展现出的韧性与活力。
　　 线上线下 ，家电、数码产品销售喜报频传，车市月度增速刷新近十年纪录；多地景区，外骨骼 机器人 开启试用，“赛博爬山”解锁文旅消费新体验；消博会上，智能 机器人 、 智能家居 、 智能穿戴 产品等众多智能产品闪耀亮相，加快从实验室走入“百姓家”……
　　一季度，我国大宗消费增势稳健，部分商品表现超出预期；服务消费方兴未艾，增长速度超过商品消费；新型消费蓬勃发展，前沿科技赋能消费场景创新。
　　专家表示，消费是拉动经济增长的主引擎。提振消费具有重要现实作用和长远意义。当前，政策持续发力，“以旧换新”加力扩围、扩大服务消费等举措加快落地显效；科技赋能推动智能产品、服务场景创新扩容；服务消费占比提升，文体旅融合深化，成为增长新动能。未来需进一步优化收入分配、完善社会保障，以消费升级夯实经济高质量发展根基。
　　 “新”意渐浓
　　 商品消费提质向好
　　打开 京东 App，补贴专区格外醒目，国家补贴、平台补贴等各式优惠一目了然，“出口转内销”会场好物琳琅满目。走进西单 大悦城 ，草莓熊、史迪奇的公仔在52TOYS“莓好奇遇”快闪店的全国首站中分外吸睛，为这家已运营18年的商场引来更多客流。
　　消费向好的态势不止在“眼”前，也在“数”里行间。国家统计局16日公布，一季度，社会消费品零售总额增长4.6%，增速逐月回升。其中，3月消费增速达5.9%，创13个月新高。
　　商品消费在我国消费中占大头。“以旧换新”政策加力扩围、消费金融组合出招、地方政府连环施策……
　　2025年以来，政策创新蔚然成风，聚焦提振消费接续用力、更加给力。
　　汽车作为传统大宗消费品，是推动消费增长的重要力量。中汽协数据显示，一季度，我国汽车产销量分别为756.1万辆和747万辆，同比分别增长14.5%和11.2%。3月，乘用车销量246.8万辆，同比增长10.4%，增速为近十年同期最高。中汽协副秘书长陈士华分析，一系列提振汽车消费政策措施得以延续并加速落地，推动汽车产销呈现两位数增长，实现良好开局，相关政策组合效应将持续释放，有助于延续市场增长态势。
　　IP经济、 首发经济 为传统商圈增添品牌力与吸引力。“西单 大悦城 今年已推出三个全国级首发首展。接下来，我们将继续接洽高品质的首发资源。”西单 大悦城 相关工作人员告诉中国 证券 报记者。
　　第五届消博会首设新消费科技展区，智能 机器人 、全屋 智能家居 、 智能穿戴 产品等智能产品集中亮相；4月19日，全球首个 人形机器人 半程马拉松将在北京亦庄开跑；近期， 优必选 与 居然智家 签订战略合作协议，拟推动智能养老机器人在家庭服务环境及相关养老服务场景的应用……从展台、赛道到家庭，智能消费正加速融入日常生活。
　　“促进 人工智能 消费终端进千家万户， 人工智能 商业终端进千商万店， 人工智能 技术赋能消费场景创新。”商务部市场运行和消费促进司司长李刚说。
　　 方兴未艾
　　 服务消费加快发展
　　科技与政策的共同驱动下，商品消费焕新升级、展现活力，服务消费也加快发展、释放潜能，成为消费扩容升级的重要抓手。
　　中国旅游研究院研究员韩元军表示，一季度，在春节假期、冰雪季等因素助推下，我国文旅市场进入繁荣发展新周期。游客出行意愿、旅游市场整体规模、以上市公司为代表的企业营收等多维度指标均达到历年的新高度。“供给侧创新，是驱动文旅消费快速增长的重要因素之一。”韩元军说。
　　高科技产品服务与景区特色“一拍即合”，解锁更多消费新场景，驱动文旅消费进一步升级。“近年来，公司抢抓人工智能发展浪潮，研发打造黄山AI旅行助手，并在今年2月全面接入DeepSeek大模型，推动其在智能交互、场景服务、伴游体验等方面的全面升级。” 黄山旅游 相关负责人告诉记者。
　　随着“健康中国”战略深入实施，体育经济发展势头正酣，“体育+文旅”也成为消费市场的重要增长点。
　　“体育消费作为 体育产业 的内驱力，在促进经济增长、扩大内需等方面的作用日益凸显。”北京师范大学体育与运动学院副院长王兆红表示，一方面，体育消费直接带动体育用品制造、赛事运营、体育健身服务、体育旅游、体育培训等体育相关产业发展；另一方面，体育消费能够突破行业界限，衍生出“体育+文旅”“体育+康养”等产业协同联动的经济新业态，展现显著的乘数效应和区域经济带动作用。
　　文旅出行、体育健康、住宿餐饮、养老育幼……从更大范围看，服务消费正多点开花。
　　“从历史经验来看，服务业发展对提振消费意义重大。从需求端促进服务消费，从供给端支持服务业，可能是接下来经济政策的重要发力方向。” 京东 集团首席经济学家沈建光说。
　　服务消费将迎来更多政策支持。商务部部长王文涛表示，将多措并举扩大服务消费，加快政策推出，出台支持家政服务消费、发展数字消费等政策文件，会同相关部门制定促进旅游业、超高清、体育赛事经济、中医药健康发展等支持政策。
　　 促进增收
　　 夯实消费增长之基
　　外部环境变化，使扩大内需的必要性、提高居民消费能力和水平的必要性进一步上升。
　　消费是收入的函数，要提振消费，需促进消费能力提升。“在其他因素不变的情况下，居民收入增长越快、居民财富增长越快、居民对未来的预期越乐观，居民消费增长越快。”中国社会科学院金融研究所副所长、国家金融与发展实验室副主任张明说。
　　在中国人民大学中国就业研究所研究员毛宇飞看来，当居民收入提高后，可支配收入增多，直接提升了购买力。同时，稳定的收入增长也带来了稳定的租金、利息等财产性收入增加，会提升居民的预期、增强消费信心，促使他们敢于消费，进而对当期和未来消费支出带来积极影响。
　　张明建议，从收入维度提振居民消费，应通过财政补贴的方式增加中低收入家庭短期收入，大力促进民营企业的发展以进一步解决就业问题。同时，在国民收入跨部门分配方面，应显著提高居民部门收入所占份额；在居民部门内部，应逐渐实施更具力度的收入再分配政策，以增加中低收入群体收入占比。
　　从改善预期的角度看，毛宇飞建议，一方面要稳定预期，通过积极完善医疗、养老、失业等社会保障制度，减轻居民对未来不确定性的担忧；另一方面，要提高人力资本，这不仅可以提高劳动力素质，增加收入水平和生产效率，还能进一步改善消费结构、促进消费升级。
　　“为了同时促进短期经济复苏与中长期经济增长，应该更加鼓励有助于培育人力资本的消费。”张明说。
　　消费是驱动经济增长的引擎，超大规模国内市场构成抵御外部冲击的底气。可以期待，当政策工具箱精准激活要素潜能，当数字技术深度重构消费生态，当民生改善持续夯实消费基底，消费引擎将持续驱动中国经济巨轮劈波斩浪、勇毅前行。

Türkiye-Sudan relations: Education as a diplomatic bridge,"A key trait of modern diplomacy is its adaptability to emerging threats and crises, allowing the effective use of diverse tools, education being a vital one. Education shapes bilateral ties both scientifically and socially, and serves as a catalyst for diplomacy. Canadian analyst Daryl Copeland, in ""The SAGE Handbook of Diplomacy (2016),"" defines the science of diplomacy as using scientific cooperation to enhance international relations, a view that mirrors Türkiye’s recent educational diplomacy, notably in war-torn Sudan. Therefore, a brief look at Türkiye-Sudan relations is relevant.
Historically dating back to the 16th-century Ottoman Empire, the foundations of modern bilateral relations between Türkiye and Sudan were laid in the mid-20th century. In 1957, shortly after Sudan gained its independence, Türkiye opened an embassy in Khartoum. A significant milestone followed in 1981, when Sudan established a permanent diplomatic mission in Türkiye. Today, Sudan remains a key component of Türkiye’s Africa policy. The two countries cooperate in various sectors, including politics, military affairs, economy, health, agriculture and education. An important and often overlooked detail is the cultural affinity between the two peoples, highlighted by enduring friendship and abundant shared vocabulary between the Turkish and Arabic languages.
Sudan’s most pressing challenge today is the ongoing civil war, which began exactly two years ago on April 15, 2023. Throughout this period, Türkiye has supported Sudan both militarily and politically in efforts to restore stability, further reinforcing Ankara’s presence as a regional power. Over April 2023-2025, Sudanese Sovereignty Council President Abdulfettah al-Burhan visited Ankara four times, the most recent visit occurring last week as part of the Antalya Diplomacy Forum (ADF). On April 12, 2025, President Burhan also met with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, where key topics such as Türkiye’s support for Sudan’s territorial integrity, as well as its military and humanitarian aid commitments, were brought to the fore.
The foreign, energy and natural resources, and national defense ministers of both countries attended the delegation meetings. In this context, as emphasized by the Sudanese Foreign Minister, education diplomacy constitutes a vital dimension of Türkiye-Sudan relations, shaped by the shared vision of “establishing strong ties based on strategic foresight.” One of the key institutional actors in this area is Türkiye’s Council of Higher Education (YÖK).
Education constitutes an important dimension of Türkiye-Sudan relations. One of the most comprehensive cooperation agreements between the two countries in this field was signed in 2018 at the ministerial level, and establishing a Turkish-Sudanese University was placed on the agenda. Although both countries demonstrated a clear will to realize this initiative, the global pandemic and subsequent developments delayed its implementation. Nevertheless, educational cooperation between the two countries has continued despite challenging circumstances.
In the aftermath of the civil war that broke out in Sudan in April 2023, as “Compassionate Power,” one of the most prominent reflections of Ankara’s foreign policy has been its commitment to helping Sudan emerge from the crisis with minimal damage, by leveraging the restorative power of education. In this context, the Ministry of National Education and the YÖK have emerged as the leading actors in Türkiye’s educational diplomacy toward Sudan. Ankara carries out one pillar of this policy through the Ministry of National Education’s Maarif Schools, while YÖK continues its active engagement in higher education cooperation.
It is also worth noting that the constructive role played by the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs has catalyzed the recovery process. In fact, at the onset of the civil war, a “Turkish Universities Promotion Fair” was organized in Sudan from March 5-12, with the support of the Turkish Embassy in Khartoum, coordinated by the Education Counsellor’s Office, and in collaboration with the Sudanese Ministry of Education, the Sudanese Ministry of Higher Education, and Al-Neelen University. Various Turkish universities, including İnönü University, participated in the fair.
One of the significant efforts of the YÖK in this context is the implementation of an exemplary initiative in higher education, especially in light of the ongoing civil war. This initiative enables Al Neelen, Al Butana and Bahri Universities – affected by the conflict in Sudan – to continue their academic activities in Türkiye as “Guest Universities.” It is a concrete example of Türkiye’s continued role as a moral compass in global higher education.
As part of this initiative, the three universities mentioned will carry on their academic activities within Turkish institutions: İnönü University, Niğde Ömer Halisdemir University and Selçuk University, respectively. This gesture, which has been highly appreciated by both Sudanese higher education institutions and the Sudanese public, reflects YÖK’s extraordinary commitment and humanitarian vision.
Highlighting the significance of this initiative, YÖK President Erol Özvar stated that “Türkiye has always welcomed scholars who, for various reasons, were unable to pursue their academic work in their home countries.” He emphasized that “this project sets an example not only within the Islamic world but also for international academic collaboration.” Among the various partnerships established through this initiative, the cooperation between Al Neelen University and İnönü University deserves special attention.
The cooperation between Al Neelen and Inönü Universities constitutes a key pillar of the “Guest University” initiative coordinated by the YÖK. In fact, the visit of the delegation led by professor Elhadi Adam Mohamed Ibrahim (Rector of Al Neelen University and President of the Sudanese Universities Association) to Inönü University, which began last week, laid the groundwork for significant bilateral cooperation.
During the visit, hosted by professor Nusret Akpolat, Rector of Inönü University, a Memorandum of Understanding was signed between the two institutions. One of the main objectives of the Sudanese delegation is to transfer the knowledge and experience gained at the Faculty of Engineering, Department of Mining, to their home institutions in Sudan. Additionally, the delegation, headed by Elhadi, requested research and analytical support from Inönü University regarding an unusual mass cancer case observed in their country.
President of the YÖK, Özvar, along with several members of the council, met with a delegation led by Elhadi, president of the Sudanese Universities Union. The meeting focused on enhancing cooperation between Turkish and Sudanese universities, as well as scholarship opportunities for Sudanese academics to pursue postgraduate studies in Türkiye. The meeting was recognized as a significant milestone in Türkiye-Sudan educational relations, with both delegations affirming their potential to strengthen bilateral ties further. This development, which highlights the role of education as a bridge for maintaining diplomatic relations, is expected to make positive contributions to the future of Türkiye-Sudan relations.",2025-04-17T00:05:00.000+03:00,https://www.dailysabah.com/opinion/op-ed/turkiye-sudan-relations-education-as-a-diplomatic-bridge,Ahmet Turan,positive
Why Lockheed Martin Stock Soared While the Market Sagged Today,"An analyst's bullish new note on Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT) and the wider U.S. defense sector provided lift to the company's stock on an otherwise bearish Wednesday trading session. Lockheed Martin's shares closed the day almost 2% higher in price, providing quite the contrast to the tumbling S&P 500's (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) 2.2% decline.
The analyst in question was Kristine Liwag of veteran white-shoe investment bank Morgan Stanley. Well before market open that day, Liwag changed her Lockheed Martin recommendation to overweight (i.e., buy) from equal weight (hold). In doing so, she added $50 per share to his price target on the storied defense stock, to $575 per share.
Where to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Learn More »
The pundit's new take on the company was part of a broader Morgan Stanley update on defense industry stocks. According to reports, the investment bank rates the entire sector as ""attractive,"" as opposed to its formerly cautious view that it'll be an in-line performer. The company sees the U.S. defense budget being set at $1 trillion this year, amid growing international exports of combat goods, as a positive for these stocks.
While Morgan Stanley's top pick in the sector wasn't Lockheed Martin -- that honor went to longtime rival Northrop Grumman, due to better alignment with current U.S. defense priorities -- Liwag still felt Lockheed Martin was worthy of an upgrade. She particularly highlighted its robust and active foreign sales activities as potential motors of future growth.
This is indeed a fertile time for the global defense industry, with the grinding war in Ukraine, intense clashes in the Middle East, and rising geopolitical tensions elsewhere. Liwag is spot-on with her view that major defense exporters are in an excellent position just now, and Lockheed Martin is a primary example of such a company.

Djuro Macut asumió como primer ministro de Serbia - Infobae,"El primer ministro de Serbia, Djuro Macut, sonriendo después de la ceremonia de juramentación en el Parlamento de Belgrado, Serbia, 16 de abril de 2025. (REUTERS/Djordje Kojadinovic) Djuro Macut , un endocrinólogo y profesor universitario de 62 años, asumió el cargo de primer ministro de Serbia en un contexto político tenso , marcado por casi seis meses de protestas antigubernamentales en todo el país. Macut, prácticamente desconocido al público , se enfrenta a una de las mayores crisis de poder que ha vivido el gobierno serbio desde 2012, cuando el presidente Aleksandar Vučić y su partido, el Partido Progresista Serbio (SNS) , tomaron el control de la política nacional.
El nuevo primer ministro fue elegido para liderar el ejecutivo tras la renuncia de su predecesor. Es experto en el síndrome de ovario poliquístico y fue impulsado al ámbito político en enero de 2025, cuando participó en un mitin de apoyo a Vučić.
Durante ese evento, Macut destacó su experiencia académica y médica, subrayando que como profesor universitario instruyó a una veintena de promociones de estudiantes, que hoy son médicos reconocidos. Fue profesor de la Facultad de Medicina de la Universidad de Belgrado y vice director de la Clínica de Endocrinología, Diabetes y Enfermedades Metabólicas del Centro Clínico Universitario . También es miembro del Comité Ejecutivo de la Sociedad Europea de Endocrinología y profesor visitante en las universidades de Atenas y Skopie .
El presidente de Serbia, Aleksandar Vučić, asiste a la ceremonia de juramentación del primer ministro Djuro Macut y los miembros de su gabinete en el Parlamento de Belgrado, Serbia, 16 de abril de 2025. (REUTERS/Djordje Kojadinovic) El nombramiento de Macut se produce en medio de una crisis política en Serbia , con protestas encabezadas mayormente por estudiantes , que desde noviembre del año pasado exigen el restablecimiento del Estado de Derecho . Las manifestaciones surgieron después de la tragedia ocurrida en la estación de tren de Novi Sad , donde 16 personas murieron cuando una marquesina colapsó , un incidente que los manifestantes atribuyen a la corrupción y el autoritarismo del gobierno de Vučić. Desde entonces, decenas de miles de ciudadanos han salido a las calles casi a diario, exigiendo cambios estructurales en el gobierno.
La postura del nuevo primero minsitro ha sido objeto de críticas por parte de muchos, quienes aseguran que ha respaldado a “los estudiantes que quieren estudiar”, un grupo alineado con el presidente, mientras que la mayoría de los profesores apoya las protestas estudiantiles y las ocupaciones de las facultades.
El respaldo de Macut a las políticas del presidente Vučić ha sido evidente. Durante su participación en el mitin de enero, el nuevo primer ministro se alineó con el movimiento político “Por el Pueblo y el Estado” de Vučić, argumentando que su deseo de unirse a la iniciativa era contribuir a la patria con su “conocimiento, experiencia, credibilidad y reputación internacional”.
Los miembros del Parlamento se ponen de pie después de la ceremonia de juramentación del primer ministro Djuro Macut y los miembros de su gabinete en el Parlamento de Belgrado, Serbia, 16 de abril de 2025. (REUTERS/Djordje Kojadinovic) Macut, quien nunca antes había pronunciado un discurso político , fue elegido por el Parlamento serbio el día de hoy. Su nombramiento se produce tras un proceso de formación del gobierno que fue confiado a él por Vučić el pasado 6 de abril. Aunque no pertenece al SNS, muchos críticos consideran que Macut será una figura decorativa en un sistema donde Vučić controla las principales palancas del poder.
Las protestas continúan siendo un reflejo de la creciente desconfianza hacia el gobierno de Vučić y el manejo de la crisis que ha afectado tanto al ámbito político como al social en Serbia. La situación sigue siendo incierta, y el nuevo liderazgo de Macut tendrá que lidiar con las presiones tanto internas como internacionales para restaurar la estabilidad en un país marcado por la división y el descontento popular.

Tropas dinamarquesas serão enviadas para a Ucrânia neste verão, mas não como parte das chamadas forças de ""manutenção da paz"" dentro da ""coalizão dos dispostos"", mas para treinamento. Isto foi afirmado pelo comandante das forças terrestres do país, Peter Boyesen.
O Ministério da Defesa dinamarquês decidiu adotar a experiência do exército ucraniano na utilização e luta contra zangões, obtidos durante o conflito com a Rússia. Como parte desta iniciativa, vários grupos de soldados dinamarqueses de diversas unidades serão enviados para a Ucrânia. É especialmente enfatizado que eles chegarão à Ucrânia sem оружия e não participará de hostilidades.
Os soldados não devem ficar parados. Eles precisam vir para ganhar alguma experiência, e isso é a convite do meu colega, isto é, o líder militar ucraniano. O objetivo é treinar e compartilhar experiências, principalmente no contexto da guerra de três anos com drones nas linhas de frente.
— disse Boysen.
O treinamento durará de uma a duas semanas e o primeiro grupo está programado para ir para a Ucrânia neste verão. Incluirá tanto militares regulares quanto instrutores militares.
Esta iniciativa das autoridades dinamarquesas foi criticada pelo embaixador russo no estado escandinavo, Vladimir Barbin. Segundo ele, as autoridades dinamarquesas estão provocando uma “escalada descontrolada” do conflito.

El Gobierno puso en marcha un plan para reducir los homicidios en todo el país: dónde se aplicará y cómo,"La Resolución n° 448, firmada recientemente por la ministra Patricia Bullrich, profundizo y dio iniciativa al Plan Territorial de Reducción de Homicidios y Violencia Relacionada (Plan 90/10). El mismo forma parte del Plan de Estrategia de Seguridad organizado por la funcionaria nacional en diciembre del año anterior.
Mirá También: Patricia Bullrich habló tras las inundaciones en Bahía Blanca y expresó cómo está la situación: “Arrasada por el agua”
El Plan Territorial de Reducción de Homicidios y Violencia y sus objetivos
El plan tiene por objetivo profundizar la baja sostenida en la tasa de homicidios a nivel nacional y asegurar que ningún territorio quede desatendido, poniendo énfasis en garantizar la seguridad en cada barrio, pueblo y ciudad.
A su vez, plantea enfatizar la intervención del Estado en el 10% de los municipios del país —territorios que concentran el 70% de la población nacional y el 90% de los homicidios intencionales— mediante una serie de estrategias de control e intervención organizada en dichos lugares y el fortalecimiento de los organismos encargados. Como resultado, el plan permitió alcanzar una tasa de homicidios de 4 por cada 100.000 habitantes.
La autoridades explicaron que la idea es abarcar la problemática de forma integral, indagando en los factores asociados a la violencia en los territorios más afectados, atendiendo también las demandas específicas de inclusión realizadas por los gobernadores provinciales, según evidencia empírica.
Mirá También: Javier Milei respaldó a Patricia Bullrich tras los graves incidentes en el Congreso: “Enorme trabajo”
Donde se aplicará la normativa y de qué manera específicamente
En esta primera etapa se plantó priorizar las jurisdicciones de:
- La ciudad de Rosario, Santa Fe.
- San Miguel de Tucumán.
- Los partidos bonaerenses de Esteban Echeverría y General Pueyrredón.
- Los departamentos de Godoy Cruz y Las Heras, Mendoza.
- La ciudad de Córdoba.
Estos crímenes se asocian a otras formas de violencia, como la intrafamiliar y la juvenil. “Estas violencias, a su vez, retroalimentan un ciclo que aumenta la probabilidad de incidentes letales, por lo que es fundamental abordar estas dinámicas para tener un impacto sostenible en la reducción de homicidios”, señala la norma resolutiva. Esta propone por último reducir los factores de riesgo, desarrollar políticas de prevención y fortalecer los vínculos de confianza entre las comunidades y las fuerzas de seguridad federales.
Los datos demuestran que la tasa de homicidios en Argentina bajó en 2024 a 3,8 por cada 100 mil habitantes, el nivel más bajo desde el 2000, según datos preliminares del SNIC. Rosario, antes foco de violencia narco, mostró la mayor reducción. En total se registraron 1.810 homicidios dolosos, un 11,5% menos que en 2023.

Destaca Claudia Sheinbaum la importancia de salir a votar el 1 de junio en la elección del Poder Judicial,"Ciudad de México.- La presidenta Claudia Sheinbaum Pardo destacó la importancia de que todas y todos los mexicanos participen en la elección del próximo 1° de junio para elegir a sus juezas, jueces, magistradas, magistrados, ministras y ministros de la Suprema Corte de Justicia de la Nación (SCJN), ya que es la única manera de sanear al Poder Judicial y con ello se demuestra que México es el país más democrático del mundo.
“Es una elección histórica, es la primera vez que en México se va a elegir al Poder Judicial y también es un ejemplo al mundo. Pero el que el pueblo decida quiénes van a ser sus jueces es algo que así, a este nivel de participación y de apertura, creo que no hay ningún lugar en el mundo. Entonces, es un parteaguas en la historia de México y un ejemplo al mundo de que México es el país más democrático de todos, por una razón: porque en México quien decide es el pueblo. Entonces es muy importante que todos participemos, todos, sin excepción, todos y todas salgamos a votar el 1º de junio”, destacó en la conferencia matutina: “La mañanera del pueblo”.
Aseguró que el hecho de que el pueblo sea quien elija a sus jueces convierte la elección en histórica, ya que democratiza un proceso en el que antes de la reforma al Poder Judicial proponía la Presidencia y el Senado de la República decidía.
“Es la única manera de sanear al Poder Judicial, que la gente decida, es muy importante la participación y que se haya permitido que nosotros difundamos el 1 de junio. Que a nadie se le olvide, el 1° de junio es el día de la elección al poder judicial, es muy importante que todos participemos”, agregó.
La secretaria de gobernación, Rosa Icela Rodríguez Velázquez, recordó que el Tribunal Electoral del Poder Judicial de la Federación (TEPJF) , modificó el acuerdo emitido por el Consejo General del Instituto Nacional Electoral (INE), por el que se aprobaron los criterios que garantizan la equidad e imparcialidad en el desarrollo de las campañas y veda electoral para el proceso electoral extraordinario del Poder Judicial de la Federación, ya que concluyó que indebidamente el INE determinó ser la única autoridad con atribuciones exclusivas para la promoción del voto y de la participación ciudadana, ya que dichas restricciones no están previstas expresamente en la Ley y son contrarias a la Constitución.
Por ello, la Sala Superior del TEPJF, decidió que pueden promover el voto los Poderes de la Unión: Ejecutivo, Legislativo y Judicial federales; los Poderes Estatales exclusivamente para elecciones judiciales en sus entidades; los Organismos Públicos Locales Electorales (OPLE) y personas servidoras públicas.
En este sentido, puntualizó que está permitido promover el voto y participación ciudadana sin aludir a ninguna candidatura en específico; las campañas de comunicación social sin sesgo o apoyo a determinada candidatura; las campañas de orientación didácticas o educativas para informar la forma en que se podrá emitir el voto para cada uno de los cargos; y la comunicación social de carácter institucional que cumpla con fines informativos, educativos y de orientación social sobre el proceso.
En tanto que no está permitido: incluir imágenes, nombres o símbolos que identifiquen a funcionarios y candidatos en propaganda para promover la elección judicial; el gobierno federal no puede promover las elecciones locales, las autoridades locales no pueden promover la elección federal; usar logos o colores institucionales (las únicas autoridades que pueden mostrar sus logos son el INE y los OPLE) ; los candidatos en funciones no pueden participar en la propaganda institucional; e influir en la equidad de la contienda.
Detalló que las reglas específicas del proceso electoral extraordinario del Poder Judicial de la Federación establecen que la promoción que haga la autoridad debe ser genérica, sin mencionar partidos o candidatos; se pueden usar recursos públicos para promover la elección judicial, siempre que estén destinados a la comunicación social y cuando la propaganda tenga carácter institucional y fines informativos sin vulnerar los principios de neutralidad e imparcialidad; los spots o publicidad en internet no deben identificar al órgano que los emite; en ningún momento se deberán mostrar logos, slogan, imágenes de las personas candidatas o cualquier referencia que las pueda hacer identificables; los promocionales deberán incluir, en todos los casos, un cintillo que señale expresamente que los fines son informativos y educativos.
https://www.zocalo.com.mx/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DETECTOR-16-ABRIL.mp4 Explicó que el 1° de junio, las mexicanas y mexicanos recibirán a su llegada a la casilla seis boletas para la elección federal identificables por colores: morada para ministras y ministros; azul para magistraturas de Sala Superior del Tribunal Electoral; turquesa de magistraturas del Tribunal de Disciplina Judicial; salmón para magistraturas de las Salas Regionales del Tribunal Electoral; rosa para magistraturas de Circuito y amarilla de juzgados de Distrito. Adicionalmente, en 19 estados de la República se elegirán a juzgadores locales.
Explicó que en las boletas se podrán identificar en la parte superior el cargo por el que se votará y en la parte inferior el listado de candidaturas ordenado alfabéticamente y dividido por género (izquierdo, mujeres y derecho, hombres); las y los candidatos estarán designados con un número que antecede a su nombre; mientras que en los recuadros con letras rosas se colocará el poder por el cual es postulada esa persona: PE: Poder Ejecutivo; PL: Poder Legislativo; PJ: Poder Judicial y EF: Ministras y ministros en funciones.
Para elegir a un candidato o candidata se deberá colocar el número que le corresponde al nombre de quien se desea votar en los recuadros blancos. En el caso de ministros se deberán elegir cinco mujeres y cuatro hombres; para magistraturas de la Sala Superior del Tribunal Electoral se elegirá un hombre y una mujer; para magistraturas del Tribunal de Disciplina Judicial, tres mujeres y dos hombres; y para magistraturas de Salas Regionales del Tribunal Electoral, dos mujeres y un hombre.
En el caso de Magistraturas de Circuito (boleta rosa) y Juzgados de Distrito (boleta amarilla) se tendrá como elemento adicional las especialidades por color, cada boleta tendrá hasta siete especialidades como penal, administrativa y civil.
Una vez que se emita el voto las boletas deberán ser colocadas en la única urna que habrá en las casillas.

chevron-right,"Canandaigua, N.Y. — Sen. Chuck Schumer and members of the VA Finger Lakes Health Care are leading a new call to save Veterans Affairs from sweeping federal cuts.
Recent reductions from the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has called for the elimination of more than 80,000 jobs and a number of services from VA's nationwide.
The VA and Schumer held a press conference Wednesday, saying the changes will only hurt veterans services and cause chaos.
""They're killing the people that work here,"" said VA employee Ron Orlowski. ""They are going to be killing the veterans because they are not going to be getting the care they need. These veterans were promised care, they should have world class care. The VA provides world class care. Continue to provide it.""
""I will not rest,"" Schumer said. ""I will fight every day to restore these cuts, to restore the jobs, and most importantly to give our veterans the healthcare they so need and deserve.""

"Países chegam a consenso sobre tratado das pandemias, em sinal a favor de multilateralismo e OMS | Brasil | Valor Econômico","Após mais de três anos de negociação, os países-membros da Organização Mundial da Saúde (OMS) chegaram a um consenso para o acordo global que prevê uma ação conjunta em futuras crises sanitárias. Chamado de Tratado das Pandemias, o pacto estava sendo discutido desde dezembro de 2021 para formular respostas unificadas após a pandemia da covid-19.
O consenso do acordo foi obtido nas primeiras horas desta quarta-feira (16), durante reunião do Órgão Negociador Intergovernamental (INB, na sigla em inglês) em Genebra, na Suíça. O Brasil participou de todo processo de negociação como representante da região das Américas.
O próximo passo agora é levar o texto do tratado, que tem 37 artigos, à Assembleia Mundial de Saúde, órgão máximo de deliberação da OMS, marcada para 19 de maio. O documento ainda precisará ser ratificado pelos países que fazem parte do organismo multilateral. Uma vez isso feito, o documento passará a ter caráter vinculativo, isto é, deverá ser seguido obrigatoriamente por seus signatários.
O anúncio do consenso vem meses após os Estados Unidos deixarem as negociações pelo tratado. Em janeiro, quando Donald Trump assumiu a Casa Branca, o presidente americano determinou que o país abandonasse as tratativas e saísse da OMS.
De acordo com fontes a par das negociações, a saída dos EUA serviu como gatilho para que os membros do INB e países que participavam das discussões se mobilizassem em prol de um consenso, sobretudo para manifestar um apoio ao multilateralismo em geral e à OMS — que são focos de constantes críticas de Trump.
Até então, as tratativas estavam travadas e chegaram a ser postergadas no ano passado, quando não foi possível chegar a um acordo entre os países sobre como deveria funcionar o Tratado das Pandemias.
“Ao chegarem a um consenso sobre o Tratado da Pandemia, não apenas estabeleceram um pacto geracional para tornar o mundo mais seguro, como também demonstraram que o multilateralismo está vivo e forte, e que, mesmo em um mundo dividido, as nações ainda podem trabalhar juntas para encontrar um entendimento mútuo e uma resposta conjunta a ameaças compartilhadas”, disse o diretor-geral da OMS, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.
Agora, com o consenso, o tratado propõe adoção de medidas concretas para prevenção de pandemias, incluindo a abordagem ""Uma Só Saúde"" — que integra a saúde humana, animal, vegetal e ambiental; o fortalecimento da pesquisas; o estabelecimento de uma rede global de cadeia de suprimentos e logística; a mobilização de uma força de trabalho nacional e global para emergências em saúde; entre outras determinações.
O acordo também ressalta que não irá intervir na soberania dos países para tratar questões de saúde pública dentro de seus territórios nem dá a OMS poder para impor medidas ou direcionar decisões dos próprios governos centrais.
Em nota, o Itamaraty e o Ministério da Saúde comemoraram a chegada ao consenso: “O acordo logrou consolidar compromissos claros por parte dos governos e avanços em uma série de temas importantes para o Brasil e para o Sul Global. O Brasil seguirá engajado nos esforços multilaterais voltados à melhoria da governança da saúde global”.
Apesar do acordo ser visto como um avanço, há ainda alguns pontos que ficaram sem definição e que precisarão ser debatidos a posteriori, como o acesso e repartição de benefícios de patógenos, que será colocado como um anexo ao Tratado das Pandemias.

Grand opening ceremony held for aerospace manufacturing plant at CVG Airport,"Grand opening ceremony held for aerospace manufacturing plant at CVG Airport
A $12.2 million aerospace manufacturing plant has officially opened at Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport.
The new location, which will be run by L2 Aviation, is expected to reach full operation by the end of 2025 and will employ 250 people.
L2 Aviation is a Texas-based avionics design, consulting, manufacturing, and engineering company. It was founded in 1997.
A grand opening and a ribbon-cutting ceremony was held on Wednesday. It included remarks from Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear.
“Kentucky’s aviation and aerospace industry has seen tremendous growth in the last few years,” Beshear said. “This investment from L2 Aviation will bring hundreds of quality job opportunities to the Northern Kentucky region and is yet another example of a company believing in what this great state has to offer. I am happy to be here today celebrating this exciting next step for the company and the Boone County community. I want to thank L2’s leadership for their commitment to Kentucky and congratulate them on today’s grand opening.”",2025-04-17T00:19:00.000+03:00,https://www.wlwt.com/article/grand-opening-ceremony-aerospace-cvg-airport-l2-aviation/64505701,Matthew Dietz,positive

"Canada, Japan Led Foreign Surge in Treasuries Buying in February","Foreign holdings of U.S. Treasuries surged in February by the most since June 2021, with Canada and Japan among the biggest net buyers during a month that preceded the bond market’s recent turmoil.
Total overseas holdings of Treasury securities jumped by US$290 billion to a record $8.82 trillion in February, Treasury Department figures showed Wednesday. Foreign buyers purchased a net $106.2 billion of long-term, and $73.2 billion of short-term, Treasuries in the month.
Canada, which had mounted net sales of Treasuries in January, more than made up for those in February, with net purchases of $46.5 billion in long-term Treasuries, the data showed. Some market observers had noted the January transactions came alongside pressure by President Donald Trump on the U.S. northern neighbor. Tensions have since escalated further.
Japan’s holdings, the largest overseas stockpile, climbed by $46.6 billion in February — the most since February 2020. Standing at $1.13 trillion, holdings are at the highest level since April 2024.
China’s Treasuries holdings also climbed, by $23.5 billion to $784.3 billion. The nation sold a net $4.8 billion of longer-term U.S. government securities, but added a net $15.1 billion of short-term Treasuries. The overall gain also reflects a boost in valuations, as Treasuries climbed in February. China is the second-largest overseas holder of Treasuries, and has recently been the subject of speculation with regard to the potential for retaliatory sales in the face of Trump’s steep tariff hikes.
The UK, the third-largest foreign holder, saw its stockpile go up by $10.1 billion, to $750.3 billion. Belgium, whose holdings include Chinese custodial accounts according to market analysts, held $394.7 billion of Treasuries in February, up $17 billion from the previous month. Belgium saw net sales of both long-term and short-term Treasuries, adding up to less than $1 billion for the month.
The latest breakdown of holders illustrates the foreign appetite for U.S. debt about a month before the brunt of Trump’s expansive tariffs. In the wake of his April 2 announcement, the $29 trillion Treasuries market suffered the worst rout since 2001.
Data in coming months will be scrutinized for any signs that foreign nations are reducing their Treasury holdings outright. While the figures for foreign holdings for April won’t be due out until June, some market participants expressed skepticism over that narrative. Former Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen earlier this week said she wouldn’t expect China to engage in such action.
Over a longer-term perspective, foreign investors’ role in the Treasuries market has diminished relative to the peak reached in 2008, when they accounted for over half of the market, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. In recent months, the ratio has been about 30 per cent.
Holdings of the Cayman Islands — viewed as a popular domicile for leveraged investors such as hedge funds, — went up by $13.3 billion, to $417.8 billion. Market participants have said the recent volatility in the Treasuries market has been in part related to hedge funds unwinding a strategy known as the basis trade.
Wednesday’s figures also showed that United Arab Emirates’ holdings of Treasuries soared nearly $43 billion in the first two months of this year, and now stand at $119.9 billion — roughly double where they were in January last year.

México recuperó más de 2 mil piezas arqueológicas en el último año - La Crónica de Hoy México,"La Secretaría de Relaciones Exteriores de México (SRE) informó este miércoles que se han recuperado 2 mil 42 piezas arqueológicas que estaban en el extranjero, desde el inicio del Gobierno de la presidenta Claudia Sheinbaum en octubre pasado.
“Durante estos primeros meses, a través de la Consejería Jurídica de la Cancillería, hemos recuperado 2 mil 42 piezas. Creo que ha sido un buen esfuerzo que muestra, todavía, el enorme potencial que tenemos para seguir trayendo (las figuras) a su lugar de origen, de donde nunca debieron haber salido”, afirmó Juan Ramón de la Fuente.
En un encuentro con el Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia (INAH) para reforzar la colaboración en la restitución del patrimonio cultural, De la Fuente aseguró que estos esfuerzos son continuidad del Gobierno del expresidente Andrés Manuel López Obrador (2018-2024), cuando se restituyeron más de 14 mil piezas.
El secretario destacó que el programa instaurado en la administración anterior busca ampliarse a toda la red consultar y todas las representaciones diplomáticas, por instrucciones de la presidenta Sheinbaum, quien asumió el cargo el 1 de octubre.
La reunión ocurrió en el Museo Nacional de Antropología de la capital mexicana, en el contexto de la restitución de una pieza de barro de origen prehispánico con rasgos de la cultura olmeca, que el canciller calificó como “particularmente importante” en la cronología de la influencia de la civilización olmeca en la región.
La figura, que se recuperó a través del Consulado de Los Ángeles, se elaboró en el Altiplano Central mexicano entre los años 800 a 400 a.C, apuntó.
A nivel global, las embajadas y consulados de México han recuperado más de 16 mil piezas culturales desde el sexenio anterior, cuando comenzó el combate de subastas en ciudades como Nueva York, París y Roma, en las que aparecen objetos robados o que pertenecen al patrimonio de México. Además, han intensificado las demandas ante gobiernos extranjeros para recuperar piezas arqueológicas y artísticas.",2025-04-17T00:27:00.000+03:00,https://www.cronica.com.mx/cultura/2025/04/16/mexico-recupero-mas-de-2-mil-piezas-arqueologicas-en-el-ultimo-ano,Por Redacción Crónica,positive

Why Lockheed Martin Stock Soared While the Market Sagged Today
Lockheed Martin(NYSE: LMT) and the wider U.S. defense sector provided lift to the company's stock on an otherwise bearish Wednesday trading session. Lockheed Martin's shares closed the day almost 2% higher in price, providing quite the contrast to the tumbling S&P 500's (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) 2.2% decline.The analyst in question was Kristine Liwag of veteran white-shoe investment bank Morgan Stanley. Well before market open that day, Liwag changed her Lockheed Martin recommendation to overweight (i.e., buy) from equal weight (hold). In doing so, she added $50 per share to his price target on the storied defense stock, to $575 per share.The pundit's new take on the company was part of a broader Morgan Stanley update on defense industry stocks. According to reports, the investment bank rates the entire sector as ""attractive,"" as opposed to its formerly cautious view that it'll be an in-line performer. The company sees the U.S. defense budget being set at $1 trillion this year, amid growing international exports of combat goods, as a positive for these stocks. Continue reading

WHO: Historic agreement on pandemic preparedness,"After three years of intense negotiations, member states of the World Health Organization (WHO) have reached a consensus on a historic text aimed at preparing for and responding to future pandemics, AFP reports. ""This marks an important milestone in our common journey towards a safer world. You have made history,"" WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told delegates. The agreement will be subject to formal approval at the World Health Assembly in May, but the consensus already reached represents a crucial moment for international cooperation in public health.
• A victory for multilateralism
The final text was approved after a final round of marathon negotiations, marking a moment of euphoria among WHO delegates. ""By reaching this consensus, states have established a generational agreement for global security and demonstrated that, despite a divided world, nations can work together to respond to common threats,"" Ghebreyesus stressed. The agreement comes five years after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has caused millions of deaths and had a devastating impact on the global economy. According to the WHO, the world remains vulnerable to a new pandemic, and this text aims to change that.
• Technology transfer - one of the central stakes
The negotiations were difficult, especially around the transfer of technology related to the production of vaccines and other health products. Developing countries insisted on the need for equitable access, evoking inequities during the COVID-19 pandemic, when rich countries monopolized vaccine doses.
After much debate, a compromise formula was reached, which provides for the transfer of technology agreed upon, maintaining a voluntary nature, but assuming the principle of cooperation.
• A global system for access to medical products
The agreement introduces a new mechanism: the ""Pathogen Access and Benefit-Sharing System"" (PABS), designed to ensure a more equitable distribution of medical products derived from pathogens - such as vaccines, tests and treatments. The text also aims to expand global supply and logistics networks to respond more effectively in the event of a crisis. ""It is a historic agreement for health security, equity and international solidarity,"" said Anne-Claire Amprou, France's ambassador for global health and co-chair of the negotiation process.
• ""The virus can be worse than a war""
Ghebreyesus warned of the consequences of inaction, arguing that a dangerous virus can have more devastating effects than an armed conflict: ""The cost of inaction is much higher. The virus is the worst enemy - it can be worse than a war."" The agreement comes in a difficult context for multilateralism and international cooperation, marked by geopolitical crises and the US withdrawal from the WHO during the Trump administration, which generated tensions and a funding gap.",2025-04-17T00:30:44.517+03:00,https://www.bursa.ro/who-historic-agreement-on-pandemic-preparedness-62434553,BURSA,positive

Liberty Energy Inc. Announces First Quarter 2025 Financial and Operational Results - 16.04.2025,"Liberty Energy Inc. (NYSE: LBRT; “Liberty” or the “Company”) announced today first quarter 2025 financial and operational results.
Summary Results and Highlights
Revenue of $977 million, a 4% sequential increase Net income of $20 million, or $0.12 fully diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) Adjusted EBITDA 1 of $168 million, an 8% sequential increase Achieved 12% TTM Adjusted Pre-Tax Return on Capital Employed (“ROCE”) 2 Distributed $37 million to shareholders through share repurchases and cash dividends Repurchased and retired 1.0% of shares outstanding during the first quarter, and a cumulative 15.9% of shares outstanding since reinstating the repurchase program in July 2022 Expanded LPI’s distributed power systems offering with the acquisition of IMG Energy Solutions (“IMG”) Successfully tested the latest digiPrime technology advancement, the industry’s first natural gas variable speed pump Established new benchmark in critical equipment component longevity utilizing our AI-driven predictive maintenance systems, reducing total cost of asset ownership “Liberty delivered a solid first quarter, with revenue of $977 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $168 million, and distributed $37 million to shareholders through opportunistic share repurchases and dividends. We saw strong sequential improvement in utilization across our fleet, reached new heights in operational efficiencies and safety performance, and set a new high watermark in asset lifespan for equipment components,” commented Ron Gusek, Chief Executive Officer. “Our early year results demonstrate a positive rebound from the fourth quarter of 2024, a trend that has continued into the second quarter.”
“In recent months, tariff announcements and a more aggressive OPEC+ production strategy have sent ripples across the energy sector. Today, we have excess demand for Liberty services as our customers align themselves with top-tier providers in a clear industry ‘flight to quality,’” continued Mr. Gusek. “While North American producers have not yet meaningfully changed development plans, we expect our customers to assess a range of scenarios in anticipation of commodity price pressure, and we are staying close to our partners in this dynamic market.”
“Liberty’s differentiation is the engine of our success through both prosperous and challenging times. Our strategy of delivering strong long-term returns with a unique culture, deep customer relationships, and superior performance consistently drives differential demand for Liberty fleets,” continued Mr. Gusek. “Today, we are better positioned than ever to navigate market uncertainties, with greater scale, vertical integration, technological advancements, and a fortress balance sheet. Prior cycles have proved the resilience of our strategy, of leading the industry with discipline while strategically enhancing our competitive edge. We will adhere to our principles and continue to build enduring advantages in today’s rapidly evolving market.”
Outlook
As global oil markets contend with tariff impacts, geopolitical tensions, and oil supply concerns, North American producers are evaluating a range of macroeconomic scenarios. The recent pause on tariffs has momentarily eased pressure on the global economy, and in turn, global oil demand concerns. However, markets remain focused on supply side dynamics, including the evolving OPEC+ production strategy and potential constraints on Iranian, Russian, and Venezuelan oil exports. Natural gas fundamentals are more favorable on rising LNG export capacity demand in support of global energy security.

Dieser Gold-Kupferproduzent geht steil gestern 09:00 While the current tumult in commodity prices is not immediately driving changes in North American activity, we expect oil producers are evaluating a range of scenarios in anticipation of oil price pressure. Concurrently, gas producers could prove to be beneficiaries of potentially lower associated gas production in oily basins.
In contrast to prior oil and gas cycles, recent years have seen steadier activity in both higher and lower commodity price environments. Larger, well-capitalized producers, that comprise a larger portion of shale production today, are better able to withstand a broader range of commodity prices, while smaller producers are more sensitive to commodity prices. Since the pandemic-driven downturn, the energy sector has seen significant consolidation as well as a strong focus on capital discipline and balance sheet strength, and most producers have targeted flat to modest production growth. Today’s frac activity simply supports maintenance of current oil production levels, mitigating the possibility of steep declines experienced by the service industry in past cycles. While macroeconomic risk could lead to lower oil production in North America, the industry is operating from a higher base of production today than prior cycles, implying a decline in service activity would likely be less pronounced than in the past.
Liberty’s differential service platform is stronger today than at any point in the last 14 years. Our unmatched scale, integrated services, robust supply chain, and advanced technology systems uniquely enable us to deliver more value, lowering the total cost to produce a barrel of oil. Fleet modernization with advanced sensors, real-time data capture, and enhanced data visualization tools, is driving tangible benefits and improving decision-making, allowing our teams and customers to respond faster and more effectively in a dynamic market. We are also working closely with our customers to bring innovative engineering and designs to their completion strategies. This integrated, high-performance model reinforces our position as the service provider of choice in a competitive market.
“We started the year with positive momentum and are currently anticipating sequential growth in revenue and profitability in the second quarter from higher utilization. Amidst market uncertainties we are working closely with our customers and suppliers to deliver superior services and drive greater efficiencies that could help partially offset tariff-related impacts. We expect our strong balance sheet will allow us to navigate any potential slowdown while executing on our long-term strategic plan,” commented Mr. Gusek. “We are also actively assessing the implications of tariffs across our business and have already begun mitigation efforts.”
“Strategic investment has allowed us to develop new markets and lead technology innovation and operational efficiency in the industry. Growing power demand from data centers, manufacturing, mining, and industrial electrification is enabling us to expand our power services beyond the oilfield. The acquisition of IMG, a leader in distributed power systems, opportunistically augments LPI with power plant EPC management and PJM utility market expertise. We are excited by the opportunity ahead to expand in these key growth areas,” continued Mr. Gusek.
Share Repurchase Program
During the quarter ended March 31, 2025, Liberty repurchased and retired 1,546,138 shares of Class A common stock at an average of $15.50 per share, representing 1.0% of shares outstanding, for approximately $24 million.
Liberty has cumulatively repurchased and retired 15.9% of shares outstanding at program commencement on July 25, 2022. Total remaining authorization for future common share repurchases is approximately $270 million.
The shares may be repurchased from time to time in open market transactions, through block trades, in privately negotiated transactions, through derivative transactions or by other means in accordance with federal securities laws. The timing, as well as the number and value of shares repurchased under the program, will be determined by the Company at its discretion and will depend on a variety of factors, including management’s assessment of the intrinsic value of the Company’s common stock, the market price of the Company’s common stock, general market and economic conditions, available liquidity, compliance with the Company’s debt and other agreements, applicable legal requirements, and other considerations. The exact number of shares to be repurchased by the Company is not guaranteed, and the program may be suspended, modified, or discontinued at any time without prior notice. The Company expects to fund the repurchases by using cash on hand, borrowings under its revolving credit facility and expected free cash flow to be generated through the authorization period.
Cash Dividend
During the quarter ended March 31, 2025, the Company paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.08 per share of Class A common stock, or approximately $13 million in aggregate to shareholders.
On April 15, 2025, the Board declared a cash dividend of $0.08 per share of Class A common stock, to be paid on June 20, 2025 to holders of record as of June 6, 2025.
Future declarations of quarterly cash dividends are subject to approval by the Board of Directors and to the Board’s continuing determination that the declarations of dividends are in the best interests of Liberty and its stockholders. Future dividends may be adjusted at the Board’s discretion based on market conditions and capital availability.

Please see the supplemental financial information in the table under “Reconciliation of Net Income to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA” at the end of this earnings release for a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure of Adjusted EBITDA to its most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.
2 Adjusted Pre-Tax Return on Capital Employed is a non-U.S. GAAP operational measure. Please see the supplemental financial information in the table under “Calculation of Adjusted Pre-Tax Return on Capital Employed” at the end of this earnings release for a calculation of this measure.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This earnings release includes unaudited non-GAAP financial and operational measures, including EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Net Income per Diluted Share, and Adjusted Pre-Tax Return on Capital Employed (“ROCE”). We believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial and operational measures provides useful information about our financial performance and results of operations. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA adjusted to eliminate the effects of items such as non-cash stock-based compensation, new fleet or new basin start-up costs, fleet lay-down costs, gain or loss on the disposal of assets, gain or loss on investments, net, bad debt reserves, transaction and other costs, the loss or gain on remeasurement of liability under our tax receivable agreements, and other non-recurring expenses that management does not consider in assessing ongoing performance.
Our board of directors, management, investors, and lenders use EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to assess our financial performance because it allows them to compare our operating performance on a consistent basis across periods by removing the effects of our capital structure (such as varying levels of interest expense), asset base (such as depreciation, depletion, and amortization) and other items that impact the comparability of financial results from period to period. We present EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA because we believe they provide useful information regarding the factors and trends affecting our business in addition to measures calculated under U.S. GAAP.
We present Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per Diluted Share because we believe such measures provide useful information to investors regarding our operating performance by excluding the after-tax impacts of unusual or one-time benefits or costs, including items such as gain or loss on investments, net and transaction and other costs, primarily because management views the excluded items to be outside of our normal operating results. We define Adjusted Net Income as net income after eliminating the effects of such excluded items and Adjusted Net Income per Diluted Share as Adjusted Net Income divided by the number of weighted average diluted shares outstanding. Management analyzes net income without the impact of these items as an indicator of performance to identify underlying trends in our business.
We define ROCE as the ratio of adjusted pre-tax net income (adding back income tax and certain adjustments that include tax receivable agreement impacts, gain or loss on investments, net, and transaction and other costs, when applicable) for the twelve months ended March 31, 2025 to Average Capital Employed. Average Capital Employed is the simple average of total capital employed (both debt and equity) as of March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024. ROCE is presented based on our management’s belief that this non-GAAP measure is useful information to investors when evaluating our profitability and the efficiency with which management has employed capital over time. Our management uses ROCE for that purpose. ROCE is not a measure of financial performance under U.S. GAAP and should not be considered an alternative to net income, as defined by U.S. GAAP.
Non-GAAP financial and operational measures do not have any standardized meaning and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. The presentation of non-GAAP financial and operational measures is not intended to be a substitute for, and should not be considered in isolation from, the financial measures reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP. See the tables entitled Reconciliation and Calculation of Non-GAAP Financial and Operational Measures for a reconciliation or calculation of the non-GAAP financial or operational measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure.

Os preços do petróleo fecharam em alta nesta quarta-feira (16), impulsionados pelos sinais de abertura de Pequim às negociações com os Estados Unidos sobre as tarifas alfandegárias, mas estagnaram ao final da sessão devido aos comentários do presidente do Fed, banco central americano.
O preço do barril Brent do Mar do Norte para entrega em junho subiu 1,82%, a 65,85 dólares.
Seu equivalente americano, o West Texas Intermediate, para entrega em maio avançou 1,86%, para 62,47 dólares.
Nesta quarta, a China anunciou a nomeação de um novo chefe para as negociações comerciais e alertou que não temia ""lutar"" com os Estados Unidos, ao mesmo tempo em que defendeu o diálogo.
""Se os Estados Unidos realmente querem resolver o assunto mediante o diálogo e a negociação, deveriam parar de exercer pressão extrema, parar de ameaçar e chantagear e falar com a China com base na igualdade, no respeito e no benefício mútuo"", disse, nesta quarta, Lin Jian, porta-voz do Ministério das Relações Exteriores da China.
Na véspera, a porta-voz da Casa Branca, Karoline Leavitt, havia dito que ""a bola está no campo da China"".
O presidente americano, Donald Trump, ""afirmou, de novo, que claramente está aberto a um acordo com a China. Mas é a China que precisa de um acordo com os Estados Unidos"" e não o contrário, disse a porta-voz à imprensa.
Essas perspectivas fizeram subir os preços do petróleo.
Ao final da sessão, os operadores se mostraram pessimistas devido ao discurso do presidente do Federal Reserve (Fed), banco central americano, Jerome Powell, que exerceu certa pressão sobre os preços.

"Pared-back 'Right to Play' bill advances in General Assembly, awaits Senate action","SPRINGFIELD — The Illinois House gave its approval to legislation that would give high school athletes a limited right to compete in non-school events or on non-school teams during the same season in which they play for their school.
The House voted 68-39 on April 9 to pass a scaled-back version of a bill known as the Right to Play Act. It would partially override an existing rule of the Illinois High School Association that says students who participate on a school team may not also participate on a non-school team or compete in outside tournaments or events in the same sport during the same season, unless they obtain permission from both their school and IHSA.
The association currently allows students to obtain as many as three waivers in a season to compete in outside contests or tournaments if those events are sanctioned by the sport’s national governing body.
Rep. Janet Yang-Rohr, D-Naperville, said she thinks that rule is too restrictive because it doesn’t allow for events sponsored by international sports organizations.
“Our athletes right now in Illinois have to decline invitations from FIFA (the international soccer governing body), from the Olympic development program, from offers to play with national teams in Canada and Scotland, because these IHSA rules compel the organization to deny their waiver requests,” she said on the House floor. “This legislation will finally be able to let those student athletes participate in those events too.”
Under the amended bill, student athletes would be able to obtain waivers for as many as two outside events per year, including “all-star team” events. But they would only need the agreement of their school’s principal or athletics director, not IHSA. The bill also would not require the events to be sanctioned by any official governing body.
That is significantly more restrictive than the original bill, which would have removed the prohibition on simultaneous participation almost entirely. It would have prohibited participating in both a school competition or practice and a non-school activity on the same day.

That proposal passed out of the House Education Policy Committee in March, despite warnings from some critics that allowing unrestricted dual participation could endanger the health and safety of the athletes while also setting up the possibility of conflict between a school coach and non-school coach.
But Rep. Martin McLaughlin, R-Barrington Hills, who voted for the amended bill, said during floor debate that he would have preferred going even further in limiting the authority of IHSA.
“This is an unfortunate turn with your amendments, but I completely appreciate … what you had to do to get this started,” he said during floor debate. “But frankly, let’s next year – and I’ll join you – get this completely wiped out. Get the IHSA back in the lane where they should be, which is to be fair and to allow all these students to have every equal opportunity for scholarships that they can get.”
IHSA Executive Director Craig Anderson said in an email Wednesday that the association still opposes the proposed legislation because it puts principals and athletic directors in charge of deciding whether a student should be granted a waiver.
“It’s my understanding that the schools prefer a process whereby review of such participation is considered by the Association to create equity in opportunities across the membership,” Anderson said.
The bill now awaits further action in the Senate.

El excandidato del correísmo a vicepresidente de Ecuador agradeció a Gustavo Petro oferta de asilo,"El excandidato del correísmo a vicepresidente de Ecuador agradeció a Gustavo Petro oferta de asilo
Diego Borja había denunciado que presuntamente funcionarios del servicio de migración de Ecuador habían intentado impedirle salir del país para pasar a Colombia donde iba a pasar la Semana Santa con su esposa.
Diego Borja, que fue el candidato del correísmo a vicepresidente de Ecuador dentro de la candidatura presidencial de Luisa González, agradeció el ofrecimiento realizado este miércoles, 16 de abril, por el presidente de Colombia, Gustavo Petro, de dar asilo a opositores ecuatorianos que presuntamente formarían parte de una lista para dificultarles salir del país.
En la madrugada del lunes, 14 de abril, Borja había denunciado que presuntamente funcionarios del servicio de migración de Ecuador habían intentado impedirle salir del país para pasar a Colombia donde, según el también exministro, iba a pasar la Semana Santa con su esposa.
El excandidato vicepresidencial llegó a asegurar que le había intentado detener, mientras que el Ministerio del Interior contradijo esa versión en un comunicado donde aseguró que se le aplicaron los procedimientos habituales.
El Gobierno detalló que Borja apareció en el control migratorio con gorra y mascarilla y que, cuando se le pidió que se identificase correctamente, abandonó abruptamente el lugar sin ni siquiera recoger su documento de identidad ni completar el proceso de salida del país.
Posteriormente, el medio digital La Posta publicó una lista de alrededor de cien personas opositoras al Gobierno, la mayoría vinculada a Revolución Ciudadana, que presuntamente tendrían una alerta migratoria para complicarles entrar o salir del país.
Tras ello, Petro, que el martes 15 de abril cuestionó los resultados electorales por haberse celebrado la elección bajo uno de los sucesivos estados de excepción decretados por el presidente de Ecuador, Daniel Noboa, afirmó en redes sociales que “hay una lista negra de opositores en Ecuador que están siendo perseguidos”.
“El gobierno de Colombia le dará asilo a todo el que llegue a territorio colombiano”, anunció el mandatario colombiano.
Borja agradeció a Petro “por su solidaridad” y comentó que se encuentra actualmente en territorio colombiano, “a salvo de la injusta e ilegal persecución orquestada por el Gobierno de Noboa”.
Entre las personas que figuran en la lista difundida este miércoles está Verónica Sarauz, la viuda del candidato presidencial asesinado en 2023 Fernando Villavicencio, quien denunció en redes sociales que en la noche del martes fue retenida durante más de una hora en el aeropuerto de Quito cuando intentaba ingresar al país.
“Sin explicación válida ni causa aparente, fui retenida durante más de una hora, sin permitirme el ingreso al país, bajo vigilancia y hostigamiento de hasta cuatro agentes policiales simultáneamente, quienes me custodiaban como si se tratara de una operación contra el crimen”, relató Sarauz.
“Mi pasaporte fue llevado y retirado en múltiples ocasiones, supuestamente para “revisarlo”, sin que se me diera información clara ni formal sobre el motivo. Solo después de mi enérgica protesta, se me indicó que existía una “alerta por un homónimo”, excusa burda que revela una operación orquestada con fines de amedrentamiento político”, añadió.
Noboa fue reelegido para el periodo 2025-2029 tras imponerse por casi doce puntos porcentuales de diferencia a González, que no aceptó los resultados y denunció un “fraude” frente a la opinión contraria de otros miembros de Revolución Ciudadana que sí han reconocido el triunfo del mandatario.
Asimismo, las misiones de observación electoral de la Unión Europea (UE) y de la Organización de Estados Americanos (OEA), las dos mayores delegaciones, quienes han avalado los resultados y han declarado transparente el proceso al no constatar evidencias de fraude.

Texas court vacates capital murder conviction of Joe David Padron,"CORPUS CHRISTI, Tx — The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals has vacated the capital murder conviction of Joe David Padron, agreeing that false testimony led to his wrongful conviction for a 2002 double homicide.
The court's ruling comes after Nueces County District Court Judge Inna Klein determined that prosecutors presented false testimony during Padron's original trial.
Padron, who was initially sentenced to life in prison for the shooting deaths of two men in a Corpus Christi drug house, served 19 years before being released on bail in 2023, pending the court's decision.
Mike Ware, Executive Director of the Innocence Project of Texas and Padron's attorney, emphasized the significance of the court's decision. ""Both Judge Klein and the Court of Criminal Appeals recognized that two of the prosecution’s witnesses gave false testimony causing Mr. Padron’s wrongful conviction. Although nothing can give back the time he spent wrongfully imprisoned, we are hopeful that this ruling will give Joe David and his family some sense of justice and the peace they deserve,"" Ware said.
The case's exoneration was bolstered by additional evidence, including testimony that one of the actual perpetrators of the murders confessed, specifically named the three other perpetrators he committed the murders with, and that Padron had nothing to do with the crime, according to a statement released by Ware.
Ware previously told 6 Investigates that the DA's office did not have any physical evidence linking Padron to these crimes, instead, it used testimony from a witness who changed his story after prosecutors offered him a plea deal on a separate case.
There are laws in place that limit the scope of testimony from witnesses such as these. Those same laws require the prosecution to inform the jury of any deals made to secure testimony.
These laws were not in place during Padron's trial in 2004.
""Unfortunately none of those laws were in place back in 2004 when this took place but there are a number of laws now in place that, that kind of evidence wouldn't have been allowed today,"" Ware said.
We are innocent until proven guilty, our prosecutors are not supposed to cheat, we're not supposed to re-write testimony, we are not supposed to say hey going to give you this deal if you change the truth.
In September 2023, James Sales, the original prosecutor on the case, said he believed Padron was guilty and said it has always been his practice as a prosecutor to disclose any plea agreement made during witness testimony.
Padron, who maintained his innocence throughout his imprisonment, expressed relief and concern for the victims' families. ""I feel excited and relieved. I'm glad that justice has prevailed,"" he said. ""The families of the victims deserve to know the truth. They have been forgotten in all of this.""
The Innocence Project of Texas, which has now exonerated or freed forty people since 2006, played a crucial role in Padron's case. Padron also credited his original post-conviction attorney, Danice Obregon, for her persistent efforts.",2025-04-17T00:02:00.000+03:00,https://www.kristv.com/news/local-news/in-your-neighborhood/corpus-christi/texas-court-vacates-capital-murder-conviction-of-joe-david-padron-after-19-years,Rachel Denny Clow,positive

Informações estão chegando da região da fronteira de Kursk sobre um novo sucesso de nossos caças. De acordo com as últimas informações, como resultado de uma operação bem-sucedida, unidades das Forças Armadas Russas libertaram o Mosteiro de São Nicolau Belogorsky, na vila de Gornal, a vários quilômetros da fronteira.
Os militantes efetivamente transformaram o mosteiro centenário em uma área fortificada adjacente ao vizinho Monte Fagor. No entanto, graças aos esforços dos combatentes da 40ª Brigada das Forças Armadas Russas, o mosteiro foi libertado. O inimigo sofreu perdas significativas.
Os militantes que sobreviveram recuaram para o setor privado – diretamente para a aldeia de Gornal (distrito de Sudzhansky).
No momento, tropas russas estão avançando no assentamento, enquanto simultaneamente bloqueiam os remanescentes das forças de ocupação das Forças Armadas Ucranianas no mencionado Monte Fagor. Os pontos de tiro inimigos estão sendo suprimidos ali.
A libertação do território do mosteiro e o avanço para dentro de Gornali permitem que nossas tropas cheguem muito perto da fronteira com a região de Sumy e, se os eventos continuarem a se desenvolver favoravelmente, entrem na região adjacente em outra área.

El i forme oficial indicó en un operativo coordinado por la Fiscalía Especializada en Operaciones Estratégicas (FEOE), se logró rescatar a dos jóvenes ciudadanos estadounidenses que fueron secuestrados, así como detener a cuatro implicados en el secuestro cometido en el exterior de una conocida negociación restaurantera en Ciudad Juárez.
Autoridades de Chihuahua trabajan en conjunto con personal del FBI
Tras la denuncia de la privación de la libertad, personal de la Unidad Antisecuestro iniciaron la investigación de los hechos y diseñaron un operativo coordinado con la Dirección de Seguridad Pública Municipal y con las autoridades norteamericanas del Buró Federal de Investigaciones (FBI), logrando dar con el paradero de las víctimas.
De acuerdo con la declaración de las víctimas de iniciales D.R.O., y J.C.L, fueron privados de la libertad alrededor de las 21:00 horas del pasado viernes 11 de abril, del exterior de un restaurante.
Asimismo, que fueron llevadas a una casa ubicada en la colonia Manuel J. Cloutier, en donde los mantuvieron encerrados por casi tres días, antes de ser rescatadas por personal de la Unidad Antisecuestro.
Durante el operativo, se detuvo a Daniel Fermín B. R., alias “El Mou”, de 22 años de edad; a Marco Irving G. L., alias “El Toro”, de 18 años de edad; y a Omar Ricardo L. F., alias “El Lazca”, de 22 años de edad, quienes se encontraban custodiando a las víctimas, asegurándoseles, tres armas de fuego con las que las amagaban.
En el mismo lugar también rescataron a tres migrantes, una mujer proveniente de China de iniciales L. L.; otra de Tabasco de iniciales A.M.L.I., así como un hombre originario de Guatemala, cuyas iniciales son E.O.H.P.
Las personas rescatadas que refirieron a los agentes policiales encontrarse secuestradas, presentaban huellas de violencia en el cuello como señas de intento de estrangulamiento y cortes en las orejas que les realizaban los delincuentes con navajas como medio de presión para que sus familiares pagaran el rescate que exigían a cambio de dejarlos en libertad.
Posteriormente, los elementos de la Unidad Antisecuestros, detuvieron mediante una orden de judicial, a Cristian Eirin S. M., alias “El Coquito”, de 22 años de edad, a quien le fueron asegurados diversos billetes que formaban parte del dinero que fue pagado como rescate de una de las víctimas.

"Semana Santa: el pueblo argentino que se convirtió en peatonal y está entre los más lindos del mundo, según la ONU - El Cronista","Semana Santa: el pueblo argentino que se convirtió en peatonal y está entre los más lindos del mundo, según la ONU
Este pueblo es el ideal si estás buscando escaparte en Semana Santa. Rodeado de naturaleza y actividades, está situado a 900 km de Buenos Aires.
Con la llegada de Semana Santa, muchos ya están armando valijas en busca de un destino que combine naturaleza, calma y algo de historia. Mientras los clásicos se llenan de visitantes, hay joyitas escondidas en el mapa que ofrecen una experiencia totalmente distinta.
Entre ellas, La Carolina, un pequeño pueblo minero de San Luis, se posiciona como una de las escapadas más fascinantes y menos exploradas para este feriado extra largo.
Semana Santa: cuánto cuestan los huevos de Pascua y cuáles conviene comprar
Semana Santa: cómo estará el tiempo y qué temperaturas se esperan en el AMBA
Un viaje al pasado entre oro, montañas y calles detenidas en el tiempo
A unos 900 kilómetros de la Ciudad de Buenos Aires, este rincón serrano parece resistirse al paso del tiempo. La Carolina está ubicada a los pies del Cerro Tomolasta, dentro del departamento Coronel Pringles. Su historia está marcada por la fiebre del oro, que dejó huellas visibles en sus túneles, casas de piedra y hasta en el alma tranquila de sus habitantes.
Con menos de 300 personas viviendo allí, el pueblo ofrece una combinación única de tranquilidad, aventura y cultura. Es una propuesta ideal para quienes buscan desconectarse de la ciudad y reconectar con la naturaleza, especialmente durante un fin de semana largo como el de Semana Santa.
¿Qué hacer en La Carolina durante el finde XXL?
Uno de los grandes atractivos del pueblo es la posibilidad de vivir la experiencia minera de cerca. Se puede participar de visitas guiadas por antiguas galerías subterráneas, conocer cómo se extraía el oro en el pasado y hasta intentar un poco de ""bateo"" artesanal. La experiencia es tan educativa como entretenida.
A 20 kilómetros, la Gruta de Inti Huasi suma un toque de arqueología y misterio. Este refugio natural es uno de los sitios más antiguos del país con restos humanos y herramientas que datan de hace más de 8.000 años. Ideal para sumar una salida con contenido histórico y paisajístico en un solo paseo.
Para los amantes del aire libre, hay senderos de trekking al Cerro Tomolasta, paseos a caballo y pesca en el Río Grande. Las vistas panorámicas, los caminos sin asfalto y el silencio del lugar son parte de su encanto. Durante Semana Santa, el pueblo suele volverse peatonal, ideal para recorrerlo con calma entre puestos de artesanías, casas coloniales y sabores regionales.
¿Cómo llegar desde Buenos Aires?
El recorrido en auto desde la capital federal puede llevar unas diez horas, pero vale la pena. El trayecto incluye la Ruta Nacional 8 hasta Colón, luego se continúa por la Ruta 50, se conecta con la Ruta Nacional 7 y se finaliza por la Ruta Provincial 9 hasta llegar a destino. La travesía, lejos de ser una molestia, forma parte de la desconexión que muchos buscan.
Una escapada distinta para Semana Santa
En una época donde los viajeros buscan experiencias auténticas, La Carolina aparece como un destino perfecto: lejos del bullicio, con historia viva bajo la tierra, paisajes serranos y una paz que no se compra. Ideal para una pausa real, en un feriado que invita a reflexionar y reconectarse con lo esencial.

Insights
Synovus delivered exceptional Q1 results with 67% EPS growth, driven by margin expansion and credit improvement despite growing economic caution.
Synovus Financial Corp. (NYSE: SNV) has posted remarkably strong first quarter results, with diluted earnings per share of $1.30, representing a 67% year-over-year increase from $0.78 in Q1 2024. This substantial growth was primarily driven by three key factors: net interest margin expansion of 31 basis points year-over-year to 3.35%, a significantly reduced provision for credit losses of $10.9 million (down 80% from $54 million last year), and disciplined expense management.
The bank's net interest income increased 8% year-over-year to $454.4 million, demonstrating the effectiveness of its deposit repricing strategies in the current rate environment. Despite a flat sequential loan growth of just $39.7 million, the improved funding costs and NIM expansion have substantially boosted profitability metrics, with return on average tangible common equity reaching 17.52% compared to 11.71% a year ago.
Credit quality metrics show remarkable improvement. The non-performing loan ratio decreased to 0.67% from 0.86% a year ago, while the net charge-off ratio fell to 0.20% from 0.41% in Q1 2024. The allowance for credit losses stands at 1.24% of loans with a robust 185% coverage of non-performing loans.
Of particular note is the bank's effective capital management, maintaining a strong preliminary CET1 ratio of 10.75% even after repurchasing $120 million in common stock during the quarter. This demonstrates confidence in their capital position despite economic uncertainties.
Management's commentary suggests growing caution among borrowers and investors concerning consumer spending sustainability, potential tariff impacts, and federal government layoffs. However, these highlighted risks appear to be more forward-looking than immediate, as current performance metrics remain exceptionally strong across the board.
Synovus demonstrates banking sector resilience with superior margin management, credit improvement, and capital deployment while navigating economic uncertainty.
Synovus's Q1 performance represents a textbook example of effective banking management in a challenging interest rate environment. The 31 basis point year-over-year expansion in net interest margin to 3.35% is particularly impressive when many regional banks are still struggling with margin compression. This improvement stems from successful deposit repricing strategies, with average deposit costs declining 20 basis points sequentially to 2.26%, demonstrating the bank's pricing power and customer retention capability.
The deposit mix evolution reveals important trends: non-interest-bearing deposits declined 4% year-over-year to $11.1 billion, reflecting the broader industry challenge of deposit migration. However, Synovus has effectively offset this by growing interest-bearing DDA accounts by 12% and money market accounts by 7%. The bank has also reduced its reliance on brokered deposits by 15% year-over-year, a positive sign for funding stability.
The dramatic improvement in credit metrics is particularly noteworthy. The 80% reduction in provision expense to just $10.9 million signals strong confidence in the loan portfolio quality, while the decline in non-performing assets to 0.67% places Synovus among the stronger performers in the regional banking space. The sequential improvement in these metrics contradicts the cautionary economic outlook mentioned by management.
Capital deployment actions, including $120 million in share repurchases while maintaining a 10.75% CET1 ratio, demonstrate management's confidence in the bank's financial health and future prospects. This balanced approach to shareholder returns and capital preservation distinguishes Synovus from more cautious regional banking peers.
Management's comments about borrowers and investors growing ""more cautious amid concerns surrounding the sustainability of consumer spending and potential impacts from higher tariffs and federal government layoffs"" warrant attention, but haven't yet materialized in the bank's performance metrics, which show across-the-board improvement.

Forward-Looking Statements
This press release and certain of our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission contain statements that constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of, and subject to the protections of, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. All statements other than statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements. You can identify these forward-looking statements through Synovus’ use of words such as “believes,” “anticipates,” “expects,” “may,” “will,” “assumes,” “should,” “predicts,” “could,” “would,” “intends,” “targets,” “estimates,” “projects,” “plans,” “potential” and other similar words and expressions of the future or otherwise regarding the outlook for Synovus’ future business and financial performance and/or the performance of the banking industry and economy in general. These forward-looking statements include, among others, our expectations regarding our future operating and financial performance; expectations on our growth strategy, expense and revenue initiatives, capital management, balance sheet management, and future profitability; expectations on credit quality and performance; and the assumptions underlying our expectations. Prospective investors are cautioned that any such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties which may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of Synovus to be materially different from the future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are based on the information known to, and current beliefs and expectations of, Synovus’ management and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by such forward-looking statements. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements in this press release. Many of these factors are beyond Synovus’ ability to control or predict.
These forward-looking statements are based upon information presently known to Synovus’ management and are inherently subjective, uncertain and subject to change due to any number of risks and uncertainties, including, without limitation, the risks and other factors set forth in Synovus’ filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended Dec. 31, 2024, under the captions “Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors” and in Synovus’ quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. We believe these forward-looking statements are reasonable; however, undue reliance should not be placed on any forward-looking statements, which are based on current expectations and speak only as of the date that they are made. We do not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, except as otherwise may be required by law.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The measures entitled adjusted non-interest revenue, non-interest expense; adjusted revenue taxable equivalent (TE); adjusted tangible efficiency ratio; adjusted pre-provision net revenue (PPNR); adjusted return on average assets; adjusted net income available to common shareholders; adjusted diluted earnings per share; adjusted return on average common equity; return on average tangible common equity; adjusted return on average tangible common equity; and tangible common equity ratio are not measures recognized under GAAP and therefore are considered non-GAAP financial measures. The most comparable GAAP measures to these measures are total non-interest revenue; total non-interest expense; total revenue; efficiency ratio-TE; PPNR; return on average assets; net income available to common shareholders; diluted earnings per share; return on average common equity; and the ratio of total Synovus Financial Corp. shareholders' equity to total assets, respectively.
Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful additional information about Synovus to assist management and investors in evaluating Synovus’ operating results, financial strength, the performance of its business, and the strength of its capital position. However, these non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analyses of operating results or capital position as reported under GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures should be considered as additional views of the way our financial measures are affected by significant items and other factors, and since they are not required to be uniformly applied, they may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures at other companies. Adjusted non-interest revenue and adjusted revenue (TE) are measures used by management to evaluate non-interest revenue and total revenue exclusive of net investment securities gains (losses), fair value adjustments on non-qualified deferred compensation and other items not indicative of ongoing operations that could impact period-to-period comparisons. Adjusted non-interest expense and the adjusted tangible efficiency ratio are measures utilized by management to measure the success of expense management initiatives focused on reducing recurring controllable operating costs. Adjusted net income available to common shareholders, adjusted diluted earnings per share, adjusted return on average assets, and adjusted return on average common equity are measures used by management to evaluate operating results exclusive of items that are not indicative of ongoing operations and impact period-to-period comparisons. Return on average tangible common equity and adjusted return on average tangible common equity are measures used by management to compare Synovus’ performance with other financial institutions because it calculates the return available to common shareholders without the impact of intangible assets and their related amortization, thereby allowing management to evaluate the performance of the business consistently. Adjusted PPNR is used by management to evaluate PPNR exclusive of items that management believes are not indicative of ongoing operations and impact period-to-period comparisons. The tangible common equity ratio is used by stakeholders to assess our capital position. The computations of these measures are set forth in the tables below.

I consulenti dei CDC statunitensi raccomandano di abbassare l'età per la vaccinazione contro l'RSV a 50-59 anni - Notizie TradingView,"I consulenti dei CDC statunitensi raccomandano di abbassare l'età per la vaccinazione contro l'RSV a 50-59 anni
- Il voto è stato di 14-0 a favore delle nuove linee guida
- La precedente raccomandazione riguardava gli adulti di 75 anni e più e gli adulti a rischio di età compresa tra i 60 e i 74 anni
- Il gruppo di esperti prenderà in considerazione il vaccino contro l'RSV per gli adulti sotto i 50 anni a giugno
- Il gruppo di esperti raccomanda anche il vaccino meningococcico GSK
Il gruppo di esperti esterni dei Centri statunitensi per il controllo e la prevenzione delle malattie ha raccomandato mercoledì l'uso di vaccini contro il virus respiratorio sinciziale negli adulti più giovani che sono a maggior rischio di malattie gravi causate dal virus.
Il gruppo di 15 membri ha votato 14 a 0 per raccomandare che gli adulti a rischio di età compresa tra 50 e 59 anni ricevano una singola dose di vaccino RSV. Uno dei membri del gruppo si è astenuto dal voto.
Attualmente il CDC raccomanda il vaccino per gli adulti di età rivale o superiore a 75 anni e per gli adulti a rischio di età compresa tra 60 e 74 anni.
""Ciò che mi convince è che ci sono chiaramente persone nella fascia di età compresa tra i 50 e i 59 anni, ad esempio i pazienti sottoposti a trapianto polmonare,... che beneficerebbero chiaramente dell'accesso a questo vaccino"", ha detto Jane Zucker, uno dei membri votanti del gruppo di esperti, prima della votazione.
Se la raccomandazione venisse adottata dal CDC, circa il 30% degli adulti statunitensi di questa fascia d'età avrebbe diritto al vaccino contro l'RSV, secondo il relatore Michael Melgar.
Gli esperti esterni di vaccini hanno anche chiesto maggiori dati sulla durata dei benefici del vaccino e sulla tempistica della rivaccinazione.
""Sono un grande sostenitore dell'abbassamento dell'età e del fatto che il vaccino sia il più semplice possibile... e che la base di rischio sia stata mantenuta così ampia"", ha detto Jason Goldman, membro non votante del panel.
L'RSV causa tipicamente sintomi simili al raffreddore, ma è anche una delle principali cause di polmonite nei bambini e negli adulti più anziani. Secondo le stime del CDC, ogni anno negli Stati Uniti si verificano 15.000-20.000 ricoveri per RSV negli adulti di età compresa tra i 50 e i 59 anni.
Il direttore del CDC di solito approva le raccomandazioni del gruppo di esperti prima che vengano attuate, ma attualmente l'agenzia non ne ha uno. (link) La nomina di Susan Monarez , designata dal presidente Donald Trump per questo incarico, non è ancora stata confermata dal Senato degli Stati Uniti.
La Food and Drug Administration statunitense ha approvato tre vaccini contro l'RSV: Arexvy di GSK GSK, mRESVIA di Moderna MRNA e Abrysvo di Pfizer PFE.
Arexvy e Abrysvo sono approvati per prevenire la malattia delle basse vie respiratorie associata all'RSV negli adulti di età compresa rispettivamente tra i 50 e i 59 anni e tra i 18 e i 59 anni, che presentano un rischio maggiore di contrarre la malattia.

PROTESTERS HOLDING PHOTOS OF GAZAN JOURNALISTS AND CHANTINGPARIS, FRANCE - APR. 16, 2025: Journalists from across France gathered in Paris on Wednesday, Apr. 16, to show support for their Palestinian colleagues in Gaza, where Israeli attacks have continued for months. Hundreds of journalists from various media organizations assembled at Bastille Square, staging a symbolic protest on the steps of the opera house to raise awareness of the plight of media workers in the besieged enclave. Wearing white vests marked ""PRESS"" with red stains symbolizing blood, the demonstrators carried photos of Palestinian journalists who lost their lives during the ongoing Israeli offensive. Banners reading “Stop the massacre of journalists, solidarity with our colleagues” were displayed throughout the protest. At least 211 Palestinian journalists have been killed in Israeli attacks in the Gaza Strip since October 2023, according to local authorities. The Israeli army renewed a deadly assault on Gaza on March 18, shattering a ceasefire and prisoner exchange agreement that took hold in January. More than 51,000 Palestinians, most of them women and children, have been killed in Gaza in a brutal Israeli onslaught since October 2023. The International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants last November for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant for war crimes and crimes against humanity in Gaza. Israel also faces a genocide case at the International Court of Justice for its war on the enclave. Reporting by Esra Taskin // Writing by Mustafa Tuncer

Surrey health-care workers demand immigration justice,"Surrey health-care workers demand immigration justice
Posted April 16, 2025 2:13 pm.
Last Updated April 16, 2025 2:19 pm.
Health-care workers will hold a rally in Surrey on Thursday to protest federal cuts to an immigration policy that threaten their path to permanent residency.
On Tuesday, the B.C. government said the odds of new applications from immigrants looking to be accepted into its Provincial Nominee Program (PNP) this year have dropped to near zero for anyone other than health workers or entrepreneurs after the federal government slashed the number of available slots.
A bulletin from the province says it was only allotted 4,000 nominations this year, about half of what it had last year and substantially less than the 11,000 it wanted.
It says the program, which helps immigrants already living in Canada gain permanent residency if they fill key jobs, will accept 1,100 new applications this year, mainly for doctors, nurses, and other health professionals, as well as entrepreneurs.
Thursday’s protest aims to pressure the government on restoring PNP spots for housekeepers, dietary aides, relational security officers, and many more health-care workers—people who rely on the immigration policy for a permanent, fair pathway to permanent residency.
The Hospital Employees’ Union (HEU) argues that B.C. can not afford to lose these essential health-care workers since the province is already struggling with health-care staffing shortages.
The union also stresses that the people affected by the PNP cuts are essential health-care workers with hard-to-fill jobs.
HEU, which has more than 60,000 members in the province, says the protest will be held at King George Boulevard and will not disrupt hospital operations.
The rally is scheduled for 11 a.m. on Thursday.",2025-04-17T00:13:00.000+03:00,https://vancouver.citynews.ca/2025/04/16/surrey-health-care-workers-demand-immigration-justice-protest-pnp-cuts,Jan Schuermann,positive
Kyle City Council approves water supply lease agreement,"AUSTIN, Texas — The Kyle City Council has approved a resolution to authorize a regional water supply lease agreement with the Green Valley Special Utility District (GVSUD).
At a special meeting held on March 29, the city council agreed to lease 0.652 million gallons of water per day (MGDs) annually from the GVSUD from its share of the Alliance Water Phase 1B water supply.
After Alliance Water’s Phase 1C and 1D are completed, the lease will increase to a total volume of 1.42 MGDs per year.
The city of Kyle will be responsible for monthly fixed and variable charges in the lease agreement, including costs for operations, maintenance and special assessments in the water supply. The agreement also marks an initial two-year term with automatic one-year renewals.
According to estimates from the city, the total costs for the next three fiscal years are expected to equal:
- $425,430 in 2025
- $591,347.88 in 2026
- $498,982,48 in 2027
""This lease is a critical step in ensuring a sustainable water supply for both present and future residents of Kyle, helping us remain resilient during prolonged drought conditions,” Kyle Water Utilities Director Mike Murphy said in a news release sent on Wednesday. ""It’s a clear example of how the city council is committed to effectively managing our resources to meet the evolving needs of our community.""
“The partnership between Green Valley SUD and the city of Kyle is a strong example of collaboration and forward-thinking among our member entities,” Alliance Water Executive Director Graham Moore said. ""Alliance Water is proud to support this effort and looks forward to the upcoming water delivery to Kyle as we continue to build upon the city’s water supply.""

Attorney General Knudsen files brief supporting President Trump's actions to bring education authority back to,"Attorney General Knudsen files brief supporting President Trump’s actions to bring education authority back to the states
HELENA – Montana Attorney General Austin Knudsen led a coalition of 21 states in supporting President Donald J. Trump’s reduction in force (RIF) at the Department of Education, which will ultimately return more authority to state education departments.
The amicus brief was filed on Monday in the case State of New York v. Secretary Linda McMahon. Last month, the Department of Education announced a nearly 50 percent RIF to improve efficiency and better allocate resources to serve students, parents, and teachers across the country. Shortly after, the plaintiffs, 21 Democrat states, sued the Trump Administration. However, Article II of the Constitution gives President Trump the authority to manage Executive Branch employees as he sees fit.
“Article II provides the President with broad authority to manage the federal workforce. The Founders confirmed this authority, and the courts have recognized it for more than two centuries except in limited circumstances not relevant here,” Attorney General Knudsen wrote. “Restricting the President’s ability to place administrative employees on leave or implement reductions in force will cripple both the President and the ability to ensure good government.”
The attorneys general note in their brief that the plaintiffs are not likely to succeed on the merits of the case as the separation of powers supports President Trump’s authority under Article II of the Constitution. Article II grants authority to the Executive Branch to manage the Department of Education’s workforce, which is a critical power and responsibility of the President.
Plaintiffs have also failed to show irreparable harm. For example, plaintiffs allege they will suffer irreparable harm by not receiving guidance from the Department. However, President Trump and the Department recently provided important Title IX guidance that women and girls must be provided fair athletic opportunities under Title IX, but several plaintiff states refused to comply. Plaintiffs cannot claim to rely on guidance they are rejecting.
“Plaintiffs cannot demand reinstatement of employees to provide ‘essential’ guidance upon which they claim to rely, while they are rejecting the essential guidance that is provided,” Attorney General Knudsen wrote.
Finally, while the plaintiffs will not suffer irreparable harm without an injunction, the Trump Administration will suffer irreparable harm with an injunction since the President would be unable to exercise his Article II powers. Additionally, public interest supports the President’s actions as they “will empower states to deliver unprecedented opportunity for every child, regardless of household income or where a child lives.”
Attorneys general from Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, Ohio, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, and West Virginia also joined the brief.

Suecia y Alcaldía de Tarija ponen en funcionamiento moderna planta de tratamiento de aguas industriales,"Suecia y Alcaldía de Tarija ponen en funcionamiento moderna planta de tratamiento de aguas industriales
El gobierno de Suecia y la Alcaldía de la ciudad de Tarija inauguraron este miércoles una moderna planta de tratamiento de aguas residuales y residuos sólidos orgánicos en el Matadero Municipal
El gobierno de Suecia y la Alcaldía de la ciudad de Tarija inauguraron este miércoles una moderna planta de tratamiento de aguas residuales y residuos sólidos orgánicos en el Matadero Municipal.
Inidacron que, con este proyectoc se busca frenar la contaminación del río Guadalquivir con desechos orgánicos desde hace 40 años.
La planta de tratamiento de aguas industriales y residuos sólidos tiene un costo total de $us 2.4 millones (Bs 17 millones) asumido en contrapartes por ambas instituciones.
Suecia, a través de la Fundación Aguatuya, financió la primera planta de su tipo y marcó un hito en la gestión sostenible de aguas y residuos de mataderos en Bolivia.
Según datos proporcionados, tiene una capacidad instalada para procesar 150 metros cúbicos por día en el Matadero Municipal, entidad descentralizada de la Alcaldía Municipal de la ciudad de Tarija.
Mientras los residuos orgánicos, como el rumen, sangre y estiércol serán aprovechados para generar abono, a través de un proceso de compostaje, destinado a la producción agrícola.
""Es decir, cuando el Matadero pueda faenar 150 cabezas de reses va llegar a esa capacidad máxima de 150 mil litros. El agua tratada se podrá usar para el riego en áreas verdes"", explicó Renato Montoya, director de la Fundación Aguatuya.
Montoya afirmó que en la planta de tratamiento de aguas industriales y residuos sólidos orgánicos se incorporaron sistemas de tecnología de España, Austria y Alemania.
Teresa Bjorklund, oficial de programas de la Embajada de Suecia, dijo que este proyecto que se puso en funcionamiento marca un antes y después debido a que las aguas del Matadero Municipal eran evacuadas sin tratamiento adecuado al río Guadalquivir.
Agregó que la delegación sueca tiene como perspectiva implementar similar planta en otros municipios de Bolivia.
El alcalde Johnny Torres señaló que Tarija tiene ahora una planta moderna y única en el país que podrá durar unos 50 años por la calidad del material con el que fue construido.",2025-04-17T00:11:00.000+03:00,https://www.eldeber.com.bo/pais/suecia-y-alcaldia-de-tarija-ponen-en-funcionamiento-moderna-planta-de-tratamiento-de-aguas-industriales_510850,David Maygua,positive

Como una ""jornada electoral pacífica, ordenada y democrática"", así destacó el Gobierno ecuatoriano, a través de la Cancillería, a la jornada electoral que terminó en la reelección de Daniel Noboa como presidente para los próximos años.
El comunicado llegó después que los presidentes de Colombia, Gustavo Petro; de México, Claudia Sheinbaum, hasta Nicolás Maduro, quien se mantiene en el poder en Venezuela acusado de fraude electoral, sembraran dudas sobre los comicios del 13 de abril en Ecuador.
Los mandatarios de esos países se hicieron eco de las acusaciones de fraude, sin pruebas, lanzadas por la excandidata presidencial de la Revolución Ciudadana, Luisa González, y su mentor, Rafael Correa, sobre la segunda vuelta electoral.
En el comunicado, el Gobierno ""saluda el trabajo realizado por las misiones de observación electoral de la Organización de Estados Americanos (OEA) y de la Unión Europea (UE) que da cuenta de la jornada electoral efectuada el 13 de abril de forma transparente y que reafirma la vocación democrática del pueblo ecuatoriano"".
""Al expresar su confianza en los resultados oficiales presentados por el Consejo Nacional Electoral (CNE), ambas misiones desmienten las narrativas de fraude, al constatar la coincidencia de la información compilada por los observadores con los datos arrojados por el sistema informático de escrutinios y resultados del CNE"", señala.
A diferencia de Petro, Sheinbaum y Maduro, otros presidentes como Donald Trump, de Estados Unidos, Emmanuel Macron, de Francia; Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, de Brasil; Gabriel Boric, entre otros, han enviado mensajes de felicitación a Noboa por su reelección para el periodo 2025-2029.
De allí que en el comunicado, el Gobierno del Ecuador también ""manifiesta su aprecio por las numerosas felicitaciones emitidas por jefes y jefas de Estado y de Gobierno y otras autoridades extranjeras, en reconocimiento de la decisión adoptada por el pueblo ecuatoriano"".

Lincoln mayor recognizes 911 dispatchers,"Lincoln mayor recognizes 911 dispatchers for National Public Safety Telecommunicators Week
In honor of National Public Safety Telecommunicators Week, Lincoln Mayor Lierion Gaylor Baird called their 911 dispatchers superheroes during a proclamation on Wednesday morning.
Lincoln's 911 center answers over half a million calls a year.
Their professionalism provides a key line to first responders.
That is critical in major events like last year's Arbor Day tornado.
""The gravity of that event impacted industry, it impacted lives, it impacted people just trying to do their day-to-day. Those natural weather events can be horrific. But the response of this team. They didn't miss a beat,"" Jessica Loos, Lincoln Emergency Communications Center director, said.
Their job has been even more challenging with nationwide staff shortages.
Lincoln's 911 center is currently down 14 positions.

Foreigners are still coming to Russia. After visiting the country, some choose Russia as their permanent place of residence. One such example is the American Pichoni family. Eric, the head of the family, shared his impressions of life in Russia on his YouTube channel.
He acknowledged that there is less support for children in the United States. In Russia, he said, ""there are very good conditions for raising children."" Eric Pichoni said that American insurance is very small and covers a small part of expenses, for example, for visiting a doctor with a child. Medicine, he says, cost thousands of dollars a month.
""I have a little daughter, she is two and a half years old.

The Brief Dallas Mavericks CEO Rick Welts spoke about the efforts to build a new arena for the team. The team's lease at the AAC comes to an end in 2031. Welts says the team is looking for options in Dallas before looking in other parts of the Metroplex. DALLAS - Dallas Mavericks CEO Rick Welts and general manager Nico Harrison answered questions from reporters on Tuesday.
While much of the meeting focused on the Luka Dončić trade , Welts also spoke about the efforts to build a new arena.
There has been a great deal of speculation around the team's next location when the Mavs' lease at the American Airlines Center comes to an end in 2031.

Expand Welts told reporters he believes the team's efforts to build a ""new arena entertainment district"" has been overshadowed by other turmoil among the team.
The CEO says the team has been in discussions with the city of Dallas to find a suitable 30 to 50 acres of land to build the arena.
A company connected to Las Vegas Sands, which is run by Mavericks governor Patrick Dumont, owns a plot of land in Irving. The Texas Stadium site has been widely considered to be a possible location for a new arena.
Welts said the team is looking for a solution in Dallas before looking other places in the Metroplex.
""I think the progress we've made to date makes me very encouraged that you know, ultimately, you know, we're going to find that location within the boundaries of the city of Dallas,"" he said.

article Dallas Mavericks, Nico Harrison double down on Luka Dončić trade to Lakers Dallas Mavericks General Manager Nico Harrison met with reporters for the first just the second time since orchestrating the deal to trade superstar Luka Doncic. He said stands by his unpopular decision and has no regrests.
The team's goal is to have the new arena open for the 2031-2032 season.
The arena would also host events like concerts.
Gambling legislation's impact on Dallas Mavericks' new arena Irving approves development without casino, nightclub In the early morning hours, the Irving City Council gave approval for Las Vegas Sands to move forward with a development but without a casino and nightclub. The move came after Sands removed its request for gaming in the 11th hour. FOX 4's Lori Brown reports on what's next.
The Mavericks' owners, the Adelson and Dumont families, have deep connections to the casino industry.
Las Vegas Sands has proposed a resort and casino attached to an arena in the past, but gambling appears unlikely to pass the Texas Legislature in the near future.
Welts says the plans for the arena will not depend on changes to the current laws.
""We're full speed ahead, with or without any legislation that permits casino gambling in Texas. So we're going to build absolutely the best facility for the Mavericks going forward. That's the focus, not dependent whatsoever on casino gambling in Texas,"" said Welts.

Expand Welts said the team will work with the Stars to improve the American Airlines Center for the time they remain in the building, but seemed to be intrigued by a basketball-only facility.
""There's some real advantages for basketball fans. If you design a basketball-only facility, you're not working around the larger geometry of a hockey rink versus a smaller floor footprint of a basketball court. So, at least at this point, we think the best option for the Mavericks right now, and for the experience of going to Mavericks games, would be to build a basketball-first facility,"" he said.

"Petro promete dar asilo a los opositores ""perseguidos"" en este país","Petro promete dar asilo a los opositores ""perseguidos"" en este país
Según la Internacional Progresista, estos políticos ecuatorianos, entre los que se encuentra la excandidata Luisa González y la vicepresidenta, Verónica Abad, corren el riesgo se ser detenidos.
El Gobierno de Colombia anunció que dará asilo a los opositores ecuatorianos que lleguen al país vecino, tras el proceso electoral realizado en Ecuador, donde fue reelegido el presidente Daniel Noboa, entre señalamientos de fraude de la que fuera candidata opositora, Luisa González.
La afirmación la hizo el presidente colombiano, Gustavo Petro, quien publicó en su cuenta de X que ""hay una lista negra de opositores en Ecuador que están siendo perseguidos"", por lo que tomó la determinación de recibirlo, en calidad de asilados, en su país.
Petro también denunció, sin dar más detalle, que ""han sido detenidos observadores electorales colombianos"".
El mandatario comentó una interacción de la Internacional Progresista donde se adjunta una ""lista negra"" con ""figuras de la oposición que corren el máximo riesgo de ser detenidas"".
El escrito supuestamente habría sido hecho por la Administración del reelecto Noboa. Entre los nombres que figuran se encuentra los de González, quien sostiene que los resultados de los comicios fueron fraudulentos, y de la vicepresidenta, Verónica Abad, cuyos derechos políticos están suspendidos en medio de una disputa que mantiene con su otrora compañero de fórmula.
Otra reacciones adversas para Noboa
En esta jornada, la presidenta de México, Claudia Sheinbaum, manifestó que su país no reanudará las relaciones con Ecuador mientras Noboa esté al frente del Gobierno y calificó de ""dudoso"" su triunfo.
Por su parte, el mandatario venezolano, Nicolás Maduro, responsabilizó a una ONG venezolana, dirigida por la opositora María Corina Machado, y a EE.UU., de haber llevado a cabo el ""fraude"" en Ecuador.
Del mismo modo, la Organización de Estados Americanos (OEA), a través su Misión de Observación Electoral, aseguró que ""observó con preocupación que el proceso electoral estuvo marcado por condiciones de inequidad durante la campaña, así como por indicios sobre el uso indebido de recursos públicos y del aparato estatal con fines proselitistas"".",2025-04-17T00:28:00.000+03:00,https://spanish.news-pravda.com/world/2025/04/16/404734.html,,positive

The renewal's strategic value extends beyond simple square footage. One Grand Central Place's direct access to Grand Central Terminal's transportation hub has become a crucial competitive advantage in the post-pandemic landscape where commuting convenience significantly influences tenant decisions. This amenity, combined with the building's 55 stories of modernized office space, creates a compelling value proposition for tenants like GLG seeking premium headquarters locations.
For investors, this renewal signals stability in ESRT's Manhattan portfolio and demonstrates the REIT's ability to execute its tenant retention strategy. While the financial terms and lease duration weren't disclosed, renewals typically involve lower capital expenditures than new tenant acquisitions, avoiding costs associated with extended vacancy periods, new tenant improvements, and leasing commissions.
GLG's renewal also validates ESRT's emphasis on sustainability leadership and building modernization – factors increasingly important to corporate tenants with ESG commitments. The retention of this financial and global information services firm suggests ESRT's properties remain competitive in attracting and retaining high-value tenants despite market headwinds facing office REITs.
Empire State Realty Trust, Inc. (NYSE: ESRT) announced today that it signed a 77,382 square foot renewal lease with Gerson Lehrman Group, Inc. (GLG) – a financial and global information services consulting company – at One Grand Central Place. GLG joined the ESRT portfolio in 2013 and now occupies two full floors overlooking Vanderbilt Plaza.
""One Grand Central Place's unmatched location and office environment have created an ideal headquarters for GLG to convene the world’s leading experts and clients,"" said Gemma Postlethwaite, CEO at GLG. ""We are pleased to continue our long-term partnership with ESRT and see our company continue to grow and thrive at OGCP.""
One Grand Central Place features 55 stories of modernized, amenitized office space near New York City’s best restaurants, lodging, and entertainment. The building offers unmatched transportation options with convenient in-building access to Grand Central Terminal’s commuter trains, five subway lines, and Grand Central Madison access to the LIRR.
""Tenants understand the value of ESRT’s unmatched locations, amenities, exceptional service, best-in-class balance sheet, sustainability leadership, and modernized office spaces,” said ESRT’s EVP, Real Estate Thomas P. Durels. “We are pleased to continue our partnership with GLG as they renew their office space at One Grand Central Place.”
TJ Hochanadel, Robert Martin, Dan Santagata, and Paul Kauffman of JLL represented GLG in the lease negotiations. Jordan Berger, Shanae Ursini, and Kerry Lavelle of ESRT and Scott Klau, William Cohen, Erik Harris, and Neil Rubin of Newmark represented the property owner.

"Putin meets with Russians freed by Hamas, expresses gratitude for 'humanitarian act'","On Wednesday, Vladimir Putin met with several Russian citizens who had been freed from captivity by Hamas. The president welcomed to the Kremlin Alexander Trufanov — released by Hamas on February 15, 2025 — along with his mother Elena Trufanova and fiancée Sapir Cohen, who were freed in late 2023. Also present at the meeting were Russia’s chief rabbi, Berel Lazar, and the president of the Federation of Jewish Communities of Russia, Alexander Boroda.
During the meeting, Putin thanked Hamas for releasing the hostages. “We must express our gratitude to the leadership and political wing of Hamas for cooperating with us and carrying out this humanitarian act,” he said, adding that Russia would “do everything possible to ensure such acts take place more often.”
Twenty-nine-year-old Alexander Trufanov, a dual citizen of Israel and Russia, was abducted from the Nir Oz kibbutz during Hamas’s attack on Israel on October 7, 2023. While being abducted, Trufanov was shot in both his legs. He and two other Israeli citizens were released on February 15 as part of a deal between Hamas and Israel.
In mid-January, Israel and Hamas reached an agreement on a temporary ceasefire and the release of 33 Israeli hostages in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. Attempts to extend the agreement failed, and Israel resumed military operations in the Gaza Strip on March 18. Hamas is still holding 59 Israeli hostages. According to the Israel Defense Forces, at least 35 of them are confirmed dead.
Hamas militants killed more than 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took some 250 people into captivity in Gaza in October 2023. In March 2025, Palestinian health authorities said Israel’s ground and air campaign had killed more than 50,000 people, with nearly a third of the dead under the age of 18. Two months earlier, a peer-reviewed statistical analysis published in The Lancet journal concluded that the official Palestinian tally of direct deaths likely undercounted the number of casualties by around 40 percent in the first nine months of the war.",2025-04-17T00:18:00.000+03:00,https://meduza.io/en/news/2025/04/17/putin-meets-with-russians-freed-by-hamas-expresses-gratitude-for-humanitarian-act,Meduza,positive

North Carolina Attorney General launches initiative protect Helene survivors from contractor fraud,"North Carolina Attorney General launches initiative protect Helene survivors from contractor fraud
Safe to Rebuild initiative serves as a warning to would-be criminals
CHARLOTTE, N.C. (WBTV) - Law enforcement from across the High Country is teaming up with the state bureau of investigation and North Carolina Attorney General to protect people in the wake of Hurricane Helene.
Six months after the storm, they are now preparing for an uptick in bad actors posing as people trying to help survivors.
“We anticipate that may increase.. due to the building season coming on,” Avery County Sheriff Mike Henley said. “So you know, our objective is just to get ahead of this.”
North Carolina Attorney General Jeff Jackson said western North Carolina is entering a new phase in the aftermath of Helene.
“In the immediate aftermath of Helene, it was the recovery phase,” Jackson said. “We were worried mainly about price gouging. Now we’re out of that and more into the rebuilding phase. A lot of the rebuilding is going to be done by unlicensed contractors. Demand for their services is going to be very high. We’re glad that contractors are coming to Western, North Carolina, but we need them to know that if they treat people dishonestly, if they take advantage of people, they will be held accountable.”
In addition to warning potential criminals, the Attorney General’s office recommends consumers do the following:
- Get written estimates and comparing bids.
- Get a written contract.
- Protect your payment. Never pay for most or all of the work before it’s completed and do not pay in cash.
“If folks do literally no work, that’s actually a crime in North Carolina,” Jackson said. “Those contractors can face criminal consequences. A lot of them do partial work, and then it’s a question of, well, did you do the work that you said you were going to do?”
Jackson says a top priority for himself as attorney general is to educate the public about the power of filing reports to his office.
“It doesn’t have to be a lot of complaints,” he said. “If there’s one highly detailed complaint, we will use that as the basis for an investigation.”
He says if a business does not respond to his office, they can escalate it.

'He's home!': Family of rescued US pastor after SA kidnapping,"Family and friends of US pastor Josh Sullivan are celebrating his safe rescue by police after he was kidnapped and held hostage for ransom from his Gqerberha church last week.
The 45-year-old and his family have been living in South Africa since 2018 after establishing a church in the Eastern Cape.
US PASTOR RESCUED, KIDNAPPERS KILLED Less than a week after his kidnapping in church mid-sermon, Josh Sullivan was rescued by police from a KwaMagxaki property in Nelson Mandela Bay.
On Tuesday, 15 April, The dramatic “high stakes” rescue saw police shoot and kill three suspects who held the US pastor for ransom.
According to Hawks spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Avele Fumba, a special task team acted on verified intelligence into the missing man’s whereabouts.
Fumba claimed that the suspects had attempted to flee the scene and had opened fire on police.
“The officers responded with tactical precision, leading to a high-intensity shoot-out in which three unidentified suspects were fatally wounded.”
The US pastor was found “miraculously unharmed” in the house and was treated by medical personnel. He is in “good health”.
FAMILY, FRIENDS CELEBRATE GOOD NEWS Celebrating his safe return, Josh Sullivan’s family and friends have shared their joy on Facebook.
Tonya Morton Rinker – the mother of the US pastor – posted: “HE’S HOME, My Baby is free! Joshua was rescued earlier today! He is home with Meagan and the kids. PRAISE GOD FOR HIS GRACE AND MERCY. Praise The Lord Jesus Christ!”
Of reports that three suspects had been killed in a police shoot-out, she added in another post: “A sad situation. But I’m so thankful my son is home alive and safe”.
Others, both in the US and SA, also stated that the pastor’s safe rescue was nothing short of a “miracle.”

Acciones argentinas ganaron hasta 3% en dólares tras el desembolso del FMI - El Cronista,"Acciones argentinas ganaron hasta 3% en dólares tras el desembolso del FMI
Ante las señales clavse para el mercado que buscó dar el Gobierno en los últimos días, con el fin del cepo y la llegada de un fuerte desembolso del FMI, las acciones treparon en Wall Street.
Pese a la tendencia negativa en los mercados globales, los activos argentinos continuaron mostrando fortaleza tras el desembolso de u$s 12.000 del Fondo Monetario Internacional (FMI) y el aporte de u$s 1500 millones del Banco Mundial.
La principal razón del pesimismo global fue la noticia de Nvidia, que anunció que tendrá pérdidas millonarias por el aumento de los aranceles a las importaciones en EEUU.
""Las empresas ven que van a tener menos ganancias en el marco de la guerra comercial que desató Donald Trump. Esto disparó un risk off a nivel mundial, que redunda en menos inversores, menos interés en las acciones y una caída en el valors"", dice a El Cronista el analista Eric Paniagua, de Epyca Consultores.
Se refiere al anuncio de Nvidia, que informó que perderá cerca de u$s 5000 millones por los aranceles de Trump y eso hizo que muchas empresas sinceraran que van a perder mucho dinero. ""Las acciones argentinas no escapan la debacle global y caen también"", asegura Paniagua.
Sin embargo, los ADR de empresas argentinas tuvieron una jornada positiva en Wall Street. Edenor encabezó las subas, con una ganancia de 3,5%. Fue seguida por Cresud, YPF y Banco Supervielle, que treparon 3,4%, 2% y 2%, respectivamente.
En la plaza local, el S&P Merval cedió 4,7%, pero ganó 0,6% en dólares por la caída del 5,8% del MEP y del 5,2% del Contado con Liquidación. La que más cayó fue Comercial del Plata (-8,7%), seguida por Metrogas (-7,7%) y Transportadora de Gas del Sur (-7,3%).
Los bonos argentinos operaron neutros en Wall Street, donde el Global 2030 cayó 0,4% y el Global 2038 subió apenas 0,01%. Así, el riesgo país subió levemente a 745 puntos básicos, lejos de los más de 1000 que alcanzó hace apenas 10 días.
Horacio Miguel Arana, economista de la Fundación Internacional Bases, señala que ""en materia global, el mundo está recalculando la tregua de 90 días, mientras que se disiparon todas las dudas en cuanto al esquema cambiario en el plano local"". Eso, según su mirada, hace que el riesgo país tienda a bajar porque ""los bonos argentinos ganan credibilidad"".
Sin embargo, aún está lejos el rango para acceder de lleno a los mercados internacionales, que según indica ""suele estar entre 400 y 500 puntos básicos"".

"Venezuela respalda la ""firme respuesta"" de Claudia Sheinbaum a los aranceles de EE.UU. - Infobae","Caracas, 16 abr (EFE).- Venezuela respaldó este miércoles la ""firme respuesta"" de la presidenta de México, Claudia Sheinbaum, a la política arancelaria del mandatario de Estados Unidos, Donald Trump, cuyo Gobierno impuso tasas del 25 % al acero, aluminio y a la industria automotriz de ese país latinoamericano, así como a los productos fuera del tratado de libre comercio T-MEC.
A través de Telegram, el titular de Exteriores venezolano, Yván Gil, informó de una reunión con el embajador mexicano en Caracas, Leopoldo de Gyves, a quien expresó su reconocimiento a Sheinbaum y a su ""destacada gestión y firme respuesta ante la imposición de aranceles"".
Según el mensaje del canciller, ambos funcionarios revisaron durante el encuentro la agenda bilateral y reafirmaron ""el compromiso mutuo de no interferir en los asuntos internos"", así como su disposición a ""trabajar conjuntamente"" para profundizar la integración regional.
La semana pasada, en la IX Reunión de la Comunidad de Estados Latinoamericanos y Caribeños (Celac), Sheinbaum propuso convocar una 'Cumbre por el Bienestar Económico' de la región, como respuesta a la guerra comercial y en pro de una mayor integración en esta materia.
En el evento, la mandataria consideró que la región tiene todo para fortalecerse por sí misma, incluida una población joven de 663 millones de habitantes, un PIB de 6,6 billones de dólares y abundantes recursos naturales.
Cuando el pasado 2 de abril Trump anunció lo que llamó ""aranceles recíprocos"" que implicaron tasas generalizadas del 10 % y unos volúmenes superiores para otras regiones y países -como China o la Unión Europea (UE)- que exportan mucho a EE.UU., México y Canadá quedaron fuera de la lista de países castigados.
Este lunes, Sheinbaum aseguró que su Gobierno busca negociar una reducción en materia de aranceles con EE.UU. en los sectores automotriz, de acero y aluminio.

Universities Win Pause on Trump Energy Department Funding Cuts,"A federal judge on Wednesday temporarily blocked the Trump administration from capping overhead and administrative costs for government-funded research at universities.
Nine universities, including Princeton University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, showed they would suffer “immediate and irreparable injury” if the US Department of Energy lowered the amount of indirect expenses it covered for grant recipients, according to a decision granting a motion for a temporary restraining order filed in the US District Court for the District of Massachusetts.

Congresswoman De La Cruz Highlights Community Needs During Food Bank Tour and Farmworker Roundtable,"Touring the Foodbank in Pharr Texas. Courtesy image Texas Border Business
By Roberto Hugo González
McAllen, Texas – Congresswoman Monica De La Cruz (TX-15) focused on two key challenges facing South Texans—food insecurity and labor shortages in agriculture—during a visit to the Rio Grande Valley Food Bank and a roundtable discussion with South Texas farmers.
Farmers roundtable. Courtesy image Congresswoman De La Cruz toured the Rio Grande Valley Food Bank, the seventh-largest food bank in Texas, where she met with staff and volunteers to understand better the scope of hunger and food insecurity in the region. The food bank is vital in distributing meals, offering nutrition education, and connecting individuals to community services across South Texas.
Key Problems Identified:
Rising Food Insecurity: With inflation and ongoing economic hardship, more families rely on food banks to meet basic needs. Limited Resources: Despite the food bank’s reach, it faces challenges in funding, food supply, and staffing to meet growing demand. Access to Nutrition Education: Many families lack knowledge about healthy food options and preparation, leading to long-term health issues. In a separate engagement, Congresswoman De La Cruz brought together South Texas farmers and agricultural producers for a roundtable discussion on the H-2A visa program. This federal program allows U.S. employers to hire foreign nationals for temporary agricultural jobs, which are an essential part of the labor force in South Texas.
Key Problems Identified:
Administrative Burden: Farmers have previously voiced frustration with the complex and often delayed process of securing H-2A workers. Worker Shortages: Many farms operate with fewer hands than needed, threatening productivity and economic stability. Visa Cap and Inflexibility: Seasonal visa limitations don’t always align with regional harvesting timelines, making planning difficult for producers. Congresswoman De La Cruz, a member of the House Agriculture Committee, emphasized her commitment to championing policies that support food security and the agricultural workforce.
Her visit emphasizes the interconnectedness of community well-being and a strong agricultural economy, and her actions signal a continued focus on solutions rooted in local input.",2025-04-17T00:27:00.000+03:00,https://texasborderbusiness.com/congresswoman-de-la-cruz-highlights-community-needs-during-food-bank-tour-and-farmworker-roundtable,Roberto H.

Guarda de São Carlos deve ganhar nome de Polícia Municipal após aprovação de PL,"A Câmara de Vereadores aprovou, em sessão da última terça-feira (15), o projeto de Lei que permite que a GM (Guarda Municipal) possa ser denominada também como Polícia Municipal de São Carlos.
O projeto n° 154/2025, de autoria de Gustavo Pozzi (PP), tramitava na Casa de Leis há mais de 14 dias e foi aprovado por maioria absoluta durante votação, com 13 votos favoráveis.
Foram contrários ao projeto os vereadores Djalma Nery (PSOL), Larissa Camargo (PCdoB), Raquel Auxiliadora (PT) e Lineu Navarro (PT).
Já os parlamentares Fernanda Castelano (PSOL), Sérgio Rocha (PRD) e Paulo Vieira (PP) não estavam presentes durante a votação.
Projeto original alteraria nome da GM
O projeto original protocolado por Pozzi previa a alteração do nome da Guarda Municipal para Polícia Municipal.
No entanto, a versão final do texto que foi aprovada no plenário – um substitutivo considerado menos radical – prevê que o órgão também possa ser denominado Polícia Municipal de São Carlos além do nome original já vigente.
Apesar da nova denominação, a ‘Polícia Municipal’, o órgão manterá as mesmas atribuições, direitos, deveres e estrutura organizacional atualmente estabelecidos para a GM.

La balanza comercial registró un superávit de US$ 323 millones con un fuerte aumento de las importaciones | Perfil,"La balanza comercial en marzo mantuvo su racha positiva con un superávit de US$ 323 millones, que representa una abrupta caída con respecto al resultado positivo de US$ 1.260 millones en el mismo mes del año pasado, según el último informe del INDEC. Con este registro, se encadenan 16 meses consecutivos de superávit.
El intercambio total de bienes sumó US$ 12.334 millones, con un alza interanual del 14%, impulsada por un notorio aumento de las importaciones.
Las exportaciones alcanzaron los US$ 6.329 millones, lo que implicó una baja del 2,5% respecto a marzo de 2024. Esta caída se explicó por una disminución del 4,2% en las cantidades vendidas, parcialmente compensada por un incremento del 1,8% en los precios.
Javier Milei lanzó una advertencia al campo: ""Liquiden ahora porque en junio vuelven las retenciones""
Los productos primarios y los combustibles y energía fueron los más afectados, con descensos de 16,1% y 13,5% respectivamente. En contraste, las manufacturas de origen industrial crecieron 13,1%, traccionadas por mayores precios, especialmente en piedras y metales preciosos.
Más importaciones
Por otro lado, las importaciones totalizaron US$ 6.006 millones, con una suba interanual del 38,7%. El aumento fue impulsado por un salto del 47,5% en las cantidades, pese a una caída de 6% en los precios.
Se destacaron las compras de vehículos automotores (+107%), bienes de capital (+74,1%) y bienes de consumo (+75,7%). El aumento refleja una recuperación de la demanda interna y un mayor dinamismo en sectores que dependen de insumos importados.
Aunque el índice de términos del intercambio mejoró un 8,3% respecto al año pasado —lo que indica que Argentina exportó a mejores precios relativos que los que pagó por importar—, la balanza comercial se vio afectada por el desequilibrio en volúmenes.
El informe muestra que si hubieran persistido los precios del año anterior, el país habría registrado un déficit de US$ 174 millones. Así, el superávit actual se sostiene más por precios favorables que por una mejora estructural del intercambio.
Los principales socios comerciales en marzo, en orden de importancia, fueron: Brasil, China, Unión Europea, Estados Unidos e India.

Beverly Mayor Mike Cahill Declares Re-Election Bid
Cahill said intends to run as the mayoral term shifts from two to four years beginning with this fall's election.
BEVERLY, MA — Beverly Mayor Mike Cahill officially launched his anticipated re-election campaign this week in what will be the first four-year term in the city's history.
Cahill has served as mayor for the past 12 years — winning six, two-year terms.
""I am the right person to lead our great city forward during these uncertain times at the national level,"" he said in his re-election statement. ""With deep relationships at all levels of government and across our business and non-profit communities, I have the experience and the know-how to get things done.""
Find out what's happening in Beverlyfor free with the latest updates from Patch.
Cahill said his priorities will be to make Beverly a place where everyone is welcome and is safe to live their lives free from discrimination, as well as a place where people can relocate to and choose to call their homes.
""We can ensure that Beverly continues to evolve in the coming years to meet all our residents' needs, while still preserving what makes our community special,"" Cahill said. ""I am invested in Beverly and want to continue to share this journey with you as your mayor.""

Cahill, who also served on the School Committee and the negotiating committee during the recent Beverly teachers' strike, said his administration increased the school budget from $48 million to $85 million over the past dozen years, and that he will fight for changes to state aid to more equitably fund education across cities and towns.
He said another priority will be to work for state investments in public transportation as a means to ensure Beverly meets its housing needs and ""remains the thriving, livable community we love.""
Critical projects Cahill said that he intends to push include the Hall-Whitaker and Kernwood Bridge replacements, Varian site cleanup, the Brimbal Avenue highway intersection, and the ongoing National Grid transmission line and Bridge Street reconstruction projects.
""I am the only candidate for mayor with the proven ability to expertly manage the over $180 million city budget, the only candidate who knows how to navigate the challenges this city will face over the coming four years,"" he said.
Cahill cited the increase of the city's ""Rainy Day"" fund from $750,000 to more than $23 million, new emergency services dispatch system, new fire ladder truck, new Beverly High School fields, street paving projects, LED street light project, fire station renovations and parks projects as among the accomplishments during his tenure.
""We have done this while carrying strong cash reserves year to year, which, together with our Rainy Day funds, will carry us through the next recession. Further, we have formalized our strong financial policies, and we've upgraded Beverly's bond rating to AA+ during my tenure,"" Cahill said. ""We have done all this and more, while at the same time solidifying Beverly's financial strength and preparing our city to withstand future economic hard times.
""Serving the people of Beverly as our mayor continues to be the great honor and privilege of my professional life. ... Beverly needs a strong, proven leader now more than ever. I believe that person is me. I am forever invested in this wonderful community and in you. Please continue to invest in me.""

Stora Enso gets approval for Junnikkala sawmill acquisition,"The Finnish Competition and Consumer Authority (FCCA) investigated the competitive effects of the merger between Stora Enso Oyj and Junnikkala Oy, particularly on the procurement of roundwood in the parties' procurement areas. The Authority assessed that the merger would not raise competition concerns, and therefore approved the merger unconditionally on 14 April 2025.
Stora Enso announced in October 2024 that it would acquire the entire share capital of sawmill and processing company Junnikkala. Junnikkala has three sawmills located in Kalajoki, Oulu and Oulainen, Finland. Stora Enso, in turn, has a sawmill in Veitsiluoto and a board mill in Oulu.
In the further proceedings, the FCCA examined in more detail how the transaction affects the log procurement market in the procurement areas of Stora Enso's Veitsiluoto sawmill and Junnikkala's Oulu sawmill. The procurement market refers to the companies' procurement of wood from forest owners.
Based on the investigations, the parties' combined market share will remain moderate after the acquisition and there will continue to be several competing wood buyers in the area. The parties' market power is also limited by the fact that competing wood buyers may expand their procurement areas if log prices decrease. In addition, the FCCA notes that the parties' raw material needs and wood procurement strategies differ.
Junnikkala Oy is a Finnish sawmill company whose business consists of manufacturing lumber and further processed products for both export and domestic sale. Junnikkala sawmills are located in Kalajoki, Oulu and Oulainen.
Stora Enso Oyj is a global manufacturer of renewable products for the packaging, biomaterials and wood products industries.",2025-04-17T00:29:00.000+03:00,https://www.lesprom.com/zh/news/Stora_Enso_gets_approval_for_Junnikkala_sawmill_acquisition_118400,Lesprom Network,positive
韩追加预算支持半导体产业_新闻动态_教育频道_云南网,"原标题：韩追加预算支持半导体产业
韩国政府15日召开经济长官会议暨加强产业竞争力长官会议，公布总额为12万亿韩元的追加预算方案，其中重点放在半导体产业金融支持。
根据该方案，韩国政府决定将对半导体产业的低息贷款和金融支持规模增加7万亿韩元，从原来的26万亿韩元增至33万亿韩元。其中4万亿韩元将直接投资于相关企业，此举被韩国产业界解读为特朗普政府对半导体征收关税前采取的先发制人措施。
该方案显示，当前京畿道龙仁—平泽半导体集群铺设输电线总成本为1.8万亿韩元，其中企业承担的70%即1.26万亿韩元将由国家预算支持。半导体投资税收抵扣率也将提高。目前，大中型企业可享受15%的税收抵免，中小企业可享受25%的税收抵免，从2025年起，对半导体投资还将额外提供5%的税收抵免。在该方案中，韩国政府还设立了针对生产尖端材料、零部件和设备的中小企业的投资补贴，并在本次补充预算中追加700亿韩元。
除半导体领域外，韩国政府还决定在人工智能领域额外投资1.8万亿韩元，包括在年内确保1万个GPU。汽车产业领域，政府推出了一项3万亿韩元的援助计划，通过国家银行提供金融支持的形式应对美国关税政策对韩国汽车行业的冲击。（薛严）",2025-04-17T00:37:33.859+03:00,http://edu.yunnan.cn/system/2025/04/17/033452264.shtml,"www.yunnan.cn,云南日报报业集团,云南网",positive
Feature: Sudanese refugees in Egypt embark on return journey with hope for peace | The Star,"by Mahmoud Fouly
CAIRO, April 16 (Xinhua) -- In a yard in Egypt's capital Cairo, a line of buses awaited, ready to transport Sudanese families back to their homeland. Parents organized their luggage and kept a watchful eye on their children, their faces radiating longing and hope as they observed their bags being loaded for the journey ahead.
Among them was Youssef Al-Waleed, a man in his 30s, who was arranging his family's luggage next to one of the buses. His wife and two children sat nearby, waiting for the long-anticipated departure.
""A stranger has to return to his homeland one day,"" Al-Waleed told Xinhua. ""We must go back to our homes and our land. But Egypt will always remain our second country, without a doubt.""
A short distance away, 63-year-old Mousa Othman Yassin sat beside his wife. Yassin explained that he traveled to Egypt to seek medical treatment rather than to escape the war, as securing essential medications in Sudan had become nearly impossible due to the deteriorating security conditions.
""Now, I hope to return and never again face the hardships that forced us to leave,"" Yassin said.
An armed conflict erupted in mid-April 2023 between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces over tensions linked to a planned political transition. The conflict has killed tens of thousands of people, displaced over 15 million, and left Sudan facing what the United Nations calls one of the world's worst humanitarian crises.
In late March, the SAF announced territorial gains in the capital Khartoum, calling on citizens abroad to return and help rebuild the country.
Amin Ismail, an advisor for initiatives at the Sudanese embassy in Cairo, estimated that approximately 3,000 Sudanese embark on a return journey each day, saying the surge began ""after the liberation of the capital"" and is expected to grow with initiatives for free return.
Ismail highlighted the high morale and the restoration of services in Khartoum, Bahri, and Omdurman -- three major cities in Sudan's capital region -- as key factors behind the surge in the home return of Sudanese refugees.
Among the crowd of Sudanese, Mohamed Issa, a travel agent from southern Egypt's Aswan, was busily assisting passengers, ensuring everyone was accounted for before departure.
His company offers free rides to Sudanese individuals who are unable to afford a ticket. ""Egyptians and Sudanese are brothers, and we must support each other in times of crisis,"" Issa said. ""It brings me joy to see smiles on their faces as they return home,"" he added.
Issa noted that such return trips had been organized for over a month, asserting that, according to his estimates, more than 3,000 Sudanese people traveled daily.
Due to its geographical proximity to and historical ties with Sudan, Egypt has emerged as the largest host country for Sudanese refugees fleeing the civil conflict. According to data from Egypt's government and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, more than 1.2 million Sudanese have sought refuge in Egypt since the beginning of the ongoing conflict.
Among the returnees were Amin Awad and his family, who moved to Egypt about eight months ago to escape intense clashes in their neighborhood in Khartoum.
""I never felt like a stranger in Egypt. Egyptians are just like the Sudanese people. We are truly like one nation,"" Awad, a father of six, said.
The Sudanese man expressed hope that peace and stability would soon return to Sudan and the Arab world. ""Safety is everything,"" he added.

City of Huntsville announces improvements to South Derrick Street Camp,"City of Huntsville announces improvements to South Derrick Street Camp
HUNTSVILLE, Ala. (
WAFF) - The City of Huntsville announced improvements to the South Derrick Street Camp on Wednesday. The camp had to be shut down and cleared out last year because of a fire.
Over the past few months, the city has been making improvements to the lot, hoping to prevent problems in the future.
Improvements include:
- Removing debris, clearing brush and disposing of illegally dumped concrete
- Pouring a hard-surface pad, which replaces the previous dirt lot to offer a more stable and sanitary surface
- Creating a 12’x12’ grid system with 84 individual spaces to provide more structured living areas
- Equipping each space with a 10’x10’ tent attached to a platform to keep occupants’ belongings off the ground
- Installing a metal privacy fence around the camp’s perimeter to enhance security
- Creating new entryways for emergency vehicle access
WAFF 48 is told people will be able to start coming back in a gradual process starting next week.
City leaders said there will be rules enforced on the property designed to keep everyone safe.
“The goal of these new community standards is to ensure safety and sanitary conditions in the camp,” said Community Development Manager Scott Erwin. “These guidelines were developed in consideration of the concerns raised by occupants and in coordination with CoC providers.”
The city says the camp is meant to be a temporary place for people to get help. They’ll be paired with organizations that can assist them in getting into more permanent shelter.

Undersheriff Amy Johnson to run for Kane County Sheriff,"Kane County Undersheriff Amy Johnson has announced she will run for sheriff in the 2026 election, with outgoing Kane County Sheriff Ron Hain backing her.
She will be seeking the Democratic nomination for Kane County sheriff next April in advance of the Nov. 3, 2026, general election.
Johnson first became a deputy at the sheriff’s office in 2004, according to past reporting. She’s since worked in the county as a patrol deputy, recruitment officer, detective, crime scene evidence technician, grant writer, field training officer and juvenile officer.
She said she had not thought about becoming sheriff until she was selected to be undersheriff and it became possible that she could take over for Hain when he stepped down.
“That was where that light bulb went off on, ‘Yes, this is actually a very plausible situation that I very could well consider and I really want to, in being based in Kane County all my life,’” Johnson said.
She said she went public with her intention to run Tuesday, but that she and Hain had been discussing it for a few months.
“I’m pretty much doing the same things day-by-day as the sheriff,” Johnson said of her current role. “Kind of got trial by fire with that aspect of it.”
Johnson filed for a campaign committee with the Illinois State Board of Elections in January, according to the State Board of Elections website .
Hain, for his part, was first elected in 2018. He is serving his second term as sheriff and will not run for a third in 2026, he said.
“It’s just enough,” he told The Beacon-News Tuesday, but did not say what would be next for him after he finishes out his term next year.
He said the last seven years have been “very unique” to be the sheriff due to the COVID-19 pandemic, unrest in 2020 following the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis and major changes to state public safety policies.
Johnson becoming sheriff eventually was “always a conversation,” according to Hain, who appointed Johnson to be undersheriff in 2022.
He says he’s behind her campaign and plans to help with strategy for the race. He is listed as the chair of her campaign committee according to the Illinois State Board of Elections.
Kane sheriff looks to open substations Megan Jones / The Beacon-News Kane County Sheriff Ron Hain in 2023. Hain said he will not be seeking re-election in 2026. (Megan Jones / The Beacon-News) “She knows our traditions, she knows the office,” Hain said on Tuesday, noting that Johnson plans to continue current substance abuse programming and vocational and job placement initiatives meant to reduce the jail population in the county.
In addition to backing these initiatives, Johnson said she wants to give equal focus to public safety initiatives.
“Public safety was kind of left in the dark because we were always focused on corrections,” Johnson said on Wednesday.
She said that equal focus could look like more updated training for officers — including training on mental health and de-escalation to reduce their reliance on social workers with already-high caseloads — and having more deputies out on the streets engaging with the community
And while the county faces impending budgetary issues due to the apparent failure of its sales tax referendum question earlier this month, Johnson said they will work within those possible constraints, and that their training, because it’s operated in-house, wouldn’t cost extra.
Johnson’s campaign is officially launching at an event on May 14, she said on Wednesday, at Alley 64 in St. Charles, per her campaign website .

Como pocas veces se ha conocido de forma pública, el Vaticano, por medio del papa Francisco, hizo una generosa donación a uno de los pueblos más golpeados por la naturaleza en las últimas semanas.
El papa Francisco ha decidido enviar ""una generosa contribución"" para apoyar en la ayuda de emergencia a los afectados por el terremoto de Birmania (Myanmar), que causó más de 3.600 muertos el mes pasado, informó este miércoles el Dicasterio para Servicio de Desarrollo Humano Integral del Vaticano.
""Tras el terremoto que azotó Myanmar con violencia extraordinaria, causando miles de muertos, heridos, desplazados y enormes daños materiales, el Santo Padre decidió enviar un generoso aporte para el socorro de poblaciones en fase de emergencia"", aseguró el organismo un comunicado.

Un fuerte terremoto de magnitud 7,7 sacudió Myanmar el pasado 28 de marzo, lo que causó más de 3.600 muertos y efectos devastadores.
También dejó más 5.000 heridos de gravedad, según el último balance de la junta militar. Miles de víctimas continúan durmiendo en las calles por el derrumbe de sus hogares o por miedo a regresar a estos, ante las réplicas que han continuado agitando la zona.

A federal judge in St. Paul ordered Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Tuesday to reinstate the legal status of a Metropolitan State University student from Thailand.
The order from U.S. District Judge Jeffrey Bryan in the case of Rattanand Ratsantiboon marks the first intervention by a federal judge into ICE’s termination of the legal status of Minnesota’s international students. Dozens of international students in Minnesota and around the country have seen their legal status terminated in recent weeks in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS), which governs whether they are lawfully present in the United States.
David Wilson, an attorney for Ratsantiboon, said his client was “very relieved” by the judge’s order. Ratsantiboon’s status has once again been activated, and he can continue going to school and be considered lawfully present, Wilson said. “It’s a very positive step,” Wilson said. “But it is just the first step. This matter is going to go on for some time.”
Ratsantiboon, a 31-year-old nursing student at Metro State, learned that ICE terminated his legal status on March 28 after his name emerged in a criminal records check, and filed a lawsuit on April 8. Ratsantiboon has two driving infractions from 2018: a petty misdemeanor careless driving violation and a gross misdemeanor drunk-driving conviction.
“Ratsantiboon stands to lose his lawful status in his present country of residence, a semester’s worth of course credits, and future career prospects,” Bryan wrote. “By contrast, the temporary nature of the requested relief poses minimal harm to Defendants.”
Bryan issued a 14-day emergency temporary restraining order, and ordered ICE to reinstate Ratsantiboon’s status retroactive to March 28 and refrain from taking any further action against his legal status or visa.
According to court filings, Ratsantiboon paid more than $7,000 in tuition for the spring semester and is scheduled to take final exams in late April and May. In an affidavit to the court, he wrote that he was “embarrassed” by his drunk-driving conviction and that he had completed his probation and all of its requirements. He wrote that he worried he would be deported or barred from entry to the United States if the judge did not take action.
“I have been progressing for years in America,” he wrote. “I studied English, became proficient enough to attend college, and finally have found a calling that suits me. My family has supported me all these years, and paid thousands in tuition so I can eventually graduate with a nursing degree. The uncertainty of my status has made it very difficult to study.”
Ratsantiboon said he was scared he would have to drop his courses for the semester if the judge did not intervene.
“If I’m not able to complete the semester, all this money, time, and energy will have been lost,” he wrote. “I’ll have to redo everything in the future which means I may never accomplish my goal.”
Ratsantiboon described debilitating fear since ICE terminated his status.
“Ever since I found out that ICE terminated my SEVIS, I’ve been consumed by fear and anxiety every moment of the day,” he wrote. “I’ve been plunged into uncertainty about my future. I don’t know if I’ll be detained and deported. I don’t know if I’ll have to figure out how to start my life all over again in a different country. I don’t know what to do.”

In his order, Bryan said that Ratsantiboon would face “irreparable harm” without temporary relief.
The termination of Ratsantiboon’s legal status “renders him immediately ineligible to attend classes and sit for his final examinations,” Bryan wrote. “Ratsantiboon thus faces the imminent prospect of losing credit for the coursework he has thus far performed. In addition, the termination of Ratsantiboon’s SEVIS record forces him to live in uncertain legal status while he pursues this matter, which can constitute a separate irreparable harm.”
In his order, Bryan noted that “nonimmigrant status,” a category that includes international students, can be revoked only for limited reasons: if the person had received a waiver, and that waiver was revoked; if a private bill has been introduced to grant that person permanent resident status; or if notice has been published in the Federal Register that the person’s status will be revoked due to national security or public safety reasons.
“None of those three circumstances appear to be present in this case,” Bryan wrote. “An agency’s unexplained refusal to follow its own regulations effecting individuals’ procedural benefits poses a high probability that the agency is not acting in accordance with the [Administrative Procedure Act].”
Wilson said that he’s representing a handful of students who have all had “essentially a computer match to some kind of contact with the state court system.” Even in some cases where a charge was dismissed or the case was resolved, students are seeing their status terminated, he said.
In one of his cases — that of University of Minnesota grad student Ziliang Jin — his client had a dismissed charge of driving with a suspended license, on top of a few parking tickets and a speeding ticket. He said the government is not being clear what it is relying on in its determination to terminate students’ status. “That’s part of the problem,” he said.
He described Trump’s efforts to terminate student status as a “digital deportation movement,” and criticized the administration’s efforts to change the rules without notice.
The government “unilaterally” taking away something people depend on, without providing an opportunity for those people to argue their side or be heard, is “anti-American,” Wilson said.
A hearing regarding whether to extend Ratsantiboon’s relief, and if so, for how long, is scheduled for April 28.

DILWORTH, Minn. (Valley News Live) - Minnesota Governor Tim Walz (DFL) was in Dilworth today. He visited the town’s newly-built fire station, which is still under construction.
The previous station has been operating since 1980, and was in need of a much-needed makeover. They broke ground last May, and have made significant progress since then.
The new station is nearly fully-functional, and is set to be completed this summer. The Dilworth Fire Chief, Scott Payne, said firefighters moved into the building just two days before the event.
Governor Walz received a tour of the new facility, which was funded by a nearly $3 million dollar infrastructure bill for state projects - all signed by Walz in 2023.
The Minnesota Governor was previously in Dilworth in 2021 showing his support for the project.
Today, April 16, Gov. Walz again showed his support for bonding bills like these to protect people across Minnesota.
“Tax dollars from all over the state helped build this because we understand how important the community is and your safety, too,” he said. “This is such a good thing for the community. It’s a good thing for citizens to see that the government is able to work together in a pretty much non-partisan manner, and we’re able to get world-class facilities like these.”
He said the work being done in Dilworth, such as the fire station, should be a ‘model’ for other communities statewide.
“If I were other communities, I would come here and take a snapshot of what this community did. I would make that the model of how you move things forward. This has just been a positive experience, and for me to be able to come back here, it’s been great,” said Walz.

"""No justice. No peace. No ICE in our streets,"" the Hands Off Our Students! rally defends international students | Campus News | redandblack.com","University of Georgia students, faculty and other members of the Athens-Clarke County community gathered at North West Lawn near the Miller Learning Center on Wednesday, April 16 to protest the recent revocations of international student visas. Demonstrators demanded the UGA administration and University System of Georgia take action against ICE and to protect their international students.
The protest was organized by UGA’s Young Democratic Socialists of America and the UGA chapter of the United Campus Workers of Georgia. They were joined in support by organizations including other chapters of UCWGA and the Party for Socialism and Liberation.
Keegan Brooks, a junior anthropology and political science major, assisted in the organization of the event as a member of UCWGA-UGA.
According to U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, the Trump administration has revoked hundreds of international student visas, targeting international students who have participated in activism.
“A lot of these international students, some of these revoked student visas are for online political speech, but many of them are for any sort of history of a law enforcement interaction,” Brooks said.
UCWGA-UGA is in contact with students in Georgia, including UGA and Kennesaw State University, who’ve been personally impacted by their loss of a student visa.
“You’ve seen universities in other states providing more support than what’s necessarily happening here at UGA,” Brooks said.
During the protest, Brooks spoke in addition to university math professor Joe Fu and undergraduate students Aspen Davis, Moss Joslin, Dylan Woolsey and graduate student Tom Sheehan.
Demonstrators held signs saying “TRUMP ADMIN & UGA: HANDS OFF OUR STUDENTS!” “RESTORE ALL STUDENT VISAS NOW!” and “In the name of humanity, WE REFUSE TO ACCEPT A FASCIST AMERICA.”
Joslin, a member of UCWGA-UGA and senior science illustration major, spoke at the protest, addressing Kilmar Abrego Garcia’s mistaken deportation, and refusal of his return by El Salvador President Nayib Bukele.
“The world moves on, but we are in crisis,,” Joslin said. “ICE is moving, tracking people, kidnapping them off the street daily, forcing students to be deported … We are standing up. We are showing the university that we want to protect our international students.”
Joslin went on to challenge the crowd.
“Wake up people,” Joslin said. “Now is the time to know our neighbors so that we can bring the fight to them ourselves.”",2025-04-17T00:30:00.000+03:00,https://www.redandblack.com/uganews/no-justice-no-peace-no-ice-in-our-streets-the-hands-off-our-students-rally/article_946ba993-cf61-4fb4-a891-259219edaa56.html,Caroline Newbern,positive

CCJ celebrates 20th anniversary,"CCJ celebrates 20th anniversary
PORT OF SPAIN, Trinidad (CMC) — The Caribbean Court of Justice is on Wednesday celebrating its 20th anniversary with the outgoing President Justice Adrian Saunders saying, “today is a time for reflection and giving thanks”.
The judicial institution of the Caribbean Community (Caricom), established in 2005 to replace the London-based Privy Council as the region’s highest and final court, has both an appellate and original jurisdiction. It also serves as an international tribunal interpreting the Revised Treaty of Chaguaramas that governs the 15-member regional integration grouping.
Saunders, the third Caribbean national to head the Trinidad-based court following the late Justice Michael de la Bastide and Sir Dennis Byron, said for the past 20 years, the CCJ has upheld the rule of law, safeguarded rights and strengthened Caribbean jurisprudence.
“The court has been a shining example of Caribbean ingenuity, with its innovative funding arrangement, in the form of the CCJ Trust Fund, and, through the establishment of the Regional Judicial and Legal Services Commission, its insulation from external interference in its recruitment practices,” said the St Vincent and the Grenadines born jurist.
“This anniversary is not just a celebration of 20 long years, but also of our enduring commitment to delivering accessible, fair and efficient justice to the people and states of the Caribbean.
“It is a privilege and an honour to serve the people of this region, and we, the judges and staff of the court, are incredibly grateful to have had that opportunity over the past 20 years. We look forward to doing so for the next 20 years and beyond,” Justice Saunders said.
The milestone was celebrated with an Interfaith Service of Reflection and Prayer at the Queen’s Hall, in St Ann’s on the outside of the capital, which was also attended by the Trinidad and Tobago head of state, Christine Kangaloo.
It was also attended by members of the Judiciary of Trinidad and Tobago, government, the Inter-Religious Organisation (IRO), regional stakeholders, members of the diplomatic corps, the legal fraternity, and commissioners of the Regional Judicial and Legal Services Commission (RJLSC).
RJLSC member, Sophia Chote SC, told the ceremony that the achievements of the CCJ are the achievements of the Caribbean region.
“We continue to have commissions which are responsible and which ensure that the CCJ’s bench is populated only with the best. The judges themselves are acutely aware of their responsibility to the region and discharge their duties with diligence and integrity,” she said.
“The registrar and her staff and other arms of the organisation continue to perform their duties with responsibility and innovation. The educational arm of the CCJ has had valuable outreach with judges, lawyers and law students throughout the region,” Chote added.",2025-04-17T00:12:00.000+03:00,https://www.jamaicaobserver.com/2025/04/16/ccj-celebrates-20th-anniversary,KEVIN JACKSON; Observer writer,positive

〔記者翁聿煌／新北報導〕新北市副市長劉和然於四月十四日至十六日到韓國參加「環境永續發展理事會（ICLEI）全球執委會及高階議題」會議，與多個國外城市的與會代表交流，他昨天在氣候高峰會以「賦能公寓社區：推動社區主導能源解方的催化角色」為題發表演說，分享新北市推動公寓大廈社區能源解決方案的治理經驗。
劉和然指出，住宅減碳是各城市必須面對的課題，許多住宅已轉變為集合式住宅並形成社區組織型態，因為分散、私有的特性，需要政府的政策引導，鼓勵民眾成為減碳的主力，推動以管委會為主體的減碳輔導機制，讓社區自主決策，政府從旁提供技術及資源支持，打造由下而上的減碳行動模式。
他表示，新北市努力減少溫室氣體排放，以「賦能」（Empowerment）為概念，引導社區透過補助、技術輔導與資源協助，幫助落實減碳及生活品質提升。
劉和然說，新北市府以四項作為支持社區減碳，第一是「需求與診斷」，確認社區的節能需求與財力期望；第二是「技術與陪伴」，安排低碳社區規劃師和節電診所，輔導社區提出改善方案；第三是「經費支持」，提供補助減少社區的財力負擔；第四是「效益回饋」，電費降低及再生能源收益讓社區即時感受到減碳的好處，促成房價提升更是鼓勵民眾參與的關鍵路徑。",2025-04-17T00:30:00.000+03:00,https://news.ltn.com.tw/news/life/paper/1702170,自由時報電子報,positive

Vladimir Putin says many countries eager to cooperate with Russia in space industry - International Affairs,"Vladimir Putin with students of the Bauman Moscow State Technical University.
Photo: Krimlin.ru
Russia is an attractive international partner in space exploration as it has laid good groundwork since the last century for exploring deep space, Russian President Vladimir Putin said at a meeting with students of the Bauman Moscow State Technical University on Wednesday.
One of the students told the Russian leader that he was studying plasma propulsion engines and, like many other Bauman University students, he was very much inspired by deep space exploration.
""It seems to me that plasma propulsion units will make this process much quicker and more energy efficient,"" the student said, asking the president about whether the Russian state would support this sphere and develop international cooperation in the coming years.
The Russian president said in response that such ideas had originated back in the 1960s and Russia had laid good groundwork in this field.
""And, of course, when we talk about deep space, we look attractive for our potential partners also because we have the relevant technological potential,"" he explained.
Russia is a leader in this sphere, Putin stressed.
""However, we could have done and should have practically accomplished much more than we have done until now,"" he said. ""We could have done this, if we had worked more purposefully on this issue.""
This field is very promising ""from the standpoint of transportation and the standpoint of moving objects and from the standpoint of energy sources for implementing the projects related to deep space,"" the Russian leader said.
""Without this, deep space exploration is hardly possible and this is our competitive advantage,"" Putin stressed.
Many countries, including members of the BRICS group, are interested in collaborating with Russia in space, President Vladimir Putin stated during a meeting with a group of students, TASS reports.
""As for cooperation with other countries, such as the United States, it continues,"" Putin remarked. ""The International Space Station has been established and is operational. There are various ideas about how it should conclude its work and what our next steps will be. However, our efforts will certainly continue, including with new partners,"" he assured.
Putin emphasized that Russia and China have ""major plans - interesting, ambitious, and grandiose.""
""In general, we are also collaborating with the BRICS countries, including India, South Africa, and Brazil,"" he added.
Putin said that Roscosmos is in touch with NASA.
""This cooperation does not stop. It cannot stop, because so many countries are interested. Especially since we were and still are leaders in many areas. So, we are of interest to our partners,"" Putin summarized.
Russia and the US continue to cooperate in outer space no matter what, Vladimir Putin said at a meeting with university students.
""Cooperation in space goes on with the Americans. Despite everything, it all continues, but the Europeans have decided to go for a suspension. It is their choice,"" he said.
The Russian leader reminded the students of a historical fact that marked the beginning of the US-Russia space partnership.
""The first docking happened in 1975, between Soyuz 19 and Apollo. It is when the cooperation started, which later resulted in the International Space Station. This work continues,"" Putin said. ""The Soyuz-Apollo docking <...> there was a very interesting moment there. Maybe you know about it. If not, I will tell you. It was planned that the docking would take place over Moscow. In fact, it actually took place over the Elbe. Exactly 30 years before, Soviet and American troops met there, delivering a final blow to Nazi Germany. So exactly 30 years later, in 1975, Apollo and Soyuz docked right above the Elbe."".
Vladimir Putin likened US entrepreneur Elon Musk to Soviet rocket engineer Sergei Korolev and said such people are not born very often.
""You know, there's a man – he lives in the States – Musk, who, one might say, raves about Mars. It is not often that such people, charged with a certain idea, appear in the human population. If even it seems incredible to me today, after a while such ideas often materialize. Just like in their time the ideas of Korolev, our other pioneers, got to materialize. They seemed incredible - some of the plans they made. But they all materialized,"" he said at the meeting with university students.
""A mission to Mars would be very hard. It now seems very difficult to implement. If you take an interest in this, you probably know,"" Putin went on to say.
European countries have halted space cooperation with Russia, but continue to use Russian equipment, proof of its great value and efficacy, Vladimir Putin said at a meeting with students.
""In spite of the fact that our European partners stopped cooperating with us, essentially halting everything, nevertheless, Russian equipment is still functioning at their stations and facilities, including, I think, in Mars research. You get the picture,"" the Russian leader said.
Putin stressed that the equipment is being used even today. ""This shows how valuable it is for them. They scrapped cooperation but did not remove the equipment. The equipment is working,"" he stated.
That said, the Russian head of state reiterated that given how complicated space technologies can be, cooperation becomes all the more important. ""Every millimeter is brimming with ideas, filled with modern technologies. Back in the day, the Soviet Union, and then Russia, engaged in active interaction with its partners and until recently, we had been working with the Europeans,"" Putin emphasized, reiterating that cooperation was suspended at the initiative of the Europeans themselves.

國際人權組織人權觀察表示，數據不能揭露背後問題，許多非法移民在地中海溺亡，也有人在波蘭及白羅斯邊境遭受毆打，還有人被困在各種沼澤、森林及沙漠之中，如非法越境數量下降是由於歐盟威懾措施造成，相關措施顯然伴隨侵犯人權行為。",2025-04-17T00:15:00.000+03:00,https://hk.on.cc/hk/bkn/cnt/intnews/20250417/bkn-20250417051513689-0417_00992_001.html,,positive

Gov. Morrisey touts W.Va. microgrid bill,"Gov. Morrisey touts W.Va. microgrid bill
BLUEFIELD, W.Va. (WVVA) - West Virginia Governor Patrick Morrisey is touting what he believes to be a major economic opportunity for the mountain state.
Morrisey called West Virginia “the single best place in America for data centers.” Morrisey says a recently passed microgrid bill will attract investment from companies all over the world who are looking for their own personal power grid to conduct business.
WVVA spoke with Morrisey about the microgrid bill on Wednesday after he unveiled the state’s Mountaineer Mile Trail initiative.
“It’s going to set up a framework where we can be able to attract a massive amount of capital to our state which could lead to jobs and really for our future,” said Morrisey.
Once in place, the law will allow companies to utilize coal, natural gas and other resources to power the smaller power grids.
“I know a lot of times people have always asked me what does West Virginia need to do to get to the next level? These ideas about clearing the regulatory pathway, being much more attractive than other states. That’s how we’re going to get it done,” said Morrisey.
Morrisey says it will likely take a few years before the state can see the benefits of the bill.
“We’ve planted the seeds. That’s something that could be a very big tree and I’m thrilled about it,” said Morrisey.
Morrisey says there will likely be some special sessions in the legislature revolving around PEIA as well as tax reform.

Ley firmada por Gavin Newsom en California que permitirá a ciertos residentes obtener licencia remunerada,"Ley firmada por Gavin Newsom en California que permitirá a ciertos residentes obtener licencia remunerada
El gobernador Gavin Newsom firma la AB 2123, que pocos conocen y que transforma el acceso a la licencia familiar remunerada (PFL) en California, beneficiando a los cuidadores de familiares gravemente enfermos.
California: Gavin Newsom firma ley que prohíbe a los empleadores solicitar la licencia de conducir como requisito de trabajoMuy buenas noticias para residentes de Florida: Ron DeSantis anuncia fin de estos carriles de alivio de congestión en el estado
El gobernador Gavin Newsom aprobó la AB 2123, una legislación que transforma el acceso a la licencia familiar remunerada (PFL) en California. La ley, impulsada por la asambleísta Diane Papan, exime a los trabajadores de usar hasta dos semanas de su tiempo de vacaciones antes de recibir los beneficios del PFL.
Este cambio ofrece un respaldo concreto a los cuidadores de Estados Unidos, especialmente aquellos que deben atender a familiares con enfermedades graves como la ELA. Al eliminar esta exigencia, se protege a quienes viven de sueldo a sueldo y se facilita el uso del tiempo libre remunerado sin afectar sus derechos laborales.

¿Cuál es el principal cambio que introduce la ley AB 2123 para los cuidadores?
La AB 2123, firmada por Gavin Newsom, modifica un aspecto clave de la política de licencia familiar remunerada (PFL): ya no obliga a los trabajadores a consumir previamente hasta dos semanas de su tiempo de vacaciones antes de acceder a los beneficios del programa. Esta modificación permite que los empleados con responsabilidades de cuidado tomen hasta ocho semanas de licencia sin que eso implique perder sus días de descanso.
Gracias a esta reforma, los empleados podrán enfocarse en brindar el cuidado necesario sin comprometer su bienestar laboral o económico. Además, este avance fortalece el papel de los cuidadores dentro del sistema de salud de California, al reconocer su aporte indispensable. Con esta medida, se prioriza el equilibrio entre vida laboral y familiar, y se ofrece mayor apoyo a las familias que dependen de un solo ingreso o viven de sueldo a sueldo, brindándoles mayor seguridad y estabilidad en momentos de crisis.4o

La nueva normativa se alinea con los valores que Gavin Newsom ha promovido durante su mandato, centrados en la equidad, la justicia social y el fortalecimiento del tejido familiar en California.

Redditi in crescita e Irpef record: i numeri che premiano le scelte del governo,"Nel 2023 il reddito medio degli italiani è cresciuto del 5%, arrivando a 24.830 euro: un incremento superiore al +0,7% registrato dal Pil reale nello stesso anno. Un risultato che potrebbe riflettere anche gli effetti dei provvedimenti economici del governo Meloni, tra taglio del cuneo e riforma fiscale.
È questa la fotografia che emerge dai dati sulle dichiarazioni dei redditi 2024 diffusi dal Dipartimento delle Finanze del Mef. Il totale del reddito Irpef dichiarato ha superato per la prima volta i mille miliardi di euro, toccando quota 1.027,7 miliardi, con un aumento del 5,9% rispetto all’anno precedente. I contribuenti sono stati oltre 42,5 milioni, in crescita dell’1,3%.
A trainare il totale, ancora una volta, sono soprattutto i redditi da lavoro dipendente (53,9% del totale) e da pensione (30%). Il reddito medio dei lavoratori dipendenti si attesta a 23.290 euro, quello dei pensionati a 21.260 euro. Significativamente più alti i redditi medi da lavoro autonomo, che raggiungono i 70.360 euro, mentre gli imprenditori individuali dichiarano in media 29.250 euro.
L’imposta netta effettiva versata all’Erario è stata pari a 189,9 miliardi di euro (+9%), con un’imposta media di 5.660 euro a contribuente. Tuttavia, il carico fiscale continua a essere fortemente sbilanciato: il 78% dei contribuenti, con redditi fino a 35mila euro, versa solo il 36% dell’imposta totale, mentre il restante 64% grava sul restante 22% con redditi superiori a questa soglia. In particolare, i contribuenti tra i 35mila e i 70mila euro da soli pagano il 30% dell’Irpef netta.
I redditi più elevati, ovvero sopra i 300mila euro annui, sono dichiarati da appena lo 0,2% dei contribuenti, che contribuiscono solo per il 7,1% del totale dell’imposta netta (in calo rispetto al 7,8% dell’anno precedente).
Una parte consistente della platea – oltre 11,8 milioni di persone – non versa alcuna Irpef, tra soggetti esonerati per reddito basso o completamente compensati dal trattamento integrativo.
A livello territoriale, persistono forti disuguaglianze. La Lombardia si conferma la regione con il reddito medio più alto (29.120 euro), seguita dalla provincia autonoma di Bolzano (28.780 euro). In fondo alla classifica la Calabria, con appena 18.230 euro di reddito medio.
Quanto alle partite Iva, sono 4,17 milioni i contribuenti che hanno presentato la dichiarazione Iva per il 2023. Il volume d’affari complessivo dichiarato ammonta a 4.737 miliardi di euro, in calo del 2,7%. Tuttavia, crescono alcuni settori chiave, come il commercio (+19%), le costruzioni specializzate (+11,1%) e l’industria alimentare (+6,6%). Tra le regioni con maggiore crescita nel volume d’affari spiccano Molise (+9,9%), Calabria (+9,2%) e Abruzzo (+8,7%), mentre il Lazio registra un forte calo (-18,7%).
Nel complesso, i dati mostrano una dinamica positiva dei redditi, in controtendenza rispetto alla debole
crescita economica del Paese, e suggeriscono un impatto concreto delle recenti misure fiscali e di sostegno al reddito adottate dal governo. Ma confermano anche l’urgenza di una redistribuzione più equa del carico fiscale.

FIFA President Gianni Infantino says U.S. will be welcoming to international fans for 2026 World Cup,"FIFA President Gianni Infantino on Wednesday said that he has “received assurances from the White House that, despite increased scrutiny of visitors to the country since President Donald Trump’s return to office, fans from abroad will be welcomed for the 2026 World Cup,” according to Steven Goff of the WASHINGTON POST. After meeting Trump last month in D.C., Infantino met with U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi and FBI Director Kash Patel last week in Miami to “discuss security and potential issues involving the expected hundreds of thousands of fans from abroad” expected to attend the tournament. Infantino on Tuesday “discussed matters” with Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy. Infantino on Wednesday said, “It is very important we have the engagement of the different government agencies to make sure that security is guaranteed, that fans can travel to the U.S. and around the U.S., that transportation is working perfectly, that the world will be welcomed.” Goff notes in early March, Trump established a White House task force that he will chair to “coordinate federal agencies in ‘planning, organizing and executing’” both the Club World Cup this summer and 2026 World Cup. Infantino said, “We got all these guarantees from the government, who is very, very engaged to make sure this Club World Cup is a huge success, because this will pave the path as well for next year” (WASHINGTON POST, 4/16).",2025-04-17T00:32:00.000+03:00,https://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com/Articles/2025/04/16/fifas-infantino-says-us-will-be-welcoming-to-international-fans-for-26-world-cup,Sports Business Journal,positive

QXO Announces Common Stock Offering | QXO Stock News,"- QXO Inc. (
QXO, Financial) plans a $500 million common stock offering to fund the acquisition of Beacon Roofing Supply.
- Underwriters Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs have the option to purchase an additional $75 million in shares.
- The offering will result in approximately 8-9% dilution of existing shareholders' stakes.
QXO Inc. (QXO) has announced a strategic move to raise $500 million through a common stock offering. This initiative includes an additional option for underwriters to purchase up to $75 million of shares at the same price. The primary goal of this capital raise is to finance a portion of the company's pending acquisition of Beacon Roofing Supply, a transaction valued at approximately $11 billion.
The offering, which is not contingent upon the completion of the acquisition, provides QXO with flexibility in capital allocation. This approach suggests that QXO's management is prepared for various scenarios, including potential regulatory challenges or alternative strategic opportunities.
Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, prominent investment banks, are serving as underwriters for this offering. Their involvement is a testament to the institutional confidence in QXO's strategic direction. The transaction will be executed through multiple trading platforms, including the New York Stock Exchange and the over-the-counter market.
Current shareholders should prepare for a potential dilution of approximately 8-9% of their existing holdings as QXO is expected to issue around 35-40 million new shares, assuming the stock's market price remains steady. This dilution could initially pressure earnings per share and stock prices. However, successful integration of the Beacon acquisition could significantly enhance QXO's growth prospects.
This offering represents QXO's calculated shift towards equity financing amidst higher interest rates, aiming to maintain balance sheet flexibility. The move into the roofing supply sector may either represent vertical integration within construction materials or a strategic diversification into new markets.",2025-04-17T00:40:43.897+03:00,https://www.gurufocus.com/news/2785266/qxo-announces-common-stock-offering-qxo-stock-news,@gurufocus,positive

SNV, Financial) reported a first-quarter revenue of $570.85 million, surpassing analyst expectations which were set at $570.04 million. The financial services company experienced a remarkable 67% increase in earnings per share, driven by a combination of net interest margin expansion, a reduction in credit loss provisions, and efficient expense management.
During the quarter, the company achieved its highest level of funded loan production since the last quarter of 2022 and saw credit losses drop to their lowest in over three years. This performance indicates an ongoing positive momentum for the firm.
However, the quarter wasn't without its challenges. Increasing caution among borrowers and investors was noted, likely due to concerns over consumer spending sustainability and the potential economic impacts of higher tariffs and possible federal government layoffs. Despite these concerns and an uncertain economic and interest rate landscape, Synovus remains optimistic about its financial direction. This confidence is reflected in the company's revised guidance for the remainder of the year.

México tiene acceso favorable a los mercados financieros pese a incertidumbre: SHCP
Luego de que las agencias calificadoras Fitch Ratings y R&I ratificaran la nota soberana de México, en BBB- y BBB+, respectivamente, ambas con perspectiva Estable, la Secretaría de Hacienda y Crédito Público reiteró su compromiso para mantener finanzas públicas saludables, así como reducir el déficit fiscal.
México tiene garantizado un acceso favorable a los mercados financieros internacionales pese a la incertidumbre que se vive hoy en día, destacó la Secretaría de Hacienda y Crédito Público (SHCP).
Luego de que las agencias calificadoras Fitch Ratings y R&I ratificaran la nota soberana de México, en BBB- y BBB+, respectivamente, ambas con perspectiva Estable, Hacienda reiteró su compromiso para mantener finanzas públicas saludables, así como reducir el déficit fiscal.
""Estas ratificaciones de la deuda soberana permitirán al país continuar accediendo en condiciones favorables a los mercados financieros nacionales e internacionales. La Secretaría de Hacienda y Crédito Público reitera su compromiso con la estabilidad de las finanzas públicas y con una trayectoria sostenible de la deuda"", dijo en un comunicado la dependencia a cargo de Edgar Amador Zamora.
Si bien Fitch destacó que el gobierno mexicano ha mantenido una política fiscal prudente, con unas reservas internacionales en un nivel elevado, advirtió que el moderado crecimiento limita la calificación del país.
Asimismo, modificaron a la baja su estimado de crecimiento del Producto Interno Bruto (PIB) mexicano a una contracción de 0.4%, para luego en el 2026 crecer 0.8 por ciento.
""Es probable que la desaceleración económica ya en curso se agrave ante el agresivo giro hacia el proteccionismo comercial en Estados Unidos bajo la administración Donald Trump. Sin embargo, actualmente prevemos que estos acontecimientos reforzarán el moderado crecimiento ya reflejado en la calificación, pero no lo empeorarán de forma significativa y duradera. Esperamos que la administración de la presidenta Claudia Sheinbaum mantenga sus objetivos de consolidación fiscal, en general, según lo previsto, a pesar de este difícil contexto"", consignó la calificadora.
Este año, el gobierno espera lograr una consolidación fiscal, para reducir el déficit de 5.7 a 3.9% del PIB.
En tanto, la calificadora R&I coincidió en que el crecimiento económico de México podría desacelerarse como consecuencia de cambios en la política comercial de Estados Unidos.
Para este año, la Secretaría de Hacienda prevé que la economía crezca entre 1.5 y 2.3%, algo que ha sido considerado como extremadamente optimista ante la incertidumbre actual ocasionada por las tensiones comerciales por la imposición de aranceles por parte de Estados Unidos a diversos países.

佳能公司（NYSE: CE）近日正式宣佈將於5月12日支付每股0.03美元的季度股息，此次股息與之前相同，顯示出該公司在面對市場挑戰時依然保持穩健的財務狀況。根據公告，4月28日為登記股東的截止日期，而在此日期之後的交易將不再享有本次股息。
佳能作為一家全球領先的化工產品製造商，其股息收益率目前為0.32%。這一數字雖然不算特別高，但公司穩定的現金流和盈利能力使得許多投資者仍然願意持有其股票。近期，分析師也對佳能表示樂觀，認為隨著市場需求回升，公司未來的獲利表現有望改善。
此外，目前市場上對佳能可能進行的重大股息調整存在不同看法。有專家指出，儘管經濟環境變遷可能影響公司的分紅政策，但若佳能能夠成功應對原材料成本上漲及供應鏈問題，則大幅削減股息的可能性將降低。因此，投資者需密切關注公司接下來的財報及市場動態，以便做出明智的投資決策。

"Sen. John Kennedy Co-sponsors Bill to Address Federal Government Overreach on Farmers, Ranchers and Landowners","Rounds Leads Legislation to Address Federal Government Overreach on South Dakota Farmers, Ranchers and Landowners
WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Mike Rounds (R-S.D.) today reintroduced legislation to address federal government overreach and provide regulatory certainty to South Dakota farmers, ranchers and landowners. The Farmers Freedom Act of 2025 would provide a permanent definition of prior converted cropland (PCC) under the Clean Water Act. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has used this authority to issue Waters of the United States (WOTUS) rulemakings, which regulates navigable waterways in the United States.
For the last several decades, wetlands converted to cropland before 1985 have remained exempt from WOTUS regulation. Under the Biden administration ruling, previously-converted cropland could revert to a wetland status if it becomes unavailable for commodity production due to circumstances like flooding. This causes land to be subject to federal regulation regardless of a previous exemption. To prevent this from happening, Rounds’ legislation would amend the Clean Water Act to allow PCC land to be farmed only once every five years to remain exempt from being regulated under WOTUS.
“South Dakota farmers and ranchers work hard to protect their land, and they don’t need a heavy-handed federal government subjecting them to additional burdensome rule changes,” said Rounds. “While past administrations have issued problematic WOTUS rules, the previous Navigable Waters Protection Rule under the first Trump administration worked to protect owners of prior converted cropland from undue regulation while providing producers with needed flexibility. This legislation seeks to make this definition of PCC permanent, preventing overreach and giving landowners the freedom to use their land how they see fit.”
The Farmers Freedom Act of 2025 is cosponsored by Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) and Senators John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), John Hoeven (R-N.D.) and Roger Marshall (R-Kan.).
This legislation is endorsed by the South Dakota Farm Bureau and the American Farm Bureau.
“Unfortunately, the definition of prior converted cropland (PCC) in the latest WOTUS regulations will only contribute to further uncertainty for producers,” said Scott VanderWal, President of the South Dakota Farm Bureau. “I thank Senator Rounds for introducing legislation to provide flexibility for farmers across South Dakota.”
“Farmers take seriously the responsibility for properly caring for the land they’ve been entrusted with,” said Courtney Briggs, American Farm Bureau’s Senior Director of Government Affairs. “The current rules surrounding prior converted cropland make it difficult for farmers to ensure they are making the best use of their land while protecting the environment. We appreciate Sen. Rounds for working to bring clarity to the PCC exclusion.”
BACKGROUND:
- For the last several decades, wetlands that were drained to be cropland prior to 1985 have remained exempt from regulation under the Clean Water Act.
- In 2015, the Obama administration finalized a rule that expanded the definition of WOTUS, creating confusion and burdensome red tape, especially for South Dakota’s agricultural communities.
- The Trump administration released a proposed rule to replace the 2015 WOTUS rule with a new one that provided much-needed certainty for farmers by establishing clear and reasonable definitions of what qualifies as a “water of the United States.” The Navigable Waters Protection Rule (NWPR) was finalized in 2020.
- The NWPR clarified the rules governing PCC, protecting impacted land from Clean Water Act regulation as long it was used for agricultural purposes once every five years.
- On day one of his administration, President Biden signed an executive order to begin the process of rolling back the Trump administration’s NWPR.
- In December 2022, the EPA issued a new rule repealing the NWPR and changing the definition of WOTUS in a way that will expand federal regulatory authority.
- The Biden administration’s WOTUS rule also tightened the regulations guiding PCC, allowing the federal government to end the exemption for such land immediately upon a change in use.
- In May 2023, the Supreme Court issued a decision in Sackett v. Environmental Protection Agency that overturned the previous 2022 WOTUS rule.

ASHFORD HOSPITALITY TRUST ANNOUNCES PRELIMINARY FIRST QUARTER 2025 RESULTS | AHT Stock News,"- RevPAR increased by 3.2% year-over-year in Q1 2025.
- Consistent monthly RevPAR growth throughout Q1 2025.
- Strong occupancy rate of 68% achieved.
Ashford Hospitality Trust (AHT, Financial), a real estate investment trust focusing on upper-upscale, full-service hotels, has released its preliminary results for the first quarter of 2025. The company reported a notable 3.2% year-over-year increase in Revenue Per Available Room (RevPAR), reaching approximately $133.
Occupancy for the quarter was approximately 68%, with an Average Daily Rate (ADR) of $196. The company attributed its operational success to the ongoing benefits from its GRO AHT initiative, which has positively impacted both top and bottom lines.
Monthly analysis of RevPAR revealed a progressive growth of 3.8% in January, 4.3% in February, but a slowdown to 1.9% in March. Despite this deceleration, Ashford Trust's management remains optimistic about maintaining focus on revenue maximization and expense minimization.
Additionally, Ashford Trust has made strides in extending and refinancing loans, an important strategic move given the current interest rate environment. However, the company has yet to disclose specific financial metrics such as actual revenue, EBITDA, or funds from operations, which are crucial for a leveraged hospitality REIT.
As the company navigates industry uncertainties, these developments suggest a cautious yet forward-thinking approach to sustaining growth in the dynamic upper-upscale segment.",2025-04-17T00:41:22.760+03:00,https://www.gurufocus.com/news/2785295/ashford-hospitality-trust-announces-preliminary-first-quarter-2025-results-aht-stock-news,@gurufocus,positive

Judge orders US to resume grants awarded under Biden-era laws,"WASHINGTON — A federal judge in Rhode Island blocked Trump administration agencies from freezing funds awarded through two high-profile laws enacted during the Biden administration — a bipartisan infrastructure law and a separate climate, tax and health care package.
Judge Mary S. McElroy of the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island on Tuesday ruled in favor of groups that filed a lawsuit last month, after a Trump executive order in January instructed agencies to “immediately pause” the disbursement of funds appropriated via the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act from 2021 and the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.",2025-04-17T00:05:00.000+03:00,https://www.gazettextra.com/news/nation_world/judge-orders-us-to-resume-grants-awarded-under-biden-era-laws/article_1df98782-f342-5d7a-97ae-3e21e3abe9bd.html,Ryan Tarinelli - CQ-Roll Call (TNS),positive

Texas bill increasing public school funding and teacher pay gets initial House approval
Sign up for The Brief, The Texas Tribune’s daily newsletter that keeps readers up to speed on the most essential Texas news.
The Texas House on Wednesday gave initial approval to its priority school funding legislation. In a 144-4 vote, the lower chamber preliminary approved a bill that would increase school districts’ base money per student, raise teacher salaries and limit the use of educators without formal classroom training. House Bill 2 would also improve special education by allocating funding based on the individual needs of children with disabilities.
Republicans, during hours of debate, celebrated the bill as a worthwhile $8 billion investment in public education. Democrats also voiced support for the legislation but argued that it barely scratches the surface of what districts need. Many school districts are currently grappling with challenges ranging from budget deficits and teacher shortages to campus closures.
The bill would notably increase schools’ base funding by $395 — from $6,160 to $6,555. That amount, known as the basic allotment, would automatically go up every two years by tying it to property value growth. Forty-percent of the allotment would go to salaries for school staff. Higher salary increases would go to teachers with more than a decade of classroom experience.
Lawmakers sparred over other aspects of the legislation — from whether the Legislature should continue to invest heavily in compensatory education, which offers support to underserved students at risk of dropping out of school, to how the state should hold charter schools accountable for mismanagement.
Upon final passage, HB 2 will go to the Senate for further consideration. That chamber has already passed a number of similar school funding proposals — though top lawmakers there have expressed opposition to increasing schools' base funding this session.
The basic allotment offers districts flexibility to address the unique needs of their campuses, which includes staff salaries, utilities and maintenance. The Senate has instead advocated for more targeted funding in areas like teacher pay, school security and special education.
The House voted on the bill shortly before taking up legislation that would create school vouchers in Texas, a top priority for Gov. Greg Abbott. Two years ago, public schools missed out on nearly $8 billion, which Abbott held hostage when vouchers failed to gain the support needed to pass then.

J.K. Rowling celebrates after UK Supreme Court rules trans women are not legally women,"‘Proud’ J.K. Rowling celebrates after UK Supreme Court rules trans women are not legally women
J.K. Rowling celebrated after the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom ruled Wednesday that transgender women are not legally women.
“It took three extraordinary, tenacious Scottish women with an army behind them to get this case heard by the Supreme Court and, in winning, they’ve protected the rights of women and girls across the UK,” the “Harry Potter” author, 59, wrote via X.
“@ForWomenScot, I’m so proud to know you.”
Rowling added in another post that she “definitely has” given money to the For Women Scotland organization, which has been “working to protect and strengthen women and children’s rights.”
She also “toasted to” the women of the group and uploaded a photo of two glasses of champagne before announcing, “Think I might be having a cigar later.”
Rowling later argued, “The Supreme Court upheld the rights of women and gay people today.”
However, a trans woman called the “extreme” ruling an “injustice,” elaborating that the court “had a hearing about what rights, what freedoms, what future trans people have… without a single trans person being involved, yet multiple with hate groups.”

She added, “They decided we don’t deserve equality.”
Rowling retorted, “The court clarified that UK women have sex-based rights. You and your fellow activists’ meltdowns are laying bare what has been obvious to a lot of us for years: when you say ‘equality’ you mean ‘women have no right, under any circumstances, to draw boundaries that exclude men.'”
According to the author, the “winners” of the ruling include “women and girls, including trans-identified women (continue to benefit from maternity rights etc), gay people, freedom of speech, freedom of association [and] those at risk of discrimination for a belief in the material reality of sex.”
The court’s five judges agreed in the landmark decision that “the terms ‘woman’ and ‘sex'” under the UK’s 2010 Equality Act “refer to a biological woman and biological sex,” Justice Patrick Hodge said.
The ruling “does not remove protection from trans people,” who are “protected from discrimination on the ground of gender reassignment,” the court confirmed — but a transgender person with documentation recognizing them as female should not be considered a woman for equality purposes.
Rowling has a long history of anti-trans views and even once proclaimed that she would “happily” go to prison for her beliefs.",2025-04-17T00:37:00.000+03:00,https://pagesix.com/2025/04/16/celebrity-news/j-k-rowling-celebrates-after-uk-supreme-court-rules-trans-women-are-not-legally-women,@berniezilio,positive
BHP獲得新南威爾士州批准，Mount Arthur煤礦運營延長至2030年！,"BHP成功獲得新南威爾士州政府批准，將Mount Arthur煤礦的運營期限延長至2030年，同時計劃研究抽水蓄能專案。
BHP於本週三宣佈，公司已獲得新南威爾士州政府的批准，可以將其位於Mount Arthur的熱煤礦運營期延長至2030年。這一決策不僅為BHP提供了更多開採時間，也顯示出該公司在全球能源轉型中的靈活應對能力。
根據BHP的宣告，此次延長將使他們能夠進一步探索和利用煤炭資源，以滿足持續增長的市場需求。此外，BHP還透露將啟動針對抽水蓄能項目的研究，旨在提升可再生能源的儲存及供應能力，這是公司向綠色能源過渡的重要步驟。
雖然環保團體對煤礦擴充套件表示擔憂，但BHP強調此舉符合當前經濟需求，並承諾將遵循嚴格的環境標準以減少影響。未來，隨著全球對清潔能源的需求上升，BHP的雙重策略可能會成為其他企業效仿的範例，促進能源行業的可持續發展。

"Over 175,000 Syrians return home since December: Turkish Minister","Ankara, April 17 (IANS) A total of 175,512 Syrians have voluntarily returned to their country from Turkey since December 9 last year, Turkish Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya said.
According to Yerlikaya on Wednesday, the number of Syrians who have returned from Turkey since 2017 has now reached 915,515.
These returns, comprising 33,730 families, have been carried out in what authorities describe as a “voluntary, safe, dignified, and orderly” manner, Xinhua news agency reported.
Yerlikaya stressed that the return process is managed transparently, with oversight from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).
To facilitate the process, Turkey has introduced measures allowing authorized exit and re-entry and has deployed migration representatives in Syria to monitor and support returnees on the ground.
Millions of Syrians fled their country following the outbreak of civil war in 2011.
Turkey, sharing a long border with Syria, became a major refuge, hosting more than 3.6 million Syrians at the peak of the crisis, according to UN figures.
The Turkish government, which supports the Islamist-led rebels who toppled the government of former President Bashar al-Assad, is hoping to accelerate the return of refugees to ease the tensions their presence has generated in parts of the country.
Overall, around 400,000 Syrians have returned from neighbouring countries since Assad’s fall, according to the UN refugee agency UNHCR.
The agency also said that more than one million Syrians displaced within their country by the conflict had also returned to their homes.
The dramatic shift in Syria’s political landscape began on December 8, 2024, when Bashar al-Assad, who ruled Syria for nearly 25 years, fled to Russia after anti-regime forces seized control of Damascus, effectively ending Baath Party rule that had lasted since 1963.
On January 29, a transitional Syrian administration was announced under the leadership of Ahmed al-Sharaa, the commander of the opposition forces that ousted Assad.
The new administration dissolved Syria’s constitution, security services, armed factions, the Baath Party, and Parliament — setting the stage for a new political structure.

"Modi will set capital construction works in motion on May 2, says Chief Secy. - The Hindu","Andhra Pradesh Chief Secretary K. Vijayanand said on Wednesday that Prime Minister Narendra Modi would be visiting the State to set the capital construction works in motion on May 2.
The Cabinet sub-committee, comprising Ministers Payyavula Keshav, Kollu Ravindra, Y. Satyakumar Yadav, Nadendla Manohar, and P. Narayana, which was constituted to oversee the arrangements for the visit, would be meeting on April 21, he said.
Addressing a meeting to discuss the issue at the Secretariat, Mr. Vijayanand said the place where Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu launched the P-4 initiative was finalised as the venue for the event.
Whether the programme would be held in the morning or evening was yet to be confirmed, he added, and suggested to the officials to make foolproof arrangements for Mr. Modi’s visit.
The Chief Secretary told the officials to take special care of the minimum facilities to be provided in view of the summer and the large crowd expected to assemble there, with due focus on security, as several dignitaries would grace the occasion.
Principal Secretary (GAD) Mukesh Kumar Meena advised the officials to have proper coordination with the Police Department to prevent any untoward incidents, and guidelines would be soon issued to the officials and staff of all the departments.

A New Bill Would Give CO Caregivers the Credit They Deserve,"Family caregiving is an essential job performed with grace and dedication by more than 48 million Americans and 600,000 Coloradans. There is little doubt that each and every American is one or two degrees of separation away from knowing someone who either provides care or receives it.
When medical issues arise, it is often a loved one who steps in to give care and support. Whether it’s household work, traveling to and from doctors’ visits, or cooking and delivering meals, these unpaid caregivers show tremendous compassion and love.
In Colorado, caregivers perform an average of 20 hours of work every week, and they do it for no pay. According to research, the average caregiver spends $7,200 – or more than a quarter of their income – to care for an aging loved one out of their own pocket. These men and women give of themselves in a truly selfless way. Their indispensable role in our society must never be overlooked or forgotten, and we as a nation should do more to support them in every way that we can.
That’s why the newly introduced bill called the Credit for Caring Act deserves immediate consideration in Congress. This bipartisan proposal would provide up to a $5,000 annual tax credit for caregivers. Our senior Senator Michael Bennet is one of the lead sponsors of this legislation. Senator Bennet boldly partnered with West Virginia Senator Shelley Moore Capito and Representatives Linda Sánchez and Mike Carey. It’s a commonsense, compassionate policy – and it’s supported by 84% of voters nationwide.
This year, Congress is set to consider a large tax package, and lawmakers are currently deciding what provisions will be most important to include. Making sure that the Credit for Caring Act is included in that package would be a substantial step toward relieving the financial burden faced by millions of caregivers in our state and across the country.
We are grateful for Senator Bennet’s work on this issue. In addition to leading the Credit for Caring Act, Senator Bennet helped launch and lead the bipartisan Assisting Caregivers Today Caucus, which has members in the Senate and House. Caregiving is a unifying issue at a time when bipartisanship is hard to find. Supporting family caregivers is not only good politics, it has the added benefit of simply being the right thing to do.
Winston Churchill once said, “We make a living by what we get, but we make a life by what we give.” In a nation as wealthy as ours, no one should have to choose between caring for a loved one or affording a quality life for themselves. Congress has the opportunity and duty to act on Senator Bennet’s Credit for Caring Act to give family caregivers the financial help they need.

"UN Deputy: Partnerships, Climate Investment Key | Mirage News","Addressing the opening of an international forum in Hanoi on partnerships for green growth, UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed on Wednesday emphasized the need for accelerated action to meet global climate and development goals.
Marking the tenth anniversary of both the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the landmark Paris Agreement , Ms. Mohammed highlighted the significant progress made over the past decade, while also acknowledging the substantial challenges that remain.
A decade of progress and challenges
In her remarks to the Partnership for growth Summit, known by the shorthand 'P4G', which runs through Thursday in the Viet Nam capital, Ms. Mohammed reflected on the progress achieved since the adoption of the SDGs and the Paris Agreement.
However, she stressed the stark reality that the world is still far from where it needs to be.
""As I speak, there are 750 million people who do not have access to electricity, and two billion people have no clean cooking solutions,"" she stated. She also pointed out the increasing air pollution affecting children worldwide due to fossil fuel emissions.
Hope amid adversity
Despite the daunting statistics, the UN deputy chief expressed hope, drawing inspiration from the words of Vietnamese Zen Master Thich Nhat Hanh: ""Hope is important because it can make the present moment less difficult to bear. If we believe that tomorrow will be better, we can bear a hardship today.""
She identified three sources of hope:
- Global Commitment: The presence of representatives from governments, businesses, investors, and civil society at the summit demonstrated a collective commitment to building more sustainable, resilient, inclusive, and prosperous societies;
- Collaboration: Initiatives like the Just Energy Transition Partnerships and P4G's public-private partnerships, which exemplify the power of collaboration in transforming energy, water, and food systems and;
- Economic Imperatives: The economic benefits of climate action; every dollar invested in climate adaptation can generate a return of up to 10 times.
She also pointed out the significant cost reductions in wind, solar, and battery storage technologies, making them the cheapest sources of new electricity in many markets.
An economic case for climate action
Ms. Mohammed underscored the financial impact of climate disasters, which caused $320 billion in damages worldwide last year.
She emphasized that the climate crisis is draining resources needed for development but also presented a compelling economic case for climate action.
""Renewables accounted for 92.5 per cent of all new power capacity added globally last year, and clean power surpassed 40 per cent of global electricity generation for the first time,"" she noted.
Viet Nam as a leading example
Highlighting Viet Nam's leadership in clean energy, Ms. Mohammed praised the country's bold shift from coal, which is not only combating climate change but also promoting a fairer and more equal future. She called this moment a ""rare opportunity"" to usher in a new economic era that ensures energy access, affordability, and security while creating zero-carbon, disaster-resilient, and sustainable societies.
Call to action
The UN deputy chief urged government leaders to accelerate the implementation of cost-effective solutions and drive change through smart policies and reforms at all levels.
She emphasized the importance of the next round of Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) - national climate action plans - in aligning energy and development plans with climate goals.
""Investment is key,"" she stressed, citing the need for $2.4 trillion per year to flow emerging and developing economies outside China by 2030 to keep the 1.5-degree target within reach and deliver on the SDGs.
Addressing corporate, financial, and civil society leaders, Ms. Mohammed called for continued innovation, collaboration, and the creation of new models and partnerships to mobilize finance at scale. She encouraged leaders to turn obstacles into business opportunities and drive real investments in climate and sustainable development.
In closing, Ms. Mohammed reaffirmed the United Nations' commitment to supporting global efforts towards a more prosperous future for all. ""The United Nations stands ready to support your efforts every step of the way and keep the hope of a more prosperous future for all alive,"" she concluded.

Brian Gould Reviews Humanitarian Aid Mission to Moldova: TruLife Distribution's Commitment to Giving Back | FinancialContent,"FORT LAUDERDALE, FL / ACCESS Newswire / April 16, 2025 / The holiday season often inspires acts of generosity, and Brian Gould, owner of TruLife Distribution, has made it a point to embody that spirit year-round. His most recent commitment to giving back was supporting one of his team members, Jaron Pak, on a critical humanitarian mission to Moldova. The mission focused on aiding vulnerable communities in Eastern Europe, particularly orphans, widows, the elderly, and individuals with disabilities living in war-affected regions.
Gould's decision to back Jaron's mission came naturally, aligning with his long-standing dedication to philanthropy. ""When Jaron shared his plans to help those suffering in Moldova, I immediately saw an opportunity for TruLife to contribute,"" Gould remarked. ""We're not just a business - we're a team that believes in positively impacting the world. This mission was personal, and I knew it was something we could help make happen.""
The Mission: Alleviating Hardship in Moldova
The journey to Moldova was initiated when Jaron Pak connected with Pavel, a Romanian humanitarian aid worker who had spent over three decades building a network of foster homes and feeding centers across Moldova. Pavel's network was working tirelessly to support local communities grappling with the devastating effects of war, poverty, and a broken foster system, exacerbated by the ongoing conflict between Ukraine and Russia.
After learning of the urgent need for resources, particularly food, Jaron decided to raise funds and travel to Moldova to support Pavel's efforts on the ground. With the backing of TruLife Distribution, the mission quickly gained momentum.
A Massive Food Distribution Effort
Between October 24 and November 1, Jaron and an American partner traveled to Moldova to assist in distributing 27.5 tons of essential food supplies to over 15 social houses and feeding centers across southern and eastern Moldova. This enormous effort, more than Pavel had ever distributed before, included staples like:
Carrots
Potatoes
Onions
Biscuits
Cooking oil
Flour
Sugar
Canned pork
Rice
Cornmeal
Butter
Pasta
The impact of the distribution was profound. The supplies were expected to last through March, providing vital sustenance to hundreds of children and families with nowhere else to turn. ""It's incredibly humbling to know that our support is directly improving the lives of so many people facing such dire circumstances,"" Gould shared.
Extending Support Beyond Food
Recognizing the community's broader needs, Jaron and his team also provided significant donations of school supplies and winter boots. Despite their difficulties, these contributions helped ensure that the children could attend school during the cold winter months. The donations, including items necessary for their education and mobility, will be invaluable in allowing the children to maintain stability and continuity in their education.
The team's work in Moldova is far from over. Due to the ongoing demand for resources, Jaron plans to return to continue his efforts, ensuring that the network of social houses and feeding centers in Moldova receives sustained support.
TruLife's Dedication to Making a Difference
Supporting humanitarian missions like this is nothing new for TruLife Distribution . Still, it was significant for Brian Gould to back a project led by one of his team members. ""It's rare to have the opportunity to make such a direct and tangible difference in the lives of so many,"" Gould said. ""It's not just about running a business - it's about creating a company culture where giving back is as important as our daily work.""
TruLife's mission to Moldova reflects the broader ethos that Gould has instilled in the company: a commitment to social responsibility alongside business success. While the team focuses on expanding health and wellness brands within the U.S., their dedication to global humanitarian efforts shows that their influence extends beyond the marketplace.
""I'm so proud of Jaron and everyone who supported this mission,"" Gould concluded. ""At TruLife, we believe in using our resources and talents to improve lives, whether through business endeavors or by supporting causes that make the world a better place.""

Rice says Arsenal 'fully believe' in Champions League hopes,"Declan Rice has said Arsenal ‘fully believe’ the club can win the Champions League this season.
Arsenal progressed into the Champions League semi-finals for the first time since 2008/09 after beating Real Madrid at the Bernabeu on Wednesday evening.
Writing the next chapter – TOGETHER 👊 pic.twitter.com/wnVxePE2sY
— Arsenal (@Arsenal) April 16, 2025
Goals from Bukayo Saka and Gabriel Martinelli secured a 2-1 win in the Spanish capital and an emphatic 5-1 aggregate win.
Arsenal have eliminated the holders in convincing fashion and will now take on Paris Saint-Germain for a place in the final. Rice believes the Gunners are on the verge of something special and said there is a real belief within the squad that the North Londoners can win the Champions League for the first time this season.
“I sensed it when I signed, we were on an upward trajectory for the club,” he reflected to TNT Sports.
“It’s been tough in the Premier League, but in this competition we’ve done exceptionally well. We all fully believe it. We’ve got full trust in this manager, he’s unbelievable. We’ve got young lads who really want it as well. We just want to take tonight in, take it one step at a time. We’ve got PSG next, who are an amazing team.”
Rice scored twice in the first leg and claimed the man-of-the-match award in the Bernabeu. The England midfielder hailed the performance from Arsenal, on a ‘historic night’ for the club.
“Back-to-back [Player of the Match awards]. It’s such a special night for this club, it’s a historic night for this club. We have an objective in this competition, we want to play the best teams. We want to win this competition.
“There was a lot of talk about [Madrid] coming back, because they’ve come back so many times before, but we had a lot of confidence about coming here and winning the game. We knew we were going to suffer, but we knew we were going to win. We did it in real life. What a night for the club.”

Colombia obtuvo préstamos por 3.800 millones de dólares en el mercado de capitales | Noticias RCN,"Colombia obtuvo préstamos por 3.800 millones de dólares en el mercado de capitales
Aunque es una buena noticia para financiar las obligaciones fiscales de 2025, expertos advierten por los altos intereses de esta deuda.

El Gobierno colombiano logró una exitosa emisión de bonos en el mercado de capitales. Los inversionistas le prestaron al país 3.800 millones de dólares que servirán para financiar parte de los compromisos fiscales adquiridos por la nación.
En total fueron dos emisiones de bonos globales, ambas por 1.900 millones de dólares. El compromiso fue pagar la primera en el año 2030, mientras que la segunda quedó a 2035.
Esta operación es un préstamo que hace el Gobierno a inversionistas internacionales sobre unas tasas de interés, con el objetivo de financiar el presupuesto de 2025.
Preocupan los altos intereses de estos bonos
Para los expertos, la buena noticia es que Colombia haya logrado conseguir ese dinero en el mercado internacional. Sin embargo, la preocupación radica en que los préstamos se hicieron en dólares y con tasas entre 7,5% y 8,7%.
Lo que llama la atención es que estas tasas impuestas por el mercado son mucho más altas que las que se venían aplicando, y son puestas usualmente a países con calificación de deuda mucho menor a la de Colombia.
Expertos señalan que, en el futuro, la calificación crediticia de Colombia podría bajar.
Por otro lado, aseguran que emitir más deuda en dólares podría significar más costos dentro de los años siguientes.
Así se consiguieron los bonos globales
El Ministerio de Hacienda informó que la transacción “contó con una porción de manejo de pasivos que mitiga el riesgo de refinanciamiento y contribuye a mejorar el perfil de la deuda externa”.
Además, el ministro, Germán Ávila, exaltó que la demanda que atrajo estas operaciones demuestra el compromiso del Gobierno con la diversificación del portafolio de inversionistas internacionales y del manejo de las finanzas públicas del país.

GOP Reps: No Medicaid Cuts for Vulnerable Populations,"House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and several other House Republican leaders are on the receiving end of a letter from a group of GOP House members warning they won’t accept Medicaid program cuts that affect “vulnerable populations.”
Rep. Nick LaLota, R-N.Y., is one of the members who signed on to the letter. He also posted the letter for his constituents to view. LaLota said the House members behind the communication to leadership are together in their position that while some programming may need to be revised, slashing coverage for the vulnerable is not something they’ll accept.
LaLota wrote, “That’s why I joined my colleagues in calling on House GOP leadership to protect Medicaid coverage while pursuing commonsense reforms. These include work requirements for able-bodied adults, limiting benefits to legal residents, and increasing eligibility checks from every 12 months to every six months to help prevent fraud and abuse.”
The letter reminded House leadership that support from rural districts across America and those with large populations of the elderly is how the Republicans reached their current standing and that should not be forgotten during the budget debate.
“As Members of Congress who helped to deliver a Republican majority, many of us representing districts with high rates of constituents who depend on Medicaid, we would like to reiterate our strong support for this program that ensures our constituents have reliable healthcare,” the letter read.

Ley firmada por Gavin Newsom en California que permitirá a ciertos residentes obtener licencia remunerada,"Ley firmada por Gavin Newsom en California que permitirá a ciertos residentes obtener licencia remunerada
El gobernador Gavin Newsom firma la AB 2123, que pocos conocen y que transforma el acceso a la licencia familiar remunerada (PFL) en California, beneficiando a los cuidadores de familiares gravemente enfermos.
El gobernador Gavin Newsom aprobó la AB 2123, una legislación que transforma el acceso a la licencia familiar remunerada (PFL) en California. La ley, impulsada por la asambleísta Diane Papan, exime a los trabajadores de usar hasta dos semanas de su tiempo de vacaciones antes de recibir los beneficios del PFL.
Este cambio ofrece un respaldo concreto a los cuidadores de Estados Unidos, especialmente aquellos que deben atender a familiares con enfermedades graves como la ELA. Al eliminar esta exigencia, se protege a quienes viven de sueldo a sueldo y se facilita el uso del tiempo libre remunerado sin afectar sus derechos laborales.

¿Cuál es el principal cambio que introduce la ley AB 2123 para los cuidadores?
La AB 2123, firmada por Gavin Newsom, modifica un aspecto clave de la política de licencia familiar remunerada (PFL): ya no obliga a los trabajadores a consumir previamente hasta dos semanas de su tiempo de vacaciones antes de acceder a los beneficios del programa. Esta modificación permite que los empleados con responsabilidades de cuidado tomen hasta ocho semanas de licencia sin que eso implique perder sus días de descanso.
Gracias a esta reforma, los empleados podrán enfocarse en brindar el cuidado necesario sin comprometer su bienestar laboral o económico. Además, este avance fortalece el papel de los cuidadores dentro del sistema de salud de California, al reconocer su aporte indispensable. Con esta medida, se prioriza el equilibrio entre vida laboral y familiar, y se ofrece mayor apoyo a las familias que dependen de un solo ingreso o viven de sueldo a sueldo, brindándoles mayor seguridad y estabilidad en momentos de crisis.4o

La nueva normativa se alinea con los valores que Gavin Newsom ha promovido durante su mandato, centrados en la equidad, la justicia social y el fortalecimiento del tejido familiar en California.

﻿中國老牌跨境電商敦煌網在美爆紅,"圖：中國跨境電商敦煌網（DHgate）官網。\網絡圖片
　　美國總統特朗普大幅徵收對中國產品的關稅，引發美民眾焦慮，擔憂衣食住行全部漲價。中國老牌跨境電商平台敦煌網（DHgate）近期在美國社交媒體上走紅。截至當地時間4月15日，敦煌網的應用程式在美國蘋果商店下載量已位居總榜第二，僅次於ChatGPT。美國居民Janine向大公報表示，她已下載了敦煌網準備使用。
　　【大公報訊】美國白宮15日已宣布，對部分中國進口商品關稅最高達245%，並於5月2日起取消小額包裹關稅豁免。自從特朗普宣布對中國徵收對等關稅以來，憂心日用品加價的美國民眾開始大量囤積中國商品。
　　許多中國供應商和製造商在短視頻平台TikTok分享視頻，介紹「世界工廠」中國的代工模式，吸引外國消費者「從源頭買好貨」。這些視頻揭秘，大量知名品牌的服裝、手袋和其他配飾的生產地源自中國，通過中國的跨境電商網站，即可直接下單購買產品。這大大提升了中國跨境電商平台近期的熱度，被稱為「小黃App」的老牌電商敦煌網意外爆紅，成為美國近期最多下載量的應用程式之一。
　　下載量暴增940% 排名第二
　　敦煌網成立於2004年，專注於小額B2B交易，是美國市場最大的中國跨境B2B電商平台之一。該平台擁有超過260萬家註冊商家，覆蓋約 200個國家和地區，在線產品數量超3300萬，涵蓋電子產品、家居和玩具、鞋服、珠寶、健康和美容等。
　　應用數據提供商Appfigures顯示，4月11日，敦煌網在美國非遊戲類免費iPhone應用排行榜上僅第352位，卻在13日躍升至第6位，14日升至第2位。
　　據統計，敦煌網13日在iOS平台的下載量驟增至11.75萬次，較30日均值暴漲732%。其中，美國市場的下載量達到6.51萬次，較前一個月激增940%。截至4月15日，敦煌網在美國地區蘋果商店下載量已位於總榜第二，僅次於Chat GPT，超越 TikTok、Instagram等全球熱門應用程式。
　　此外，中國購物軟件在美國地區蘋果App Store的熱度也隨之高漲。在購物類軟件中，敦煌網、淘寶和SHEIN在4月16日成為下載量排名前三的免費iPhone應用程序。　　
　　美國亞利桑那州居民Janine向大公報記者表示，她是一個中國跨境電商平台的「狂熱愛好者」，過去經常使用快時尚零售商SHEIN購買衣服，最近則更多使用拼多多旗下的海外電平台Temu以及阿里巴巴。她表示，最喜歡使用Temu，「因為尺碼更加準確」。Janine表示，隨着敦煌網近日爆紅，自己也下載了這個平台的軟件，正打算使用敦煌網購買價格更便宜的衣服。
　　 揭「品牌溢價的真相」
　　分析指出，特朗普不斷加碼關稅，以及TikTok上的火爆影片，共同推動了敦煌網的爆紅。TikTok上這些熱門影片點出了「品牌溢價的真相」，歐美銷售許多名牌包都是在中國製造，實際成本低廉，而這些包隨後被送到品牌在歐洲的工廠，貼上品牌logo標籤並重新包裝，使這些包成為「意大利製造」或「法國製造」，並以相當高的價格出售。還有影片指出，一件售價100美元的Lululemon瑜伽服，在中國工廠製造時的實際成本只有5到6美元。在美國售價超過300美元的連帽衫，在中國的製作成本僅為10美元。
　　美媒指出，中國工廠為西方知名品牌生產許多產品，它們的價格可能遠高於製造成本，部分原因是工廠、物流中間商、品牌標籤和零售商都獲利。特朗普屢次聲稱巨大貿易逆差讓美國「吃虧」，實際巨額利潤仍被美國企業掌控。
　　不過，美國計劃從5月2日起取消小額包裹關稅豁免，通過敦煌網直接從中國購買便宜的衣物仍可能面臨關稅問題。然而即便算上關稅，這些商品依然要比在美銷售品牌貨便宜許多。彭博社報道，敦煌網上周向商戶發出了「關稅護航計劃」的公開信，承諾為商戶提供支持。

Construye Bien: cerca de una década impulsando la seguridad en las viviendas peruanas,"Construye Bien, una plataforma impulsada por Sodimac y Maestro, nació con el propósito de concientizar, educar y asesorar a los peruanos sobre la importancia de una construcción segura. Desde sus inicios, hace casi una década, el programa ha ido evolucionando y creciendo de manera constante, llegando cada vez a más hogares. Hoy en día, impacta a miles de personas brindando la información necesaria, promoviendo prácticas de construcción responsable y el uso de materiales adecuados para reducir la vulnerabilidad de las viviendas.
“Construye Bien ha sido una plataforma clave en la educación sobre construcción segura en el Perú. Nuestro objetivo es seguir promoviendo, en alianza con las marcas líderes del mercado, el acceso a información confiable y asesoría técnica para que cada vez más peruanos construyan con seguridad y reduzcan los riesgos ante un desastre. Este compromiso es permanente y seguiremos trabajando para impulsar la formalización y el acceso a mejores prácticas”, destacó Piero Campos, Gerente Comercial de Sodimac Perú.
Acompáñanos a conocer su historia y sus principales iniciativas:
2017 - Nacimiento de Construye Bien
Ante la alta tasa de viviendas autoconstruidas en el país, que el 2017, según Cámara Peruana de la Construcción (Capeco), solo en Lima llegaba al 70%, nació Construye Bien, una iniciativa pensada para capacitar a maestros de obra, autoconstructores y propietarios, asegurando que las edificaciones cumplan con los estándares de seguridad estructural.
2018 - El impacto de la “Prueba Maestra”
La plataforma marcó un hito en la concientización sobre los riesgos de la construcción informal con la “Prueba Maestra”. Este desafío consistió en someter una vivienda edificada con buenas prácticas y otra informal a movimientos similares a los generados por un sismo de gran magnitud. Mientras la primera se mantuvo en pie, la informal colapsó completamente. El experimento se realizó con el apoyo de instituciones especializadas como el Instituto Geofísico del Perú (IGP), la Cámara Peruana de la Construcción (CAPECO) y el Centro de Estudios y Prevención de Desastres (PREDES).
2019-2022 - Expansión digital: conectando con más peruanos
Con el objetivo de llegar a más peruanos, Construye Bien reforzó su presencia en plataformas digitales y redes sociales. Mediante videos y materiales gráficos, lograron educar al público de manera más ágil y dinámica.
Sodimac y Maestro reafirmaron su compromiso con la seguridad enfocándose en tres aspectos clave:
2023 - Construye Bien inicia una nueva etapa
Sodimac y Maestro reafirmaron su compromiso con la construcción segura al relanzar la plataforma Construye Bien y presentar a la Brigada Construye Bien, un equipo de cuatro expertos que enseñaban a resolver los problemas que amenazan la integridad de las viviendas y las familias peruanas.
La brigada se enfocó en cuatro áreas clave:
“Todos somos Brigada Construye bien”
En septiembre de 2023, Sodimac y Maestro lanzaron la iniciativa “Todos Somos Brigada Construye Bien”, con la finalidad de capacitar a la población sobre la preparación, respuesta y rehabilitación de los potenciales daños que pudiera causar en las viviendas el Fenómeno El Niño.
Gracias a esta iniciativa, se brindaron talleres de capacitación y videos tutoriales sobre la protección de los hogares ante inundaciones, filtraciones y deslizamientos.
2024-2025 - El regreso de la “Prueba Maestra”
Frente al riesgo sísmico que enfrenta Perú, y considerando que cerca del 76% de las viviendas podrían no soportar un terremoto, la “Prueba Maestra” de Construye Bien regresó para reforzar el mensaje sobre la importancia de una construcción segura.
Esta prueba volvió en un nuevo formato, adaptado a las plataformas digitales, y con una estrategia más interactiva.
Construye bien: compromiso consolidado
A lo largo de estos años, Sodimac y Maestro han asumido un rol activo en la concientización sobre la construcción segura, siempre alineados a la formalización del sector. Con ello, ha impulsado a Construye Bien a adaptarse a las cambiantes necesidades del mercado y de la población. Actualmente, la plataforma aplica nuevas estrategias para lograr un impacto real en la seguridad estructural del país.
Lucha contra la informalidad
Este 2025, Construye Bien también viene combatiendo la informalidad y el uso de los productos ‘bamba’, trabajando para demostrar la importancia de adquirir materiales de calidad y así proteger la vivienda y la integridad familiar.

Perú y Suiza concretan renegociación de convenio para eliminar doble tributación,"Este miércoles 16 de abril se dio por terminada la renegociación del convenio para Eliminar la Doble Tributación (CDI), relacionados con los Impuestos sobre la Renta y Patrimonio, suscrito entre el Ministerio de Economía y Finanzas (MEF) con la Confederación Suiza y cuya vigencia data de 2012.
Según informaron desde la cartera, esta renegociación permitirá incorporar al CDI con Suiza una norma antiabuso general denominada Test del Propósito Principal. Esta permitirá contrarrestar esquemas de elusión fiscal como el “treaty shopping”, uno de los mecanismos más utilizados de evasión fiscal.
“Asimismo, tras llegar a un acuerdo con Suiza, se permitirá la resolución de forma eficiente y oportuna de las controversias sobre interpretación o aplicación de las disposiciones del convenio”, complementaron en un comunicado.

Aunque no hay una fecha precisa, se espera firmar este convenio próximamente, a fin de aplicarlo en ambos países una vez que hayan concluido los procedimientos requeridos por sus legislaciones internas para que entre en vigor.
Como se sabe, un CDI es un tratado bilateral que establece cómo cada país gravará las rentas transfronterizas, como evitará la elusión y evasión fiscal y cómo brindará alivio contra la doble tributación, estableciendo límites, en este caso, sobre cómo Perú y Suiza pueden gravar las rentas transfronterizas como los dividendos, intereses y regalías.",2025-04-17T00:32:00.000+03:00,https://gestion.pe/economia/peru-y-suiza-concretan-renegociacion-de-convenio-para-eliminar-doble-tributacion-noticia,Redacción Gestión,positive
New legislation tackles deceptive wood marketing,"The Missouri General Assembly has introduced legislation this session to combat misleading or deceptive practices related to the wood industry.
SB 760, carried by Senator Jamie Burger and HB 1537, carried by Representative Tony Harbison, both aim to stop sellers from selling products they claim are wood, when in reality the product is synthetic wood.
One of the biggest reasons behind the bill is to help protect Missouri’s wood industry.
While not often thought of when it comes to Missouri’s agricultural industries, the forest industry is much larger than the average Missourian might think. Missouri’s forest products are valued at $10 billion dollars and the industry employs over 42,000 Missourians across the state. This includes sawmill workers, lumber workers and even flooring producers.
According to Missouri Forest Products Association Executive Director Brian Brookshire, when these sellers use deceptive tactics to market their products as real wood to consumers, it can seriously affect the entire forest products industry in the state. But he says it can also harm consumers.
“These bills represent a victory, both for the forest products industry in the state of Missouri and most importantly, consumers,” Brookshire said. “Knowing the difference between real hardwood and synthetic wood products will allow Missouri consumers to make informed decisions and support a state-wide, multi-billion dollar industry.”
According to Brookshire, when consumers get duped into buying synthetic wood products instead of real wood products, they are unknowingly settling for lower quality, harming their projects and in some cases, even risking their health.
The most common and easy-to-understand example of this issue is the flooring market.
There are vast differences between synthetic wood flooring and real wood flooring. Although usually cheaper, synthetic wood flooring is not as durable as wood and will significantly degrade over time. Wood flooring can also increase the value of a house. Wood flooring is also obviously made of wood, meaning it is completely sustainable and can easily be turned into other products later on. Whereas synthetic wood flooring is often not recyclable and has to be burned, which can be harmful to the environment. According to the EPA, wood flooring is also better for your health since synthetic flooring is more likely to harbor dangerous microorganisms and allergens.
But for Brookshire, it’s more than knowing the difference between the two products. According to him, consumers should have the right to choose what they buy, but they also deserve the right to know what they are buying when they buy it, not when problems crop up in the future.
He believes these bills are a good way to help stop this issue.
Specifically, these bills would bar “any person advertising or selling wood products” from “misrepresenting a product as a wood product if the product is not derived or harvested from wood”, protecting both the industry and the consumer from deceptive marketing tactics.
Currently, both bills have been referred to committee.",2025-04-17T00:38:00.000+03:00,https://themissouritimes.com/new-legislation-tackles-deceptive-wood-marketing,The Missouri Times,positive

Tras unos minutos de incertidumbre, con la vista puesta en el cielo, los titulares de esta emblemática cofradía, fundada en 1983, asomaron por el portón del guardapasos. La procesión dio comienzo a las 19.25 horas, casi media hora más tarde de lo previsto, el tiempo suficiente para que las nubes se dispersaran. Fueron recibidos con aplausos emocionados por la multitud de fieles que se congregó en la calle Quevedo, después de que las inclemencias meteorológicas frustraran la estación de penitencia de 2024.Tras la cruz de guía, comenzó la salida de los hermanos, ataviados con su reconocible túnica blanca y fajín granate.

台媒三立新聞4月14日報導， 美中關稅戰 給台灣代工業帶來轉單商機。專做消費性 電子產品 的代工大廠表示，過往美國客戶只給台灣20%的訂單，如今將超過5成的中國產線都轉給了台灣。
報導說，以前在中國生產成本比台灣低，美國客戶幾乎將大筆訂單都給中國，但川普的145%關稅讓品牌商吃不消，他們紛紛開始拚轉單。舉例說，美國牌的電子書閱讀器原本100%都選中國組裝，現在70%到80%的代工轉向台灣，大陸只剩2到3成。
代工廠訂單變多了，開始積極徵才，希望快速消化訂單。
除了電子產品，台灣醫療大廠也坦言，客戶針對不少MIT的醫材的詢問度也在增高。

"Philadelphia Housing Authority to preserve, build 20K units - WHYY","From Philly and the Pa. suburbs to South Jersey and Delaware, what would you like WHYY News to cover? Let us know!
The Philadelphia Housing Authority is set to play a major role in Mayor Cherelle Parker’s push to create and preserve 30,000 units of housing during her first term.
Under an ambitious plan of its own, PHA will remake its entire public housing portfolio while adding thousands more subsidized units through new construction projects and the acquisition of privately held properties.
In all, the housing authority plans to preserve, redevelop, build or acquire roughly 20,000 units over eight years — an estimated $6.3 billion investment amid a deepening affordable housing crisis. And it’s expected that all of these units will be counted under the Parker administration’s $2 billion housing proposal , dubbed the Housing Opportunities Made Easy, or H.O.M.E., initiative. WHYY thanks our sponsors — become a WHYY sponsor
“PHA is coordinating and working in tandem with the Parker administration’s H.OM.E initiative that is addressing overall the city’s housing crisis,” said PHA President Kelvin Jeremiah during a recent news briefing at the authority’s North Philadelphia headquarters.
Jessie Lawrence, director of the city’s Department of Planning and Development, called PHA a “key partner” in the administration’s housing plan.
“However, in no way does PHA’s plans mean that the Parker administration is changing any of the programs, initiatives, and investments outlined in our proposed $2 billion H.O.M.E. housing plan,” Lawrence said in a statement.
The housing authority is calling its strategy the “Opening Doors” initiative. It was launched last January but was detailed for the first time Monday — about two months after the Parker administration formally launched the H.O.M.E. initiative, a multipronged proposal rooted in a promise made on the campaign trail.
Under PHA’s plan, the authority expects to spend $3.8 billion to modernize and redevelop roughly 13,000 units of conventional public housing, the majority of which are more than 70 years old. All of these units will also be converted to Section 8 housing, a designation that generally comes with more stable funding and helps ensure long-term affordability.
Jeremiah estimated that another $2.5 billion will be needed to build or acquire roughly 7,000 more units, bringing the grand total to about 20,000. PHA’s so-called “Faircloth Limit” — the number of public housing units for which the agency can receive capital and operating funds — sits just above 21,000 units.
Short-term rentals in Wilmington are in the crosshairs as city officials work to solve the affordable housing crisis. The housing authority has more than 100,000 residents across its various waiting lists .
“We know by now that there is an affordable housing crisis that the city is confronting, and as a result, we want to position ourselves, and have positioned ourselves, to address that very issue,” Jeremiah said. A flexible plan
The initiative gets underway at a time of great uncertainty for housing authorities across the country, including PHA.
President Donald Trump has spent his months in office making drastic cuts to a variety of departments within the federal government as part of a broader effort to make it more efficient. That includes the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, where the administration has so far cut staff, canceled contracts and frozen funding . WHYY thanks our sponsors — become a WHYY sponsor
It is unclear if PHA, which receives 93% of its funding from HUD, will face severe funding cuts in the near future. Jeremiah told reporters the “Opening Doors” initiative will proceed regardless, even if it means the plan needs to be adjusted in response to “some belt tightening” or tariffs that further raise the cost of construction.
The plan, for example, may be shifted to include more acquisitions because those units are considerably cheaper than newly constructed units. A new unit costs PHA about $550,000 to build, while acquiring a unit costs about $225,000.
Jeremiah added the housing authority has done nothing that would draw the ire of the president.
“PHA, more than any housing authority in the country, reflects a lot of the values the Trump administration has been espousing. The fact is that we are managing this housing authority within the resources. We’ve taken a lot of steps to address in the past the structural deficit. The waste and mismanagement that existed no longer exists,” Jeremiah said.
To finance the initiative, the housing authority plans to leverage existing authority funding while also seeking a combination of public and private sources. The list includes Low Income Housing Tax Credits and CHOICE Neighborhoods grants , as well as tax-exempt bonds and private mortgage financing.
Jeremiah said he would also welcome funding from the city and state. Unlike many other places, neither contributes directly to the housing authority.
“All across the country, municipalities are stepping up because they understand, as we do, that housing is an essential need and that it provides a basis and a platform upon which we can address a whole host of social ills,” Jeremiah said.
The “one-stop-shop” program that coordinates home repair, energy efficiency and solar for low-income homeowners could be at risk. To date, a total of 8,772 units are either completed, under construction or in the pipeline, according to a public-facing dashboard PHA created to track the initiative’s progress. About $2 billion has either been spent or allocated for those units. More than 1,000 of those units were acquired by PHA. That includes 231 units at The Dane Apartments in Wynnefield and 360 units at Brith Sholom House in Wynnefield Heights, which the authority purchased last year after years of turmoil under previous ownership. The agency has also purchased four properties in Germantown , totaling 381 units. Jeremiah, who said countless developers have reached out to PHA about an acquisition deal, says the goal is to enable low-income residents to live in what he is calling “non-traditional” neighborhoods — neighborhoods that PHA tenants have historically not been able to access. PHA has so far preserved another 1,193 scattered sites and started redeveloping some of its “obsolete” public housing sites, including Bartram Village in Southwest Philadelphia. Over the course of five phases, the agency will build 688 mixed-income units with the help of Low Income Housing Tax Credits and a $50 million Choice Neighborhood Implementation Grant. The authority also plans to overhaul Westpark Apartments in University City, which will include rehabbing all three of the site’s high-rises. “It does not make sense for us to just build because it’s not something that we can do to get ourselves out of the housing crisis,” Jeremiah said. “We have to preserve the existing portfolio and that means that we have to raise money to invest in it.” “There isn’t going to be a savior. We’ve been waiting for one for the last 25 years. One hasn’t come yet.”",2025-04-17T00:48:15.832+03:00,https://whyy.org/articles/philadelphia-housing-authority-affordable-units-opening-doors,Aaron Moselle,positive

中马民心相通根植于历史|东盟_新浪财经_新浪网,"本报记者 白波
中国驻马来西亚大使欧阳玉靖近日接受本报记者专访时表示，两国领导人的频繁互动为中马关系发展提供了根本遵循。近年来两国各领域合作成果丰硕，马来西亚民调显示，77%的马来西亚人对中国抱有好感。中国将坚定支持马来西亚担任2025年东盟轮值主席国，坚持与东盟并肩前行，构建更紧密的中国—东盟命运共同体。
欧阳玉靖表示，中马关系历经半个多世纪风雨仍历久弥新、历久弥坚。回首建交之初，马方领导人曾用“新生的小树”比喻中马关系，现如今，中马关系已茁壮成长为一棵根深叶茂、花繁果硕的参天大树。中马两国正携手朝着命运与共的未来大踏步前进。
近年来两国领导人往来密切，马来西亚总理安瓦尔在不到20个月里三次访华。欧阳玉靖说，两国领导人的频繁互动、掌舵领航为推动中马关系发展提供了根本遵循。我们要在两国领导人掌舵领航下，汲取历史经验，赓续传统友好，继续做世代友好的亲密邻居、携手发展的真诚伙伴、情同手足的知心朋友、共促和平的重要力量，打造中马关系更加灿烂的明天。
中国已连续16年成为马来西亚最大贸易伙伴国，2024年双边贸易达到2120.4亿美元，同比增长11.4%，创历史新高。马来西亚是中国在东盟中的第二大贸易伙伴和第一大进口来源国。
马来西亚也是中国在全球的重要直接投资目的地国之一，双方新质生产力合作势头迅猛。中国新能源汽车在马广受好评，吉利、奇瑞等汽车企业在马投资设厂，促进两国产供链深度融合。万国数据、秦淮数据等公司建设的数据中心拔地而起，中国技术和中国方案正助力马来西亚成为地区数字经济领导者，实现数字化转型目标。
欧阳玉靖介绍，中马以人文交流为纽带，建设民心相通的命运共同体。他表示，中马民心相通根植于历史，淬炼于时代风浪。郑和七下西洋、五次驻节马六甲的故事，在马来西亚家喻户晓。中马建交半个多世纪以来，两国人民携手应对印度洋海啸、汶川地震和新冠疫情，情谊愈发坚固。
2023年底，中马两国开始实行互免签证政策。2024年全年共有近380万人次中国游客来马，每周往返于两国之间的航班有500多架次，与马来西亚赴华游客数量一同超越疫情前水平。
马来西亚是2025年东盟轮值主席国，提出了“包容和永续”的东盟主题。欧阳玉靖说，中国将坚定支持马来西亚履职，坚持与东盟并肩前行，构建更为紧密的中国—东盟命运共同体，共建和平、安宁、繁荣、美丽、友好家园。
欧阳玉靖提出，两国未来要深化政治互信，支持东盟中心地位，弘扬和平共处五项原则和万隆精神，尊重各自发展道路，共同维护亚洲价值观。今年，马来西亚倡议召开首次中国—东盟—海合会峰会，推动构建跨区域合作架构，中方愿积极参与，推动三方合作更好地造福地区人民。
中国—东盟具有20亿人口超大市场优势，加快签署和实施中国—东盟3.0版自贸协定，全面发挥《区域全面经济伙伴关系协定》（RCEP）作用，携手推动经济增长，扩大新兴产业合作，将对世界贸易稳定、经济繁荣发挥重大作用。
继续办好中国—东盟人文交流年，加强文化、旅游、青年、媒体、智库等交流合作，增加中国—东盟菁英奖学金名额，探索实现更高水平的双向开放，将推动文明互鉴、促进民心相通。

以文化创新书写城市发展新篇章--广东省深圳市以文化强市建设让人民生活更美好 _光明网,"点击右上角微信好友

光明日报记者 党文婷 严圣禾
春日清晨的广东深圳湾畔，微风拂面，不少身着运动衣的年轻人在轻快地晨跑。不远处，阳光静静照进24小时书吧，几位读者坐在窗前晨读。而在深港国际影视后期制作基地内，特效师们已开始新一天的工作，为即将上映的国产影片打磨特效镜头……忙碌中带有惬意，这是深圳文化生活的日常剪影。
习近平总书记指出，以文化人、以文惠民、以文润城、以文兴业，展现城市文化特色和精神气质，是传承发展城市文化、培育滋养城市文明的目的所在。
近年来，深圳将文化新质生产力作为经济增长新引擎，推动公共文化服务从“普惠覆盖”向“精准供给”升级，让文化空间成为基层治理的柔性载体，为超大城市发展提供了“以文化促治理、以文化育产业、以文化塑认同”的深圳实践。深圳，这座中国改革开放的“窗口”城市，正以城市文化书写“高质量文化强市”的全新篇章。

文化新质生产力：从影视特效到文化保护
深圳龙岗区的一栋现代化办公楼里，深圳洛克特视效科技有限公司创始人聂华军带领团队为即将上线的电影反复打磨特效镜头。刚刚过去的春节档大热现象级电影《哪吒之魔童闹海》（以下简称《哪吒2》），有不少特效出自这个团队。
“像敖闰的‘裂空爪’特效，我们做了八层不同材质、不同速度的岩浆流体，反复修改了六七十遍。”聂华军介绍，“为了适应IMAX大屏幕，《哪吒2》的特效制作难度是《哪吒1》的三到五倍。”
这家深圳企业参与了“哪吒”系列电影长达10年的制作历程。在《哪吒2》中，他们承担了极具挑战性的特效设计工作，仅特效测试模拟缓存量就累计达10TB以上。
“每个镜头至少有5种特效元素，数亿颗粒子的运动轨迹都要精确控制。”技术总监指着屏幕上飞舞的沙石说，既要保证视觉冲击力，又要符合物理规律。
如今，深圳的数字文化产业为中国影视工业注入活力。在龙岗区，像洛克特视效科技有限公司这样的影视企业超过200家，形成完整的产业链条。深港国际影视后期制作基地入驻率超80%，一部国产电影从前期拍摄到后期制作，总能在各个环节找到深圳企业的身影——瑞云科技开发的云渲染技术，能同时调度上万台服务器进行协同工作，让处理5亿粒子量的星云场景成为可能；华强方特开发的瀑布制作流程自动化程序，将50台高性能工作站整合成解算集群，创造出令人惊叹的视觉效果。
据统计，2024年深圳市规模以上文化及相关产业法人单位3754家，实现营业收入约12875亿元，同比增长约12%，显示出文化产业发展的强大动力。此外，深圳还率先探索文化与科技融合的有效机制，新型文化业态不断涌现。
在数字技术加持下的文化新质生产力，不仅催生了影视、游戏等领域的新业态，也在拓展文化保护领域边界。
深圳的腾讯SSV数字文化实验室与四川省文物考古研究院文物保护与修复研究中心合作，通过视觉技术和AI生成技术，帮助后者实现出土文物碎片的虚拟拼接、矫形和复原。这一举措突破文物修复技术瓶颈，让考古工作者有机会与几千年前的历史对话。
甲骨文研究也因AI技术迎来突破。2024年5月，腾讯公司与安阳师范学院等单位成立“数字甲骨共创中心”，利用AI微痕增强技术，建成覆盖143万字的全球最大甲骨文单字数据库。如今，无论是研究人员还是古文化爱好者，打开“了不起的甲骨文”微信小程序，均可用手机学习甚至破译甲骨文。
而在近年红红火火的文创产业领域，深圳企业同样表现亮眼。走进创新微越工艺礼品有限公司，设计师们在紧锣密鼓地设计文创产品，以期能在今年端午节和暑期实现量产上市。据了解，故宫博物院、哈尔滨冰雪大世界、青海茶卡盐湖、新疆阿勒泰……游客们在许多知名景区和博物馆购买的网红文创，不少是“深圳制造”。
“深圳对文创产业的大力扶持，加上文博会等优质平台，为我们提供了广阔的展示空间与多元化的合作机遇。”创新微越负责人韩万里说。
公共文化服务：从“有温度”到“懂人心”
“家门口的文化活动越来越多，内容和载体也更丰富了。”这是许多深圳市民近年来的共同感受。2023年，深圳在广东省地市公共文化服务评价中得分连续四年位居全省第一。这座城市的公共文化服务正在完成从“有”到“优”的转变。
“这个系列的讲座我已经追了好几期了，解答了我对古代绘画的很多疑问，也进一步增进了对古代绘画的认识和了解，进一步增强了我对中华传统文化的热爱。”3月29日，在关山月美术馆举办的“美读之镜”讲座上，观众黄生告诉记者。
“艺术是形象的、直观的，艺术欣赏不仅仅需要兴趣的引导，还需要一定的知识积累和信息储备。”关山月美术馆相关负责人表示，我们悉心打造了“美读之镜”系列讲座，让艺术史与展览联动，为观众提供专业的鉴赏指导；“特藏赏阅”活动则开放馆藏珍稀画册，让小众学术资源惠及大众。
如今在深圳，更多优质文化资源直达基层，文化服务也更精细、深入、富有温度。

“白天要上班上学，晚上很多场馆不开放，怎么办？”针对上班族们的需求，深圳设立约50家24小时阅读空间，将市级场馆重点区域服务时间日均延长5小时；895家公共图书馆（图书室）、322台24小时自助图书馆组成“全城一座图书馆”，读者在家门口就能随借随还。
在福田区，“星罗棋布”计划创新性地将108个“嵌入式”文化空间植入社区，两年内举办近千场活动，服务超20万人次。这些“小而美”的空间通过主理人联盟、创意大赛等机制，实现文化服务的精准供给和可持续发展。
此外，深圳在完善公共文化空间的“硬件”上也下足了功夫。深圳湾畔，占地约5.1万平方米的深圳湾文化广场即将于今年秋天运营，并与法国装饰艺术博物馆、英国伦敦设计博物馆达成战略合作，走起“国际化”路线；香港中文大学（深圳）音乐学院、深圳歌剧院、深圳海洋博物馆等文化设施正加快建设，这些都将有利于进一步提升深圳的文化品位和国际影响力。
文化赋能治理：从“陌生人社会”到“温情关系网络”
从创建文明城市，到建设城市文明，在外来人口占比超60%的深圳，文化，正成为连接人与人之间情感的纽带。
华侨城创意文化园的周末市集总是异常热闹。手作艺人阿Ken的摊位前围满了人，他正在教小朋友将废弃材料重新编织成艺术品。“这里每月举办‘社区创意日’活动。”他说，“让设计师和居民面对面交流，既能激发创作灵感，也能改善人居环境。”
这个曾经的工业区如今80%的空间用于办公，但通过弱化物理边界，打造开放街区，已成为创意人群的聚集地。红砖广场上，市集、展览、分享会、户外瑜伽等活动轮番上演，让社区居民和上班族连接更加紧密。
“在这里，机构间是串门的，猫咪是大家的，好点子可能是在买早餐时聊出来的。”一位创意工作者这样描述华侨城创意文化园的氛围。“隔3岔5街区派对”等活动让居民可以在家门口逛集市、屋檐下吃便饭、绿荫下纳凉、阳台上听音乐会，构建起亲密的社区关系。
南山区则通过文化激活社区凝聚力。在有着534年历史的平山村，“古村里的传统市集”联动8个街道文明实践所，让剪纸、捏面人等传统手艺走进现代生活。南山麒麟舞等非遗表演，与爱心义卖、环保科普等活动结合，既传承了文化，又拉近了邻里距离。
“有一种情叫邻里情，它就像一股春风，吹进我们的街道，吹进我们的社区……”南山区粤海街道蔚蓝海岸社区的诗歌朗诵，蕴含着深圳社区治理的文化密码。南山区通过“1+4+N”邻里关爱系列活动400余场，探索出“四进四有”的邻里关系新模式，让来自五湖四海的新市民有更多归属感、获得感。
深圳的文化治理创新，还体现在品牌活动的打造上。连续举办24届的“深圳读书月”累计吸引1.5亿人次参与，成为全民阅读的“国家样板”；“创意十二月”孵化出大芬油画村、观澜版画基地等特色文化街区；莲花山草地音乐节、“吾城吾歌”城市民谣歌会“唱”出深圳的多元文化融合与精神内核。这些活动不仅丰富了市民生活，更塑造了“敢闯敢试、开放包容、务实尚法、追求卓越”的城市精神。
从数字技术加持文化基因，到文化服务浸润城市肌理，再到文化认同重构社区关系，深圳的文化发展路径展现出一个现代化国际大都市的文明追求。
如今的深圳，文化已经融入城市发展血脉，不仅是经济发展的新动能，更成为千万市民的情感纽带。

美國疾病預防控制中心顧問建議將注射 RSV 疫苗的年齡降至 50-59 歲,"美國疾病預防控制中心顧問建議將注射 RSV 疫苗的年齡降至 50-59 歲
- 14 票贊成新指南
- 之前的建議是 75 歲及以上的成年人和 60 至 74 歲的高危成年人
- 專家小組將於 6 月考慮為 50 歲以下的成年人接種 RSV 疫苗
- 專家小組還推薦使用 GSK 腦膜炎球菌疫苗
美國疾病控制和預防中心的外部專家小組周三建議，在年輕成年人中使用呼吸道合胞病毒疫苗，因為他們因病毒而患重病的風險較高。
這個由 15 名成員組成的專家小組以 14 票對 0 票建議 50 至 59 歲的高危成年人接種一劑 RSV 疫苗。小組的一名成員投了棄權票。
疾病預防控制中心目前建議 75 歲及以上的成年人和 60 至 74 歲的高危成年人接種該疫苗。
- ""小組投票成員之一簡-扎克（Jane Zucker）在投票前說：""讓我動搖的是，50 至 59 歲年齡組中顯然有一些人，例如肺移植患者
- 他們顯然會從接種這種疫苗中受益。
專家小組成員邁克爾-梅爾加（Michael Melgar）表示，如果該建議被美國疾病預防控制中心採納，將使該年齡組中約 30% 的美國成年人有資格接種 RSV 疫苗。
外部疫苗專家還要求提供更多數據，說明這種疫苗的益處的持久性以及再次接種的時機。
- ""無投票權的專家組成員杰森-戈德曼（Jason Goldman）說：""我非常支持降低接種年齡，並使接種盡可能簡單
- 而且他們還保持了盡可能廣泛的風險基礎。
RSV 通常會引起類似感冒的症狀，但也是導致幼兒和老年人肺炎的主要原因。據美國疾病預防控制中心估計，在美國，50 至 59 歲的成年人中每年約有 15,000 至 20,000 人因 RSV 而住院治療。
疾控中心主任通常會在小組建議實施前簽字，但該機構目前還沒有主任。美國總統特朗普（Donald Trump）對該職位的提名 (link)，即蘇珊-莫納雷斯（Susan Monarez） ，尚未得到美國參議院的確認。
美國食品和藥物管理局已經批準了三種RSV疫苗--葛蘭素史克公司 GSK的Arexvy、莫德納公司 MRNA的mRESVIA和輝瑞公司 PFE的Abrysvo。
Arexvy和Abrysvo分別被批準用於預防與RSV相關的下呼吸道疾病，適用於年齡在50至59歲和18至59歲的成人，這些人患病的風險較高。
莫德納 用於 18 至 59 歲高危成人的申請正在接受 FDA 審查。
該小組預計將在 6 月份的會議上審議 50 歲以下成人 RSV 疫苗的使用問題。
專家小組還投票推薦使用葛蘭素史克公司的五價腦膜炎球菌疫苗以及巴伐利亞北歐公司 BAVA和Valneva公司 VLA的單獨疫苗來預防蚊子傳播的基孔肯雅病毒。

美国债市：国债延续涨势 受鲍威尔讲话及国债标售提振_新浪财经_新浪网,"美国国债连续第三个交易日上涨，随着美联储主席鲍威尔发表讲话期间美股下跌，国债收益率触及盘中低点。鲍威尔表示美国的贸易政策可能会导致美联储在实现充分就业与维持价格稳定这两个目标之间出现冲突。他还认为，上周金融市场的动荡是面对高度不确定性的正常反应。在鲍威尔讲话前，20年期国债的标售获得强劲需求，支撑了此前的涨势。
纽约时间下午3点刚过不久，中期国债收益率下降多达8个基点，使5s30s曲线陡化5个基点，2s5s30s曲线收窄6个基点。
10年期美国国债收益率下跌约6个基点，接近4.27%左右的盘中低点，此前美国股市基准指数跌势加剧，导致标普500指数在尾盘下跌约3%，纳斯达克100指数跌幅超过4%。
在白宫对英伟达出口芯片施加新限制后，科技股跑输大盘。该股一度下跌10.5%。
130亿美元20年期国债标售获得良好需求，中标收益率4.810%，比预期低约0.4个基点。 一级交易商中标比例17%，高于先前一次；不过直接投标人中标比例降至12.3%，被间接投标人中标比例增加至70.7%所抵消。
与本周前半周的情况一样，期货成交量仍低于近期水平。截至下午3点，美国国债和SOFR期货成交量约为20日均值的60%。

Arsenal elimina e quebra 'pacto' do Real na Champions com VAR e cavada,"O Arsenal conseguiu o que muitos rivais não conseguiram nos últimos anos ao vencer com o Real Madrid por 2 a 1, no Santiago Bernabéu, e quebrar o ""pacto"" dos espanhóis para se garantir na semifinal da Champions.
O jogo teve o VAR protagonista . O árbitro de vídeo foi fundamental para ajudar na marcação de um pênalti para o Arsenal — perdido por Saka — e para anular uma penalidade a favor do Real Madrid.
Saka também foi personagem . O camisa 7 do Arsenal perdeu o pênalti ao tentar uma cavadinha, mas se redimiu e fez o primeiro gol dos ingleses da mesma maneira, desta vez com bola rolando. Martinelli fez o segundo dos Gunners, enquanto Vini Jr. descontou para o Real Madrid.
O Arsenal volta à semifinal da Champions após 16 anos . Os Gunners disputaram esta fase da competição pela última vez em 2009, quando foram eliminados pelo Manchester United .

2025 WNBA Draft sets record as 2nd-most viewed draft ever,"Even though fans criticized the WNBA for not promoting the 2025 Draft, the league managed to attract strong viewership.
The 2025 WNBA Draft brought in enough viewers to become the second-most-watched draft in league history, per ESPN. The draft averaged 1.25 million viewers and was the most viewed program across all television among the male 18-34 and 18-49 populations and the general 18-34 population.

[April 15, 2025]
The draft was defined by some notable highlights. The most obvious being the Dallas Wings selecting UConn's Paige Beuckers as the number one pick.
Other moments included the Seattle Storm drafting France's Dominique Malonga, known as the “female Wembanyama”. There was also TCU's Hailey Van Lith being selected by the Chicago Sky and reuniting with her former LSU teammate Angel Reese.
This years draft comes second in viewership behind the 2024 Draft that shattered records with 2.44 million viewers. A draft that was defined by the selections of Caitlin Clark, Angel Reese, and Cameron Brink.
All this comes at a time of tremendous interest in women's basketball. The WNBA is seeking to build off their rocket riding 2024 season that saw increased viewership and attendance.
However, the league should do more in terms of promoting the draft better.
The WNBA Draft could use more hype
The increased interest in the WNBA draft is a testament to the growth of the game. So the league should do more to hype up the draft.
The draft is an opportunity to tell the stories of the incoming class of players. A time to chronicle their journey to get to the stage and learn more about their hopes and dreams.
In addition to the storytelling, the WNBA should emphasize the impact of the draft just as the NBA and NFL does. They should dive more into why the selecting of a particular player will help the teams dynamics and thoroughly break down the strengths they bring and the weaknesses they can improve on.
There also needs to be more hype about the draft way in advance. Television commercials, social media posts, billboards, etc. are great avenues to generate interest, but it needs to come ahead of time.
The WNBA is in great position to continue its growth and interest in the draft is part of that growth.",2025-04-17T00:33:00.000+03:00,https://clutchpoints.com/wnba/wnba-news-2025-wnba-draft-record-viewed,Zachary Draves,positive
Suspect in Tabatha Tozzi murder arrested in Mexico after nearly two-year international manhunt,"By Alyssa Bethencourt
Click here for updates on this story
 LAS VEGAS, Nevada ( KTNV ) — After nearly two years of heartbreak and unanswered questions, the family of Tabatha Tozzi may finally see justice take a step forward.
Oswaldo Nathanahel Perez-Sanchez, the man accused of killing 26-year-old Tabatha Tozzi in Las Vegas in April 2023, was arrested Tuesday in Sonora, Mexico.
Mexican authorities confirmed in a Facebook post that the Unidad Especializada en Aprehensiones arrested Perez-Sanchez in Ciudad Obregón, acting on a warrant issued by the attorney general’s office in Sinaloa.
Perez-Sanchez is also being investigated in connection with the femicide and forced disappearance of another woman whose body was discovered on April 7, 2025, in Villa Fontana, Culiacán.
He had reportedly been living under the alias “Jorge N” while hiding in the region.
Authorities say he is now being transported to Culiacán, where he will be held at the Aguaruto Penitentiary and presented before the Court of Control and Criminal Prosecution. In a news release on Wednesday, the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department wrote that Perez-Sanchez’s extradition to the United States is pending.
Las Vegas police thanked multiple agencies for “their extensive follow-up and collaboration with Mexican authorities to locate Pereze-Sanchez,” including the U.S. Marshals Service Nevada Violent Offender Task Force, the U.S. Marshals Service – District of Arizona Tucson, the FBI, DEA Nogales Resident Office and the Customs and Border Protection Special Operations Group in San Diego.
“We have relentlessly pursued this fugitive, and the family can rest knowing that he is now in custody,” District of Nevada U.S. Marshal Gary Schofield stated.
“The collaboration required to apprehend this fugitive exemplifies the importance of teamwork,” added FBI Las Vegas Special Agent in Charge Spencer Evans. “We hope this outcome provides a measure of peace to the family, knowing that he is now in custody.”
A mother’s unimaginable loss
The arrest marks a major development in a case that has gripped the Las Vegas community for nearly two years. Tabatha Tozzi, a young woman described by friends and family as bright, loving, and full of potential, was killed in April of 2023. Metro police say she was shot outside of a northwest Las Vegas home, allegedly by her boyfriend, Perez-Sanchez, before he fled the country.
Her mother, Regina Lacerda, has been a tireless advocate for justice ever since. In multiple emotional interviews, she spoke candidly about the pain of losing her daughter and the torment of knowing the suspect remained at large.
“The day before this happened, she even told me, ‘Mom, I’m not happy. I’m trying to break up with him, but I’m afraid,’” Lacerda previously told Channel 13. “She said she was afraid he’d do something to himself. And I said, ‘To himself or to you?’”
On the morning of the shooting, Lacerda received a frantic call from her daughter asking to be picked up. “I couldn’t make it there on time to save my daughter,” she recalled, through tears.
The search for justice
For months, the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department and the FBI worked to locate Perez-Sanchez. Ten days after the shooting, Metro Police released his photo to the public. Some, including Lacerda, questioned whether releasing it earlier might have made a difference.
In 2023, on what would have been Tabatha’s 27th birthday, the FBI announced they had officially joined the case, intensifying the international search and raising the reward for information to $30,000.
Retired LVMPD Lieutenant Randy Sutton had said at the time, “You can run for a while, but they are on the scent, and once they’re on the scent, they’re not getting off it.”
A community united: “The Tabby Tribe”
Throughout the investigation, friends and supporters formed what became known as the “Tabby Tribe”—a passionate group determined to keep Tabatha’s memory alive and demand accountability. Vigils, rallies, and memorials were held across the Las Vegas valley.
“My daughter will never be a cold case,” Lacerda told the crowd during a memorial event at the Metro Police Headquarters. “We will always fight for her.”

Japan court orders gov't to pay damages over treatment of detainee - The Mainichi,"Japan court orders gov't to pay damages over treatment of detainee
(Mainichi Japan)
OSAKA (Kyodo) -- A Japanese court on Wednesday ordered the state to pay 110,000 yen ($770) in damages for the illegal restraint of a Peruvian man of Japanese descent while he was detained at an immigration facility in Osaka in 2017.
In the lawsuit seeking about 2 million yen in compensation, the Osaka District Court acknowledged that the decision to use handcuffs was reasonable but ruled that immigration officers acted without meeting the necessary requirements.
According to the ruling and other sources, the man was placed in a solitary cell at the Osaka Regional Immigration Services Bureau on Dec. 20, 2017, after he became violent following complaints about his lunch.
As he attempted to lunge at an officer, he was restrained face down and handcuffed with his arms behind his back for about 90 minutes. Although the handcuffs were removed, he was again restrained in the same manner for more than 14 hours from around 9:10 p.m. after he began banging on the wall and door.
In delivering the ruling, Presiding Judge Ryoichi Horibe said it was reasonable to conclude that the man could not be adequately restrained without using handcuffs behind his back, given his level of agitation.
But the judge noted that the man became quiet and fell asleep after 1 a.m. on Dec. 21. He also criticized the immigration officers for lacking careful judgment in continuing to use handcuffs for more than eight consecutive hours, which required a superior's approval.
The man filed the lawsuit in 2020 and was later provisionally released, but died in 2023. His common-law wife subsequently took over the case.
The defendant's lawyers welcomed the court's support for some of their arguments but expressed disappointment that the ruling was based on the assumption that handcuffing behind the back, which they described as ""a human rights violation,"" is permissible.
They indicated that they will appeal the ruling.
The immigration bureau, meanwhile, said it ""will examine the ruling and discuss how to respond.""
The treatment of foreign nationals detained at Japanese immigration facilities has faced growing scrutiny in recent years, particularly after Ratnayake Liyanage Wishma Sandamali, a 33-year-old Sri Lankan woman, died in March 2021 at a Nagoya detention center following about a month of complaints about ill health.",2025-04-17T00:50:11.892+03:00,https://mainichi.jp/english/articles/20250417/p2g/00m/0na/004000c,,positive

Just now Health News Globalist World Health Org Ratifies Legally Binding Global Pandemic Treaty. PULSE POINTS: ❓ What Happened: Members of the World Health Organization (WHO) have agreed on the text of a legally binding treaty focused on improving responses to future pandemics.
👥 Who’s Involved: The World Health Organization, WHO member states, pharmaceutical companies, and manufacturers. U.S. negotiators abstained from the final talks.
Newsletter Need to Know. Your free, daily feed from The National Pulse.
Thank You! You are now subscribed to our newsletter.
📍 Where & When: The agreement was reached on Wednesday, following three years of discussions among member states. Formal adoption is expected at the World Health Assembly next month.
💬 Key Quote: “A significant milestone in our shared journey towards a safer world,” according to WHO director-general Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.
⚠️ Impact: The treaty mandates that countries ensure global access to pandemic-related drugs in future outbreaks. Manufacturers must allocate 20 percent of their production to the WHO, and at least 10 percent must be donations. It also includes a proposal for a Pathogen Access and Benefit-Sharing System for faster data exchange.
IN FULL: The World Health Organization ( WHO ) has settled on the text for a legally binding treaty supposedly aimed at enhancing global preparedness for future pandemics . This decision seeks to avoid the chaos and competition over resources that were prevalent during the COVID-19 pandemic.
This newly crafted pact emphasizes rapid data sharing on emerging diseases, enabling scientists and pharmaceutical firms to speed up the development of vaccines and treatments. For the first time, the WHO will have a comprehensive view of global supply chains related to personal protective equipment such as masks and medical gowns.
Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO’s director general, described the agreement as “a significant milestone in our shared journey towards a safer world.” He further noted that despite global divisions, this demonstrates nations’ ability to collaborate on common challenges.
The treaty, culminating after three years of discussion among member states, is only the second in the WHO’s history—the first being the 2003 tobacco control agreement. It awaits formal approval at the upcoming World Health Assembly.
Under the treaty, countries must ensure the global availability of pandemic-related medications in future outbreaks. The terms require manufacturers to allocate 20 percent of vaccine, therapeutic, and diagnostic production to the WHO, distribute 10 percent as donations, and offer the rest at accessible prices.
The U.S. was absent from the closing negotiations following President Donald J. Trump’s withdrawal decision, meaning the country will not adhere to the agreement once it departs from the organization in 2026.
Some Members of Parliament (MPs) in Britain expressed skepticism about a pandemic treaty in 2023, arguing it could allow the globalist WHO to have power over lockdowns , quarantine, and vaccines.

“这样的贸易，开启繁荣之门”“畅想消费新未来”……进入海南国际会展中心，一条条展馆标语映入记者眼帘。盛况空前的消博会，也在向世界宣示：中国开放的大门越开越大，这是中国与世界共同发展的坚定承诺。
“海南消博会和海南自贸港在促进全球贸易和展示中国经济开放方面具有重要意义。”在第五届中国国际消费品博览会上，爱尔兰驻华大使馆贸易参赞乔柯汀赞扬了海南自贸港的独特政策，称赞该模式是“中国开放的良好范例”。他说，企业可以享受免税准入，这为国际商务创造了新机遇。
“我们参加消博会就表明了我们对中国市场的强大信心，也让我们有机会向潜在合作伙伴展示产品。”英国化妆品品牌YASO的联合创始人亚当·奈特表示。谈到当前美国的国际贸易政策带来的影响时，奈特认为，消博会的举办正当其时，“YASO作为欧洲品牌，希望中国与英国、与欧洲之间有更紧密的商业联系”。
“如果征收高额关税，消费者将承担更加昂贵的生活成本。”法国精品酒庄联盟CEO哈迈·弗朗索瓦受访时说，世界各国都有不同的环境和文化，商品也各有特色，正是因为自由贸易，各国才能以较低的成本互通有无。哈迈·弗朗索瓦以在消博会上首发的5款新品为例介绍，它们出口到中国仅支付10%的关税。“相对而言这是比较低的税率，有利于商品进入中国市场销售”。
“对于我们这种中小企业来说，肯定不希望提高关税，因为这意味着老百姓生活成本的上升，而诸如燕窝这种高消费食品的生意就更难做了。”马来西亚蓝天燕窝有限公司负责人雪莉说。
在美国滥施所谓“对等关税”、严重冲击国际经贸格局的背景下，中国市场的坚定开放意味着给全球市场带来重要的确定性。“海南自贸港的政策优势与国际合作开放度，将助力我们实现本土化运营，未来不仅服务中国，还可辐射亚洲市场。”英国生物科技企业BHM携多项无药预防性健康技术首次亮相英国国家馆，标志着该企业正式进军中国市场，创始人兼首席执行官迈克尔表示，当下中国消费者对无药物、科学验证的健康解决方案有强烈的需求，这也与该企业的产品创新理念高度契合。展会期间，BHM计划与本土合作伙伴及消费者直接对接。
斯洛伐克、新加坡、巴西等多个国家首次组团参展，近百件新品首发、各类促进中外行业融合对接的论坛活动成功举行……本届消博会生动体现了各方加强经贸合作，抵御单边主义、保护主义的决心和信心。
“我们计划全面进入中国市场。”今年，斯洛伐克首次以国家馆形式参加消博会。斯洛伐克副总理丹尼萨·萨科娃表示，中国市场潜力无限，给众多欧洲企业提供了发展机遇。
中国是世界的市场、各国的机遇。外交部发言人林剑在例行记者会上评论近日开幕的消博会、广交会时表示，面对外部不确定性，中国将坚持“握手”而非“挥拳”、“拆墙”而非“筑垒”、“联通”而非“脱钩”，将继续不断做大贸易“朋友圈”，做强投资“引力场”，以高质量发展和高水平对外开放为世界经济注入稳定性和正能量。
“我们相信自由贸易，相信多边主义，我们认为关税战没有任何好处。”乔柯汀向记者重申了爱尔兰的贸易立场，也表达了对中国进一步扩大开放、与世界共享经济机遇的期待。

Donald Trump officials pinpoint moment Britons can expect US trade deal in boost for Brexit Britain,"GB News
A White House official said an agreement was expected in 'two weeks or maybe three'
Trending on GB News
White House officials believe a trade deal with Britain can be finalised within three weeks, sources have claimed.
An insider familiar with the strategy told The Telegraph that London was in a good position for a rapid deal.
However, the UK will likely be in a second wave of announcements, following Japan, India, and South Korea.
Donald Trump wants to reach agreements with these countries first in order to isolate China.
Britain was slapped with a blanket 10 per cent tariff on nearly all goods imported into the US after Trump's ""liberation day"" move to reset global trade
REUTERS
A White House official told The Telegraph that an agreement was expected ""soon"", saying: ""Two weeks or maybe three.""
It comes a day after JD Vance, the US Vice-President, sent the Ftse 100 surging by predicting that Trump would agree a ""great"" trade deal with London.
Vance cited Trump's ""cultural affinity"" with Britain as a key factor, telling Unherd: ""There's a real cultural affinity.""
""And of course, fundamentally America is an Anglo country... I think there's a good chance that, yes, we'll come to a great agreement that's in the best interest of both countries.""
MORE LIKE THIS:
Vance added that they were ""working very hard with Keir Starmer's Government"".
Britain was slapped with a blanket 10 per cent tariff on nearly all goods imported into the US after Trump's ""liberation day"" move to reset global trade.
White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said there were already 15 trade deals on the table.
More than 75 countries have reached out to strike agreements before the end of a 90-day pause on more aggressive tariffs.
Trump officials have said Britain was in a good position for a fast deal because it imports more goods from the US than it exports.
However, they also caution that nothing can be taken for granted with Trump's unpredictable style.
Steve Bannon, Trump's former strategist, said a deal with the UK would be among the simplest and fastest to negotiate.
""You (Britain) don't make anything anymore,"" he said. ""You don't make anything we're trying to bring back. That's why Japan and Korea will be tough.""

Trump met Japanese officials on Wednesday morning.
Chancellor Rachel Reeves is expected in Washington next week for the IMF's spring meetings.
Britain may have to wait for other deals to be finalised as the Trump administration tries to build a trade bloc against China's manufacturing might.
South Korea's finance minister is due to meet Trump's treasury secretary next week.
However, Britain comes with advantages that other nations cannot match, according to Vance, who noted that Britain and the US already enjoy a ""reciprocal relationship"".

Bay of Quinte federal candidates debate for energetic audience,"Fittingly, the Empire Theatre—a venue known for entertainment—lived up to its name, as both the federal candidates and an engaged audience brought energy and unexpected moments to the local stage turned political stage.
The Belleville Chamber of Commerce, in partnership with the Central Lakes Association of Realtors, hosted a federal candidates’ debate for the Bay of Quinte riding at the downtown Belleville theatre on April 15. Candidates included Conservative incumbent Ryan Williams, Liberal Chris Malette, the Green Party’s Erica Charlton, and the NDP’s Kate Crothers. Chris Auger, president of the Belleville Chamber of Commerce, moderated the event.
Before the debate began, all questions were submitted online or to the Dropbox at the theatre. No questions were taken from the floor.
The audience was polite and celebratory when each candidate was introduced, except for one small group that stood and booed the Liberal candidate; they were quickly shushed by those around them. Auger warned that disruptive audience members could face expulsion.
After the introductory statements, the debate began. Each candidate had a chance to be the first to answer a question. That candidate got two minutes to discuss the answer, followed by one-minute responses from the other candidates and a one-minute rebuttal from the initial responder. The questions were randomly drawn.
Ryan Williams was asked the first question about what a Conservative government would do to fix the housing crisis. He started by saying this issue is the biggest one faced by the Quinte region and Canada. “The biggest threat to home building is the people. We get in the way of housing construction and new starts.” He said the average housing construction project in Canada takes seven years. “Government, regulations and planning get in the way.
“We’re going to make sure that we work with the provinces to eliminate a lot of the red tape that’s in the way, …But the bigger part is we’re going to cut tax on new home construction. We’re going to cut all the GST, which will save $64,000 for a new home, up to $1.3 million. That’s not just for first-time home buyers. That’s for any buyer. And what that does is it moves people, maybe out of their existing house, and more importantly, it frees up inventory.
“But more importantly, we’re working on affordable market rent and making more transitional housing,” he said, citing examples like Shiloh House and All-together Housing.
Chris Malette agreed with Williams that these local transitional housing models were spot on and pointed out that he had already discussed with All-Together, how their projects would perfectly dovetail with the Liberal government’s “Build Canada Homes” (BCH) program, billed as “Canada’s most ambitious housing plan since the Second World War.”
The Green Party will work effectively with all levels of government, said Charlton. “We need federal funding to make affordable housing, and when we say it’s affordable, we need to guarantee it stays affordable. Housing should not be more than 30 per cent of your income.” She said there should be a “covenant” to ensure the housing stays affordable, “to close loopholes and eliminate tax advantages for corporations, and we need to stop corporations from buying houses in our market.”
Crothers criticized big developers, who, she said, don’t build affordable housing because it isn’t profitable. “Rent control isn’t offered because billionaires want to stay rich.” She reminded the crowd that the Ford government in Ontario took away rent control, and now “people are struggling” to pay their bills. An NDP government would advocate for nationwide rent control and community housing, “for people like us who can’t afford a McMansion.”
The moderator next began with Mallette: “How will your party ensure that federal transfer payments to provinces result in equitable funding for rural communities like the Bay of Quinte, where the cost of delivering services often exceeds per capita models based on urban benchmarks?”
Mallette stressed the need for more assertive federal involvement in ensuring equitable funding for rural communities. “For instance, in healthcare spending, we send healthcare transfers to the province of Ontario. We know there was a $3 billion surplus, but they can’t explain where federal funding went that was earmarked for our hospitals and our waiting lists.” We need to have more. We need to have more, stronger, more enforced strings attached to those funding allowances.”
“A Carney government,” he said, would be “more assertive with those provincial partners in making sure that the money we send from Ottawa gets purpose-built for infrastructure, especially… on things like what we greatly need in Belleville, sewage pumping stations. We have a $100 million refit of the wastewater treatment facility. It’s going to require huge dollars. We must see that those federal dollars are adequately supplied and properly applied.”
The Green candidate took an opportunity to silence the same small group of people who had booed and talked among themselves throughout her and other candidates’ speaking time: “Maybe I need to speak a little bit louder so you listen to me more. Is that what it is? ”
To cheers from the larger audience, she said, “We need accountability in our government,” then turned directly to Williams, “You just said that we have food insecurity. Why did you vote against a National School Food Program? You talk about crime rising. That’s the direct result of poverty. Then why are you voting against affordability acts that would actually work? Or a basic livable income so that we can survive this change in our dynamic [with the U.S.].” The room erupted in cheers.
Williams then took his turn to emphasize the need for accountability in government spending, arguing that taxpayers’ money had not been used wisely over the past decade. He highlighted issues such as increased government hiring (“140,000 extra employees”) while many struggled with food insecurity and affordability. “And the government’s solution, why we voted against it, it was for more bureaucracy, for more employees when we actually need more meal programs, for money to the programs that are already running here doing that job.”
He proposed a different approach: tying taxpayer dollars to tangible outcomes like building homes, adding hospital beds, and hiring doctors and nurses, rather than expanding the public service.
Crothers called for accountability in government spending, citing projects in the region that went unfunded by the federal government, such as the redevelopment of the former Queen Elizabeth School site in Picton and Highway 49, “one of the worst highways in Ontario, maybe Canada, and that responsibility has been downloaded onto the community. The federal funding has not come yet, so it would be up to us to enforce that, to work with the federal government and the provincial government and communities to make that happen.”
Given the opportunity to respond, Malette said, “Well, we’re hearing about a need for a different approach to government and relations with the provinces, all the way down to the municipalities. But the Carney government is talking about a bold new fiscal approach that doesn’t gut the social services millions of us depend on. Daycare? That’ll stay. Pharmacare? Secure. Dental care? Still here. No slashing and burning of what keeps us going, just smarter ways to fund it. We’re not talking about fixing up the old place by adding a few boards on the fence and slapping a fresh coat of paint on the doors. We’re building a new house with a smart, savvy, bold architect and builder, and we’re going to change things in Ottawa starting today.”
A perhaps unexpectedly passionate audience reaction moment came when candidates were asked how their government would improve media literacy, with the abundance of misinformation on social media, and what source they would recommend to ensure accurate, unbiased news. An audience member yelled, “CBC!”
“Thank you for the prompt,” laughed Malette, “I’m going to go right to it. Our Conservative friends would like nothing better than to skewer the CBC.” Many audience members booed. “They want to defund it, put it to the scrap heap. Somebody better tell Casey and Finnigan because that is not a good idea. A new Liberal plan to protect our Canadian identity will actually strengthen the CBC and Radio Canada.” Cheers again with one man loudly booing, “Protecting our identity is critical to keeping Canada strong… We’ll stand up to protect [the CBC].
“We’re going to develop a governance plan for CBC and Radio Canada to improve accountability, empower leadership, streamline processes, and tap into the institution’s innovative spirit. Don’t tell me that the CBC is a government puppet agency. Listen, I was in the business long enough; I know it’s not a valuable asset to our country,” the former journalist said as cheers erupted.
The Green candidate agreed and went further, saying the CBC is a vital unifier.
“Our varying regions make it hard for us to agree on many things, because our experience is a lot different from region to region. The CBC unites us. We all benefit from it. If you are going to defund CBC what other place will you get both official languages and eleven and indigenous languages? …. And if you’re going to take that away from us, you’re going to take away part of Canada’s heart, especially in the darkest of times with the crises right now.”
Williams said he would set the record straight, “No one’s getting rid of the CBC. We’re getting rid of the government bloat, which is the CBC.”
The audience jeered.
Williams said the CBC generates $681 million a year in revenue and subscriptions, and “on top of that it gets $1.2 billion of government spending at a time when we have people going hungry and people going homeless.” He claimed a Conservative government would not eliminate CBC but “ensure that CBC can operate efficiently and ensure that their $681 million can bring that back to a more efficient statement. We’re not getting rid of CBC Canada.”
“But the other thing we’re going to do is to ensure local [news outlets] can put their event on Facebook or Meta or on IG, they’re going to be able to get that back, because we’re going to reverse that.”
That sparked a mixed, loud outburst from the audience, and the moderator warned them to temper their reactions.

Texas bill increasing public school funding and teacher pay gets initial House approval,"Sign up for The Brief, The Texas Tribune’s daily newsletter that keeps readers up to speed on the most essential Texas news.
Recommended Videos
The Texas House on Wednesday gave initial approval to its priority school funding legislation. In a 144-4 vote, the lower chamber preliminary approved a bill that would increase school districts’ base money per student, raise teacher salaries and limit the use of educators without formal classroom training. House Bill 2 would also improve special education by allocating funding based on the individual needs of children with disabilities.
[Voucher vote updates: Watch the Texas House debate education savings accounts]
Republicans, during hours of debate, celebrated the bill as a worthwhile $8 billion investment in public education. Democrats also voiced support for the legislation but argued that it barely scratches the surface of what districts need. Many school districts are currently grappling with challenges ranging from budget deficits and teacher shortages to campus closures.
The bill would notably increase schools’ base funding by $395 — from $6,160 to $6,555. That amount, known as the basic allotment, would automatically go up every two years by tying it to property value growth. Forty-percent of the allotment would go to salaries for school staff. Higher salary increases would go to teachers with more than a decade of classroom experience.
Lawmakers sparred over other aspects of the legislation — from whether the Legislature should continue to invest heavily in compensatory education, which offers support to underserved students at risk of dropping out of school, to how the state should hold charter schools accountable for mismanagement.
Upon final passage, HB 2 will go to the Senate for further consideration. That chamber has already passed a number of similar school funding proposals — though top lawmakers there have expressed opposition to increasing schools' base funding this session.
The basic allotment offers districts flexibility to address the unique needs of their campuses, which includes staff salaries, utilities and maintenance. The Senate has instead advocated for more targeted funding in areas like teacher pay, school security and special education.
[Texas officials’ claim that school funding is at an all-time high ignores inflation and temporary federal money]
The House voted on the bill shortly before taking up legislation that would create school vouchers in Texas, a top priority for Gov. Greg Abbott. Two years ago, public schools missed out on nearly $8 billion, which Abbott held hostage when vouchers failed to gain the support needed to pass then.

Victoria Sámano,
mujer trans y directora de la organización Lleca, aseguró que pedirán a los funcionarios una vivienda digna, ya que los albergues que ofrece el Gobierno de la Ciudad de México ‘están en pésimas condiciones’.
‘En estos espacios muchas veces hay comida en mal estado; hay venta de consumo de drogas e incluso hay grupos del crimen organizado que están involucrados. Además de que no hay agua y las porciones de comida son insuficientes’, expuso.
Por ello, exigirán que el Gobierno capitalino les brinde un espacio más amplio para el refugio independiente Lleca, donde dan atención a personas trans en situación de calle, así como comida que ‘pagamos con nuestro trabajo’.
Esto debido a que se ha rebasado la demanda de este espacio independiente.

Charlotte leaders weigh $100M affordable housing bond projects | wcnc.com,"CHARLOTTE, N.C. — Charlotte city leaders are weighing a series of affordable housing projects that could bring hundreds of new units to the Queen City, funded by a $100 million housing bond approved by voters last November.
At a meeting Monday night, city staff recommended approval for 13 proposed projects across Charlotte aimed at addressing the city’s growing need for affordable housing.
“There’s a significant need, and it’s growing,” Kaedon Grinnell, chief program officer at Roof Above , said. “Good affordable housing creates spaces where folks are not experiencing financial burden but are also connected to social supports that allow them to thrive.”
Roof Above is a nonprofit working to combat homelessness in Charlotte.
One such project is Barton South, a 140-unit affordable housing development planned along the Blue Line Extension. Located just half a mile from two grocery stores, the site is designed to provide easy access to transportation and essential services.
However, not every proposal received a green light. City staff did not recommend moving forward at this time with the Brooklyn Village redevelopment, which included a $13.5 million request — the largest in the history of the Housing Trust Fund.
Staff recommended deferring that project while alternative funding structures are explored. The proposal is expected to return to the city council in June.
Mark Jerrell, chair of the Mecklenburg County Commission, expressed both support for the project and concern about potential delays.
“I think this is the way we should engage with folks that are asking for public dollars,” Jerrell said. “But we also know this is one of the biggest opportunities we have as it relates to affordable housing. So in those terms, we want to make sure we are producing the best deal for the community, and so I certainly respect moving in a cautious manner, we just don’t want to let the caution impede progress.”
City Council is expected to vote on the recommended projects on April 28.

BJP councillors get party's support in stand against Chandigarh administration - The Tribune,"BJP councillors get party’s support in stand against Chandigarh administration
Day after Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) councillors expressed their anger against the “undemocratic” attitude of the administration and threatened to hand over mass resignation, the party leaders cutting across ranks rallied behind them in their stand.
The meeting, held under the chairmanship of Jatinder Pal Malhotra, the party’s local unit president, was attended by most BJP councillors including Mayor Harpreet Kaur Babla, as well as organising secretary Manthri Srinivasulu.
The leaders were of the view that the situation has become serious due to the anti-public attitude of some of the officers who were “working against the people of the city”. They said their demand will be raised at the highest level to shift such officers from the administration.
The councillors had opened a front against the Chandigarh administration over the financial crunch of the Municipal Corporation and ignoring the public representatives in the decision making process.
Rajiv Sharma, chief spokesperson of Chandigarh Congress, however, dismissed the threat of resignation from the BJP councillors as an attempt to divert attention from the blatantly anti-Chandigarh approach of national leadership of the saffron party.
He said the Administration cannot work beyond the policies, directions and mandate of the Ministry of Home Affairs.
Saying that no purpose will be served if the BJP councillors resign from their MC posts, the Congress spokesperson called upon them to instead resign from the party to help the city.",2025-04-17T00:40:00.000+03:00,https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/bjp-councillors-get-partys-support-in-stand-against-chandigarh-administration,Tribune News Service,positive

Arsenal beat Real Madrid again to book Champions League semi-final spot in style,"Champions League: Real Madrid 1 (Vini 67) Arsenal 2 (Saka 65, Martinelli 90+3) (Arsenal win 5-1 on aggregate)
Arsenal secured their first Champions League semi-final in 16 years after a historic 2-1 win against Real Madrid in the Bernabeu.
Bukayo Saka, who missed a first-half penalty, fired Arsenal into a 4-0 aggregate lead after 64 minutes, only for the holders to respond immediately when Vinicius Junior nicked the ball off William Saliba before he fired home.
Vinicius’ goal provided Real Madrid with some hope, but Arsenal held on to their three-goal advantage – following Declan Rice’s superb set-piece double at the Emirates eight days ago – before Gabriel Martinelli scored in stoppage time to make it 5-1 on aggregate and complete a memorable night in Spain for Mikel Arteta’s side.
Arsenal, who became the first English team to win twice at the Bernabeu following their victory here 19 years ago, will play Paris St Germain for a place in the final as they bid to be crowned European champions for the first time.
The buzz word ahead of Wednesday’s second leg was remontada – Spanish for comeback – with Jude Bellingham insisting Real Madrid were confident they could overturn Arsenal’s 3-0 lead.
But the focus of an electric period was on two contentious penalties – one that was awarded to Arsenal, and the other which the hosts were denied.
Before the two flashpoints a clearly offside Kylian Mbappé had the ball in the Arsenal net within two minutes and the disallowed goal only encouraged the home fans.
Yet it was Arsenal who had the best opportunities to open the scoring and both chances fell to Saka. On eight minutes, the England winger left David Alba tumbling to the turf before he unleashed a wicked shot on Thibaut Courtois’ goal which required a diving save.
Arsenal were awarded a penalty four minutes later when Raul Asencio was adjudged to have fouled Mikel Merino from Rice’s corner.
Referee Francois Letexier had not reacted but after he was urged to visit his pitchside monitor, he pointed to the spot.
Captain Martin Odegaard took the ball before handing it to Saka. But Arsenal’s star man fluffed an attempted Panenka with Courtois palming the poor penalty away with his left arm.
And 10 minutes later, Real thought they had a penalty of their own.
Rice grappled with Mbappe in the box and the France forward dropped to the deck. Letexier immediately blew his whistle and the Bernabeu erupted.
But Rice protested his innocence and a lengthy VAR check followed. In all, four minutes had passed from the initial foul before Letexier was asked to review his on-field decision. Another minute went by as the French official weighed up whether to overrule his own decision. He did and Arsenal survived.
Arsenal were happy to slow the game down – goalkeeper David Raya was booked for timewasting after 36 minutes – and a frustrated Real failed to muster a single shot on goal in the first half. Indeed, it was Courtois who was called into action again at the other end as he denied Martinelli low to his left in stoppage time.
The Spanish giants had now failed to score in three-and-a-half matches against Arsenal across the last 19 years. They needed at least three in the following 45 minutes to force extra-time.
But it was Arsenal who drew first blood as Saka atoned for his earlier miss. Saka and Odegaard were both involved in a brilliant build-up before Merino played the killer pass and Saka delivered the killer chip. In contrast to his dink from the spot, this time it worked, and the onrushing Courtois could do nothing to prevent Saka’s sublime finish from dropping into the net.
Real now required four goals to salvage anything from the tie, and they pulled one back immediately when Saliba was caught napping and Vinicius robbed the defender to haul Real level on the night.
At that stage, there were still 23 minutes to play, but, in truth, the 15-time European Cup winners never looked like scoring again.
When Mbappé hobbled off with 14 minutes remaining, Arsenal were all but over the line and the crowning moment came in stoppage time when Martinelli sealed a famous win.
Inter Milan 2 (Martinez 58, Pavard 61) Bayern Munich 2 (Kane 52, Dier 76) (Inter win 4-3 on aggregate)
Inter Milan reached the Champions League semi-finals with a 4-3 aggregate win over Bayern Munich after an enthralling 2-2 draw in the second leg of their quarter-final tie at the San Siro on Wednesday.
The Italians will face Barcelona next, who they defeated at the semi-final stage in 2010 before going on to beat Bayern in the final to complete the treble, and Simone Inzaghi’s side are still on course to repeat that feat this season.
It was a far from comfortable evening for Inter, but they did just enough in a pulsating clash between the top teams from Serie A and the Bundesliga.
Bayern, who lost the first leg 2-1, were the more aggressive side from the off, with Yann Sommer saving a shot on the turn from Thomas Mueller early on.
A mistake by Nicolo Barella allowed Mueller to steal possession and play a pass into Michael Olise but Alessandro Bastoni nicked the ball off his toe before he could get a shot away.
Inter came close with a Hakan Calhanoglu curled shot from distance but then needed some desperate defending after Konrad Laimer’s pullback from the byline.
Matteo Darmian blocked down Mueller’s shot and Sommer saved Leroy Sane’s rebound effort, and the side’s went in goalless at the break.
Bayern’s first attack of the second half led to Harry Kane netting his 11th goal of this season’s competition.
Leon Goretzka played the ball into Kane who took his time before teeing up a shot from a wide angle which he sent through the legs of Dimarco and into the far corner.
Bayern’s joy lasted all of six minutes, as Lautaro Martinez scored from a corner kick. His first headed effort came back off Joshua Kimmich and the Inter striker made no mistake with his shot from the rebound.
Inter went in search of a goal to kill off Bayern and found it within three minutes. Darmian had a shot cleared off the line by Eric Dier and from the resulting corner Benjamin Pavard powered a header past Jonas Urbig.
Bayern, however, refused to give in, and after a short corner, Serge Gnabry floated a ball into the box and Dier’s attempt at a headed cross from the byline ended up finding the net.
With 14 minutes still remaining, a nervy ending was guaranteed. Sommer made a diving save from Mueller deep into added time and the hosts held on and for the first time the Germans failed to win away to Inter, and exited the competition.",2025-04-17T00:43:00.000+03:00,https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/soccer/2025/04/16/arsenal-beat-real-madrid-again-to-book-champions-league-semi-final-spot-in-style,Wed Apr,positive

MGP Ingredients Adds Star Power to Board-What This Means for Investors,"MGP Ingredients Adds Star Power to Board—What This Means for Investors
MGP Ingredients (NASDAQ: MGPI) has quietly bolstered its boardroom with two high-profile hires, signaling a strategic pivot to capitalize on growth opportunities in both distilled spirits and food ingredients. The addition of Gerardo “Gerry” Lopez and Martin Roper—executives with deep ties to consumer brands and premium beverage markets—could reshape investor perceptions of the company’s trajectory.
The New Directors: Experience Meets Expertise
Lopez, former CEO of AMC Entertainment and Starbucks’ global consumer products chief, brings a rare blend of retail, consumer goods, and operational expertise. His tenure at AMC and Starbucks, where he managed complex supply chains and global brands, positions him to guide MGP’s expanding spirits portfolio. Meanwhile, Roper, CEO of Vita Coco and a veteran of The Boston Beer Company (SAM), offers a sharp focus on premium beverage branding and distribution.
The pair’s backgrounds are no accident. MGP’s press release explicitly ties their hires to “strategic and operational excellence,” a nod to its dual focus:
1. Spirits Growth: MGP’s bourbons (Penelope, Rebel, Yellowstone) and tequila (El Mayor) are gaining traction in premium markets.
2. Food Ingredients: Its high-margin protein and starch products serve food manufacturers, a segment less cyclical than spirits.
Why Now? The Strategic Rationale
MGP’s move comes amid a robust spirits market. The U.S. distilled spirits category grew by 3.8% in 2023, outpacing beer and wine, driven by craft and premium brands. Meanwhile, MGP’s Ingredient Solutions segment—its food ingredients division—benefits from rising demand for clean-label products.
But MGP has lagged peers like Brown-Forman (BF.A) in brand-building. Its spirits are largely sold to third-party distillers, limiting direct-to-consumer profits. Lopez and Roper’s experience could accelerate vertical integration or licensing deals, similar to how Roper leveraged retail partnerships at Vita Coco.
Data Dive: Can the Stock Catch Up?
MGPI’s stock has underperformed since 2021, down ~20% compared to a 50% rise in the S&P 500. The question is whether the board shakeup can rekindle investor confidence.
The company’s financials hint at potential. While spirits sales grew 15% in 2023, margins remain constrained by corn prices. Roper’s experience with premium pricing could help offset this, particularly in tequila and craft bourbon, where margins are higher.
Risks and Opportunities
The hires aren’t without challenges. The spirits market is crowded, with giants like Diageo (DEO) and Bacardi expanding in premium categories. Meanwhile, MGP’s reliance on corn makes it vulnerable to commodity swings.
Yet, the board additions align with a clear path to growth:
- Strategic Acquisitions: Lopez’s M&A experience (e.g., AMC’s turnaround) could drive bolt-on deals in spirits distribution or branding.
- Global Expansion: Roper’s international experience at Vita Coco could boost MGP’s Mexico-based tequila joint venture.
Conclusion: A Strong Hand at the Helm?
MGP’s board overhaul isn’t just about optics. Lopez and Roper bring expertise tailored to MGP’s two core engines: premium spirits and food ingredients. With the global premium spirits market projected to hit $200 billion by 2030, their leadership could position MGP to capture share.
Investors should watch for:
- Margin Expansion: Can premium pricing offset commodity costs?
- Deals & Partnerships: Signs of licensing or acquisitions in spirits.
- Governance Clarity: Whether the board’s “strategic priorities” translate to quarterly results.
While MGPI’s stock has lagged, the board’s strategic hires suggest it’s no longer playing defense. For investors, this could mark a turning point—if the new directors can turn potential into profit.
In a sector where brands and operational efficiency rule, MGP now has a team with the résumés to compete. The question is whether execution keeps up with ambition.",2025-04-17T00:03:36.514+03:00,https://www.ainvest.com/news/mgp-ingredients-adds-star-power-board-means-investors-2504,Henry Rivers,positive
"Time is running out to get checks between $10,000 to $48,000 from $92 million settlement - and no proof is needed - NewsBreak","AMERICANS can score up to $48,000 from a massive $92.5 million lawsuit settlement. The compensation comes from New York City after claims that plaintiffs were held in custody longer than legally allowed. Anyone who was detained by the New York City Department of Correction past their scheduled release date may be able to cash in from the settlement. The lawsuit covers people held past their scheduled release between April 1, 1997, and December 21, 2012, solely due to ICE detainer requests. ICE - Immigration and Customs Enforcement - enforces immigration laws and handles the detention and removal of individuals in the US. If all other conditions for release were met - yet you were held solely due to an ICE detainer - you may be entitled to compensation. Several requirements must be fulfilled to be eligible to get a portion of the funds. The settlement identifies two main groups: the Statute of Limitations Group and the Recent Group. The Statute of Limitations Group includes those detained past release from April 1, 1997, to January 31, 2007. The Recent Group includes those detained past release between February 1, 2007, and December 21, 2012. According to the class action lawsuit, the Department of Correction allegedly detained individuals longer than legally allowed based solely on ICE detainer requests. The New York City Department of Correction oversees the city's prisons and rehabilitation programs. Plaintiffs say that, based on ICE’s own guidelines, the department only had the authority to hold someone for up to 48 hours due to an ICE detainer - but often exceeded that time limit. Although New York City denies any wrongdoing, it has agreed to the $92.5 million settlement to resolve the allegations. Exact payouts will vary depending on how many days a person was unlawfully held and how many people submit valid claims. According to the settlement website, Recent Group members may get between $20,000 and $48,000 on average. Statute of Limitations Group members are expected to get between $10,000 and $24,000 on average. The deadline to request exclusion from or object to the settlement is May 15, 2025. The final court hearing to approve the settlement is October 6, 2025. To receive compensation, you must submit a valid claim form by May 15, 2025.",2025-04-17T00:02:00.000+03:00,https://www.newsbreak.com/the-us-sun-513995/3965823098937-time-is-running-out-to-get-checks-between-10-000-to-48-000-from-92-million-settlement-and-no-proof-is-needed,Eliana Nunes,positive

Defienden tauromaquia y peleas de gallos como tradiciones de Aguascalientes,"Este 16 de abril se llevó a cabo la Marcha por la Libertad, en la que charros, galleros, cabalgantes, toreros, ganaderos, subalternos, artistas, empresarios, comerciantes, niñas, niños, taxistas y la sociedad civil sumaron esfuerzos en defensa de las tradiciones del estado de Aguascalientes.
En el trayecto por una de las principales avenidas del centro de la ciudad de Aguascalientes participaron miles personas con el objetivo de reiterar la importancia que representan la tauromaquia, la charrería y las peleas de gallos como parte fundamental de la Feria Nacional de San Marcos.
Durante la exposición de motivos en el Pleno del Congreso Local, diputados de las distintas bancadas políticas destacaron la importancia que tiene la Feria Nacional de San Marcos como motor de la economía y como parte esencial de las actividades artísticas y culturales que dan identidad a los aguascalentenses.
Se señaló que estas actividades representan una importante fuente de empleo y son parte fundamental de la verbena, generando solo durante la temporada de feria una derrama económica cercana a los 9 mil millones de pesos, la generación de 12 mil empleos, así como el arribo de 8 millones de visitantes cada año.
Al votar a favor de este dictamen, los Legisladores locales aseguran la preservación de la Feria Nacional de San Marcos y así como de las tradiciones que son parte de la historia local dejando en claro que “sin libertad no hay cultura y sin cultura no hay identidad”.
De esta manera, Aguascalientes se convierte en el único estado del país en donde la tauromaquia está blindada y la Feria Nacional de San Marcos es parte del patrimonio cultural que podremos heredar a las próximas generaciones.

Miami-Dade's first sheriff in 60 years reflects on first 100 days in office,"DORAL, Fla. – Miami-Dade Sheriff Rosie Cordero-Stutz on Wednesday marked her 100th day in office by outlining key accomplishments and laying out her vision for the future of the newly reestablished sheriff’s office.
Leer en español
Cordero-Stutz, the first elected sheriff in the county in more than six decades, took office in January after voters approved a constitutional amendment to restore the position.
During a news conference at the sheriff’s headquarters in Doral, she said her administration is focused on four key pillars: rooting out corruption, reducing crime, improving transparency and accountability and strengthening officer training.
“These first 100 days have been intense, yet rewarding,” Cordero-Stutz said.
She highlighted several accomplishments, including the arrest of multiple county employees accused of extortion schemes.
Cordero-Stutz credited those arrests to her office’s collaboration with the Miami-Dade State Attorney’s Office.
She also pointed to a drop in violent crime, reporting a 22% decrease in murders in unincorporated Miami-Dade compared to the same period in 2024.
“The homicide bureau has successfully closed 20 murders — 66% improvement over the same time the previous year,” she said.
Cordero-Stutz said training remains a cornerstone of her administration’s strategy.
“Training allows us to elevate our standards,” she said. “From new cadets entering the academy to ongoing training for deputies and our command staff.”
She also announced plans for future enforcement efforts, including a countywide crackdown on the illegal use of handicap placards.
Other upcoming initiatives include boosting the presence of deputies at houses of worship and combating cyber scams targeting Miami-Dade residents.

Biden at Harvard: Former president visits students,"Former president Joe Biden visited the Harvard Kennedy School on Wednesday to meet with students at the invitation of his longtime adviser, Mike Donilon, according to the school.
Biden met with students in a seminar course led by Donilon, who is a fellow at the Kennedy School’s Institute of Politics for the spring, according to a person familiar with the event. They said about 50 students attended the event and had an off-the-record Q&A style discussion with Biden.
In a statement, the Kennedy School said Biden joins a list of former presidents and presidential candidates from both major political parties who have visited the school, including presidents George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton, Bob Dole, Jeb Bush, John McCain, and Al Gore.
“As a school devoted to training the next generation of public leaders, we are proud to welcome senior policy makers and political figures representing a broad cross-section of views to engage with our students,” a Kennedy School spokesperson said in a statement.
Biden’s visit was first reported by the Harvard Crimson .

Sources familiar with the visit said Donilon invited Biden to speak with students several weeks ago. They said the former president’s visit to Cambridge on Wednesday was not related to the university’s ongoing dispute with the Trump administration, which has threatened the university’s tax-exempt status and froze $2 billion in federal funding over its handling of antisemitism on campus.
The Crimson reported that select students in the Kennedy School received invitations Tuesday to attend the visit but were not told who the guest would be.

Putin elogia Musk (di nuovo): ecco cosa li accomuna,"Negli ultimi anni, il presidente russo, Vladimir Putin, ha espresso in più occasioni il suo apprezzamento per il fondatore di SpaceX, non solo per le sue capacità imprenditoriali ma anche per la sua visione sul futuro. Le dichiarazioni di stima e perfino l’ipotesi di una collaborazione spaziale con Musk rivelano un interesse che va ben oltre la retorica diplomatica.
Il presidente russo, Vladimir Putin, ha elogiato Elon Musk durante un incontro con gli studenti. Putin ha paragonato l'amministratore delegato di SpaceX a Sergei Korolev, l'ingegnere capo e padre del programma spaziale dell’Unione Sovietica.
Fu Korolev a guidare le missioni che portarono al primo satellite, lo Sputnik, e al primo uomo nello spazio, Jurij Gagarin. Putin infatti ha lanciato un messaggio implicito di fiducia e ambizione. Con le sue parole ha affermato che le nuove idee di Musk oggi possono sembrare incredibili, forse addirittura utopiche. Ma lo stesso accadeva in passato, con i progetti di pionieri come Korolev, che sembravano irrealizzabili ma poi sono diventati realtà scrivendo la storia.
Parlando della politica spaziale, il leader russo avrebbe affermato:
L'agenzia russa Tass riferisce che, in occasione dell'incontro con gli studenti, Putin ha annunciato anche l'imminente approvazione di un nuovo progetto nazionale nel settore spaziale.
Sebbene ogni volta faccia notizia, non è la prima volta che Putin esprime il suo apprezzamento verso Musk. Il magnate delle Big Tech oggi, oltre a essere un imprenditore, è anche un consigliere del presidente americano, Donald Trump, e ha il compito di tagliare i costi del governo federale. Tuttavia, nel 2023, al Forum economico di Vladivostok, Putin lo definiva ""un uomo d'affari attivo e di talento."" A riportarlo era stato The Independent riferendo che Putin si era complimentato con il Ceo di Tesla dopo che aveva dichiarato di essersi rifiutato di consentire a Kiev di utilizzare la rete internet Starlink per lanciare un attacco a sorpresa contro le forze di Mosca in Crimea.
Nel febbraio 2024, Vladimir Putin, in un'intervista rilasciata al giornalista americano Tucker Carlson, affermava ""Musk non può essere fermato"". Il titolare del Cremlino aveva affermato che Musk è ""una persona intelligente"" e, parlando di Neuralink, aveva dichiarato:
La società è stata fondata da Musk nel 2016 e sviluppa chip che potrebbero in futuro essere impiantati nel cervello umano.
Il presidente russo e l’uomo più ricco del mondo condividono lo stesso interesse verso Marte. Sebbene si tratti di un compito ambizioso per i voli su Marte, la Russia ha in programma di esplorare lo spazio profondo.
Secondo quanto riportano i media russi, il capo del Fondo russo per gli investimenti diretti, Kirill Dmitriev, avrebbe avanzato a Elon Musk la proposta di una missione congiunta tra Russia e Stati Uniti su Marte, con partenza prevista nel 2029:
Due mesi fa, invece, il presidente russo ha affermato che le aziende russe potrebbero avviare una collaborazione con Musk dopo che avrà completato il suo compito nell’amministrazione statunitense:",2025-04-17T00:31:00.000+03:00,https://www.tag24.it/1316563-putin-elogia-musk,Nazlican Cebeci,positive

Negociação encerra greve dos rodoviários em Manaus após dois dias de paralisação | Amazonas | G1,"1 de 1 Reunião define fim da greve dos rodoviários em Manaus. — Foto: Divulgação/Semcom Reunião define fim da greve dos rodoviários em Manaus. — Foto: Divulgação/Semcom
A paralisação dos rodoviários em Manaus chegou ao fim na tarde desta quarta-feira (16), após um acordo firmado entre o Sindicato dos Trabalhadores em Transportes Rodoviários e o Sindicato das Empresas de Transporte de Passageiros do Estado do Amazonas (Sinetram), com mediação da Prefeitura de Manaus.
A greve, que afetou cerca de 30% da frota e impactou mais de 300 mil usuários do transporte coletivo, foi encerrada após uma rodada final de negociações conduzida pelo Instituto Municipal de Mobilidade Urbana (IMMU).
A proposta construída assegura um reajuste salarial próximo ao percentual solicitado pela categoria e prevê avanços na discussão sobre motoristas que também atuam como cobradores, além de um plano para retirada gradual da função de cobrador em algumas linhas.
“Por orientação do prefeito David Almeida, conduzimos a negociação com firmeza e responsabilidade. O acordo contempla pontos importantes das reivindicações e garante o restabelecimento do serviço à população”, destacou Arnaldo Flores, diretor-presidente do IMMU.
O presidente do Sindicato dos Rodoviários, Givancir Oliveira, afirmou que a proposta foi aceita por ser razoável diante do atual cenário do sistema. “Não contempla tudo o que pedíamos, mas com certeza a greve acaba. Vamos formalizar com a diretoria”, disse.
O advogado do Sinetram, Fernando Moraes, também elogiou a atuação da prefeitura. “A proposta tem viabilidade econômica e só foi possível graças à intermediação do IMMU e ao apoio direto do prefeito”, declarou.
A greve havia começado na madrugada de terça-feira (15), após autorização judicial. Segundo o TRT da 11ª Região, a categoria era obrigada a manter pelo menos 70% da frota nos horários de pico e 50% nos demais períodos, sob pena de multa de R$ 60 mil por hora de descumprimento.
Durante os dois dias de paralisação, usuários relataram atrasos e tumulto nos terminais. No Terminal 3, Zona Norte de Manaus, o autônomo Francisco Silva reclamou da demora: “Ontem foi difícil e hoje está sendo pior. Tá demorando mais ainda”.
Com o fim da greve, a expectativa é que o serviço de transporte coletivo seja normalizado nas próximas horas em toda a capital.

Paralisação
A iniciativa foi do Sindicato dos Trabalhadores em Transportes Rodoviários de Manaus, após uma decisão judicial autorizar a greve dos trabalhadores do transporte público.
Segundo o Sindicato das Empresas de Transporte de Passageiros do Estado do Amazonas (Sinetram), nesta quarta-feira, 397 veículos de sete empresas pararam desde às 4h.
Segundo a decisão do Tribunal Regional do Trabalho da 11ª Região (TRT 11), 70% da frota tem que circular nos horários de pico das 6h às 9h e das 17h às 20h.
Já para os demais horários a circulação tem que ser no mínimo de 50% dos ônibus, sob pena de multa de R$ 60 mil por hora de descumprimento.
Ao g1, usuários que estavam no Terminal 3, localizado na Zona Norte de Manaus, reclamaram que neste segundo dia de greve os ônibus demoraram mais tempo para chegar do que no primeiro dia, e que também houve tumulto para entrar nos coletivos.
""Ontem foi difícil e hoje está sendo pior, tá demorando mais ainda. Se a gente for esperar por esses homens, tá difícil"", disse o autônomo Francisco Silva enquanto aguardava o transporte.
Aumento na passagem
Em entrevista coletiva no fim da manhã desta quarta-feira, durante o cumprimento de agenda em uma escola na Zona Norte de Manaus, Almeida afirmou para jornalistas que o reajuste salarial pedido pela classe depende do reajuste da tarifa do ônibus , que hoje custa R$ 4,50.
""Esse é um dos itens que está ocasionando a greve, porque só pode dar o aumento para os rodoviários se tiver o aumento da passagem. Todas as capitais aumentaram"".
Em fevereiro deste ano, o prefeito anunciou o aumento do valor da passagem para R$ 5 . A medida, no entanto, foi barrada pela Justiça do Amazonas sob a alegação de que faltaram transparência e estudos técnicos que justifiquem o aumento.
Entre março e abril deste ano, a prefeitura e o Ministério Público se reuniram duas vezes para negociar o aumento . No último dia 10, o STJ suspendeu a liminar que impedia reajuste da tarifa e uma nova reunião deve ocorrer nos próximos dias.
""O Ministério Público hoje não está questionando o aumento da passagem. Na petição, eles estão questionando a metodologia do subsídio, então essa metodologia precisa ser discutida em outro momento"", afirmou David Almeida.
""Eu acredito que nos próximos dias a gente vá chegar em um entendimento para fazer o aumento da passagem, dar o aumento para os rodoviários e ter de volta a normalidade do transporte coletivo"", concluiu o prefeito.

UVM Board and Staff Union ratify three-year contract,"The Waterman Building on the University of Vermont campus in Burlington on Sept. 20, 2023. File photo by Glenn Russell/VTDigger The University of Vermont’s Board of Trustees approved the collective bargaining agreement between the university and UVM Staff United, the non-faculty union, on Tuesday after more than a year of negotiations, ushering in a new three-year contract for the union.
The contract includes wage increases, small annual bonuses and other benefits — like a raise in the cap on the number of hours an employee can draw from a collectively held bank of sick days and an end to a six-month waiting period for new employees to enroll in dental insurance. It also sets a higher minimum wage for hourly workers, to $20.80 starting in the first pay period after ratification.
“We are relieved that this long struggle has concluded, and we will finally have the money we have earned in our pockets,” union co-president Ellen Kaye said in an interview.
The university and Staff United have been negotiating a new contract since February 2024, and the previous contract expired in July 2024. The new contract includes a provision for a 4% base salary increase that retroactively covers the period since that last contract expired. Base salaries will increase 3.75% starting July 2025, and 3.5% in July 2026.
“This new contract demonstrates a sincere, mutual commitment to this important relationship and sets the stage for more shared success over the next three years of working together,” UVM Chief Human Resources Officer Chris Lehman wrote in a press release.
Kaye said that over the span of negotiations the union members — all of whom hold non-faculty and non-custodial jobs at the university, such as librarians, research assistants, administrative assistants — have used “every tool at our disposal” to achieve these gains.
The new contract opens up a pathway for the university to implement a career path structure that should make it easier for employees to move up, Lehman said in an interview. He said he sees the ability to implement the program as one of the biggest gains in the new contract.
Essentially, Kaye added, it gives union employees the right to bargain about why workers are placed in a certain job category, while preserving the right to negotiate.
Kaye said that wages have been the biggest sticking point for the union, given that about 70% of the union members still do not make a liveable wage in line with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s determination for the Burlington area — a household of one person would qualify as low income in 2024 if the annual income was less than $66,600.The median income among members before this raise was $55,000 annually, Kaye said.
To close the negotiations, the union had to make concessions on base salary — “I will say we came closer to (the university’s number) than they came to us on wages,” Kaye said — but the contract maintained all of the workers’ other demands.
Lehman said university leaders made the salary decisions in accordance with the current job market, consulting against a range of industry platforms to understand what is appropriate.
The ultimate agreed-upon salary increases are still not up to a livable wage for the Burlington area, Kaye said, but they’re a start.
“Now our focus is on the fact that we have a bigger fight on our hands, with the (federal government’s) attack on higher education. We are looking forward to working in concert with the university against the challenges to higher education,” Kaye said.",2025-04-17T00:47:00.000+03:00,https://vtdigger.org/2025/04/16/uvm-board-and-staff-union-ratify-three-year-contract,Olivia Gieger,positive

Cuenta además con espacios comunes como comedor, cocina, sala de televisión y aseos, y está ubicada en una parcela de 656 metros cuadrados, con una superficie construida de 265 metros cuadrados.
Forma parte de un complejo que incluye un gimnasio anexo, destinado tanto a personas mayores como al conjunto de la población.
Modelo de atención local, con perspectiva de integración en la red regional
Durante su intervención, la consejera de Bienestar Social ha señalado que esta vivienda “responde plenamente al modelo que defendemos: cercanía, accesibilidad y convivencia”, y ha apuntado que “este proyecto, además, se podrá venir a sumar a la amplia red de viviendas de mayores que tenemos en nuestra región, porque podemos decir, y lo podemos decir con orgullo, que somos la comunidad autónoma en España que mayor red de viviendas de mayores tenemos”.
García Torijano ha recordado que “tenemos una red de 174 viviendas en Castilla-La Mancha, de las cuales dentro de la red pública son 157 viviendas, con más de 1.500 plazas públicas, las que están en los pueblos de nuestra región, especialmente en los entornos más rurales, que es donde, además, especialmente potenciamos y reforzamos esas políticas sociales para la gente mayor. Es un modelo de éxito que refleja nuestra apuesta por los cuidados en el entorno rural y que seguimos reforzando con medidas como la extensión del servicio nocturno o la mejora del acompañamiento profesional”.
La consejera, además, ha puesto en valor la implicación municipal: “El Ayuntamiento de Montesclaros ha hecho posible un recurso que aporta calidad de vida, autonomía y tranquilidad a las personas mayores y a sus familias”, y ha añadido que “este proyecto se ha levantado con inversión pública, colaboración ciudadana y visión social”.
Atención centrada en la persona y compromiso con el medio rural
La nueva vivienda se convierte en el primer recurso de servicios sociales en Montesclaros, en una zona donde no existía hasta ahora ningún equipamiento residencial público o concertado. La titular de Bienestar Social ha insistido en que “hoy damos un paso más en la construcción de un sistema de atención que escucha, respeta y acompaña, en el que nadie queda atrás por vivir en un pequeño municipio”.
Desde el Gobierno regional se continúa trabajando para garantizar una atención integral a las personas mayores, basada en la permanencia en el entorno, la cercanía de los recursos y el fortalecimiento de la red de servicios sociales, especialmente en zonas afectadas por la despoblación.",2025-04-17T00:55:56.850+03:00,https://eldiadigital.es/art/491225/page-inaugura-en-montesclaros-una-nueva-vivienda-para-mayores,ELDIAdigital.es,positive

GOLDEN CROSS COMPLETES ACQUISITION OF AUSTRALIAN REEDY CREEK AND PROVIDENCE PROJECTS
Golden Cross Resources Inc. has completed its acquisition of the Reedy Creek and Providence gold projects in Victoria, Australia, from Great Pacific Gold Corp., as previously disclosed in the company's news releases dated Dec. 3, 2024, Feb. 13, 2025, March 12, 2025, and April 11, 2025.
In connection with the completion of the transaction (as defined herein), the company has applied to the TSX Venture Exchange to graduate from the NEX board of the exchange to become a Tier 2 mining issuer on the exchange. The common shares of the company are expected to commence trading on the exchange on April 21, 2025, under the ticker symbol AUX.
The company entered into a share purchase agreement dated effective Dec. 3, 2024, as amended on April 10, 2025, among the company, the vendor and 1513609 B.C. Ltd. (BC Subco), pursuant to which the company acquired 100 per cent of the issued and outstanding shares of BC Subco, which holds, through its Australian subsidiary, Providence Gold, a 100-per-cent beneficial interest in and to the project.
Pursuant to the terms of the definitive agreement, the company completed the transaction in consideration for:
a non-refundable cash deposit of $500,000 paid to the vendor upon the execution of the definitive agreement (which was paid by 1512736 B.C. Ltd. (Fundco), as described below);
a cash payment of $500,000 paid to the vendor on the closing date of the transaction;
six million common shares issued to the vendor on the closing date.
In addition to the payments described above, the company will pay to the vendor the follow postclosing payments:
In the event that the company publishes a technical report which establishes on the project a mineral resource in any combination of a measured, indicated, inferred resource, of at least one million ounces of gold and/or gold equivalent, the company will make a cash payment of $1-million to the vendor.
In the event that the company enters into commercial production of gold ore or concentrate on the project, then the company will make a cash payment of $2-million to the vendor.
Prior to completion of the transaction, the company changed its name from Zincore Metals Inc. to Golden Cross Resources Inc. and consolidated its share capital on the basis of one postconsolidation common share in the capital of the company for every 2.5 preconsolidation common shares held. The new Cusip number of the common shares is 380887109 and the new ISIN number of the common shares is CA3808871097.
In connection with the transaction, the company paid a finder's fee of 850,000 common shares to an arm's-length finder.
On March 12, 2025, in connection with the transaction, the company completed a non-brokered private placement of 31,200,930 subscription receipts of the company at a price of 15 cents per subscription receipt for aggregate gross proceeds of $4,680,140.
Concurrent with the closing of the transaction, each subscription receipt was deemed to be exercised, without payment of any additional consideration and without further action on the part of the holder thereof, for one common share, and the escrowed subscription funds were released to the company. In connection with the financing, the company paid finders' fees to eligible finders of approximately $173,978.
The net proceeds of the financing will be used to finance (i) expenses of the transaction and the financing, (ii) the exploration and development of the project and (iii) working capital requirements of the company following completion of the transaction.
Concurrent with the completion of the transaction, the company acquired 100 per cent of the issued and outstanding securities of Fundco. Fundco was established by certain investors to finance the deposit paid to the vendor on behalf of the company upon the execution of the definitive agreement and to finance other expenses relating to the transaction.
On Dec. 6, 2024, the company entered into a securities exchange agreement (SEA) with Fundco and each of the securityholders of Fundco. Pursuant to the SEA, all outstanding securities of Fundco were acquired by the company and exchanged for equivalent securities of the company on a 1:1 basis, such that the company issued to the holders of Fundco securities an aggregate of 4,856,667 common shares and 4,856,667 warrants to acquire common shares. Each warrant is exercisable at 25 cents per share for a period of 24 months from the date of issuance.
The Fundco acquisition constitutes a related party transaction (as such term is defined in the policies of the exchange) of the company, as associates (as such term is defined in the policies of the exchange) of Matthew Roma (chief executive officer and a director of the company), and Darryl Cardey (a director of the company), participated in the financing of Fundco and received an aggregate of 750,000 common shares and warrants to purchase 750,000 common shares pursuant to the Fundco acquisition. The participation of such associates in the Fundco acquisition, in each case, constitutes a related party transaction under Multilateral Instrument 61-101 -- Protection of Minority Security Holders in Special Transactions. The company is relying on the exemptions from the valuation requirement and the minority approval requirement set out in subsections 5.5(a) Fair Market Value Not More than 25% of Market Capitalization, and 5.7(1)(a) Fair Market Value not More than 25% of Market Capitalization, of MI 61-101, respectively.
In connection with the closing of the transaction, the company appointed Alan Till as the company's vice-president of exploration, and appointed Nicholas Rowley as an additional independent director. Following the completion of the transaction, the company's board of directors and officers are as follows: Matthew Roma (CEO and director), Cheryll Lingal (chief financial officer), Alan Till (VP exploration), Darryl Cardey (independent director) and Nicholas Rowley (independent director).
Pursuant to the transaction, Currawong Resources Pty. Ltd. transferred a 100-per-cent beneficial interest and all economic rights associated with the exploration licences comprising the project to Providence Gold Pty. Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of BC Subco (as defined above). A transfer of the registered title to the licences was lodged on Feb. 13, 2025. Pending ministerial approval and registration of the transfers, Currawong Resources holds the licences in trust for Providence Gold.
In connection with the transaction, the company completed a comprehensive due diligence review and obtained a legal opinion from its Australian counsel confirming Currawong Resources' 100-per-cent interest in the project. The company also considered operational factors and limitations typical of exploration-stage projects in Australia, including the requirement for landholder consents in certain freehold areas and the potential requirement for a cultural heritage permit under applicable legislation.
The table sets out the issued and outstanding share capital of the company on a non-diluted basis following the completion of the transaction, the financing and the Fundco acquisition.
Category of security Number Percentage Common shares held by the previously existing shareholders of the company (formerly Zincore Metals Inc.) 17,453,270 28.91% Common shares issued to the vendor 6,000,000 9.94% Common shares issued to former Fundco securityholders 4,856,667 8.05% Common shares issued to an arm's-length finder for the transaction 850,000 1.41% Common shares issued upon exercise of subscription receipts pursuant to the financing 31,200,930 51.69% Total: 60,360,867 100%
Concurrently with the completion of the transaction, the company granted 600,000 stock options to certain officers and consultants of the company. Each option is exercisable for one common share at an exercise price of 15 cents per common share for a period of five years from the date of grant. All options were granted pursuant to the company's 10-per-cent rolling option plan and are subject to the terms of the plan, the applicable grant agreements and the requirements of the exchange.
For additional details regarding the transaction and the project, please see the company's news releases dated Dec. 3, 2024, Feb. 13, 2025, March 12, 2025, and April 11, 2025, which are available under the company's SEDAR+ profile.

【特稿】欣喜各界團結 解決住屋難題 - 香港 - 香港文匯網,"助劏戶脫苦海 扶持青年上車
●房屋局的「幸福設計」指引助市民安居。圖為完成外牆粉飾等工程的蝴蝶邨。 資料圖片 現屆特區政府透過新思維推出不少政策，單是房屋局便有簡約公屋及簡樸房等項目。房屋局局長何永賢在專訪中感謝社會各界的支持和協助，「很開心大家心意一致，很有心去解決香港過去十幾年一直在談論的房屋問題，並帶出一個希望，就是即使你現時在劏房住得很辛苦，也很快可以有改善的選擇。」
助劏戶脫苦海 扶持青年上車
她說：「大家看到整套『組合拳』，由推出簡約公屋及繼續做過渡性房屋，然後推進建築科技做傳統的新建公屋，再加上很多房屋政策的調整，全套都可以幫助解決劏房問題。其實是社會各界，不論政黨、專業人士抑或整個建築業，也是大家一起落手落腳去支持，當然還少不了一些社福機構的協助。」
何永賢表示，年輕人過往覺得難以置業，但在現時大量居屋單位推出，以及有很多協助年輕人與其家庭的策略協助下，讓他們可看見希望。至於居於公屋的長者，特區政府也提供很多支援，例如「幸福設計」，從長者角度提出設計概念。
此外，特區政府亦放寬一些以往的措施，例如樓巿已「撤辣」等，何永賢說：「整個房屋政策的每個環節，政府都盡力與社會各界一起多聽、多看，真的是擸起衫袖，見到要做的就去做，希望獲得成果。」

現屆香港特區政府推出多項不同政策解決困擾香港多年的住屋問題，同時透過強化公屋租戶入息與資產制度、推出舉報濫用公屋獎、宣布收緊富戶政策，以及增加居屋綠表比例等，鼓勵富戶置業向上流動，加速公屋單位流轉。特區政府房屋局局長何永賢日前在接受香港文匯報專訪時指出，該套「組合拳」旨在避免寶貴的公屋資源被濫用，現屆政府在接連加強打擊濫用公屋的措施及加大力度宣傳和教育下，截至今年2月底的約兩年半間已收回約8,000個公屋單位，把單位讓給有真正需要的家庭，加上未來5年將有5.5萬個資助出售房屋單位供應以及居屋二手巿場，相信能鼓勵富戶購買。●香港文匯報記者 劉啟業
富戶加租可年減15.5億補貼
何永賢表示，已收回的約8,000個公屋單位，單是以金錢計算已涉及約80億元，「對政府來說十分重要，對輪候公屋人士而言也很重要。」同時，房屋委員會資助房屋小組委員會上月再通過收緊富戶政策，富戶需繳付更多租金，她說：「既然是富戶就可負擔，政府在租金上向富戶補貼很多，這是整個社會共同支付的，加租後房委會每年減少15.5億元補貼，這筆錢數目很大，可用作維修保養及增建更多居屋。」
房委會在收緊富戶政策的同時，亦鼓勵富戶遷出公屋單位向上流動，因此由下一期居屋銷售計劃開始，會將綠白表配額比例由現時4：6調整至5：5，讓更多公屋租戶以綠表資格申請購置居屋單位，且容許租戶無論買入居屋或私樓，置業後仍可居住在公屋單位直至收樓才遷出。富戶遷出後亦可保留綠表資格4年，以申請購買綠置居或居屋單位。
盼推廣「公屋是公共資源」觀念
「希望大家慢慢有『公屋是公共資源』的觀念，明白政府用了很多錢去興建公屋並提供補貼，讓大家住得好、有幸福感，小孩有好的環境去讀書、有好成績，出身後可令整個家庭改善環境。」何永賢強調，富戶需要有上進的活力，不能入住公屋後便繼續停留在舒適圈，因此兩個申報周期即4年若入息限額超額4倍便需要遷出，「整件事就是一套『組合拳』，希望能夠藉此帶出上進上流的觀念。」
何永賢表示，部分公屋富戶其實也想置業，惟未能成功申請居屋單位，欲買私樓又因樓價太貴未能負擔，「問題是過往居屋曾停建10年，富戶只能有居屋這個選擇，因此源源不絕的（資助出售房屋）供應很重要。」
她強調，未來5年加上房協共有5.5萬個資助房屋單位供市民購買，每年均有居屋推售，讓大眾有多一個選擇機會。
除新建居屋外，特區政府亦有措施鼓勵富戶揀選居屋二手市場的單位。何永賢說：「例如將按揭年期由30年變為50年及增加配額，其實居屋二手市場有很多單位均位處地理位置優越的區域，也很受歡迎，希望慢慢將這些可能性活化起來，接下來會繼續吸納各方意見，看看還有什麼可以幫助富戶上進。」
去年施政報告提出未來5年縮短公屋綜合輪候時間至4.5年的目標，北部都會區5年內會有6萬個公營房屋單位落成。
何永賢表示，政府各部門會互相配合做好前期工作，「例如土木工程拓展署做好土地平整工作後便即交給房委會，消防處亦特別成立專隊加快公營房屋的消防設備等檢驗以壓縮程序，提速提效興建公營房屋。」

Florida bill would allow 'wrongful death' lawsuits for preborn children,"Lawmakers in the Florida House passed a bill last week to allow family members to sue for the wrongful death of a preborn child.
HB 1517 allows parents to seek damages if someone causes the death of their preborn child, but it does not allow action against the mother or doctor in cases of legal abortion. The bill allows a jury to award monetary damages equal to the wages that a preborn child may have earned. It passed the House with a vote of 79-32, while its Senate companion, SB 1284, passed the Senate Appropriations Committee on Criminal and Civil Justice.
Though Florida already allows a murder charge against the fetus in instances in which a mother and her preborn child are killed — something that is not guaranteed in all states — this new legislation would further allow parents to seek damages if the actions of another cause a preborn child’s death.
Senate sponsor Sen. Erin Grall emphasized that the bill is “not about abortion.”
“To me, this is about parity in our civil justice system,” Grall said.
“This is a life issue. I think it’s pretty apparent,” added Sen. Blaise Ingoglia. “We have plenty of places in Florida statute where we value the unborn child and what this does is just makes it consistent.”
READ: DEFUND Planned Parenthood: Women say staff physically and mentally coerced them to abort
Many Democratic lawmakers opposed the bill, with concern that it would impact IVF and abortion while conferring fetal personhood on preborn children. Abortion advocates don’t like to recognize preborn children as “persons,” because doing so gives legal recognition to those children who are brutally killed by abortion.
“There is a serious concern that there are other motivations here behind this bill, specifically with respect to abortion, with respect to potentially IVF in the future,” said Democratic Sen. Tina Polsky. “This is setting a new base for future issues, for future liability, for future bans. And it’s incredibly concerning.”
Despite the desire to refrain from recognizing the fetus as a person, the preborn child is a unique human from the very moment of conception. The humanity and personhood of the preborn child are not dependent on a legal definition.
Those against abortion are advocating that the bill be further strengthened by removing the abortion exemption.
“That protective carve-out for the abortion industry must be removed from the bill,” said Andrew Shirvell of Florida Voice for the Unborn. “It is completely unnecessary and will make it harder for parents to recover damages from bad actors posing as health care providers.”",2025-04-17T00:40:00.000+03:00,https://www.liveaction.org/news/florida-lawsuits-wrongful-death-preborn,Bridget Sielicki,positive

Jeffries backs stock trading ban previously shunned by Pelosi - Washington Examiner,"House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) extended his support for banning Congress members from inside stock trading, a matter former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) used to oppose.
The bipartisan matter has lingered for a long time, with broad public support . The most recent action came from Democrats after many of them accused Republicans of “market manipulation” following President Donald Trump’s push to buy ahead of the pause on his “reciprocal” tariffs.
“So many of these people are crooks, liars, and frauds. And Marjorie Taylor Greene is, of course, exhibit A,” Jeffries said Monday on MSNBC after Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) allegedly bought tens of thousands of dollars in stock the day before and the day of Trump’s pause on his sweeping tariffs.
“One, we do need to change the law so that sitting members of Congress cannot trade stock, period. Full stop,” Jeffries continued. “And until we get to that point, we obviously have to continue to highlight why this is problematic. And if Republicans are unwilling to hold a hearing on this matter, I can assure you Democrats will, on Capitol Hill, in partnership with the Senate. And we also will take this matter on the road.”
Jeffries has mostly aligned with Pelosi on major issues since she stepped down from leading House Democrats. Pelosi, who wrote off the matter for a long period of time, seemed to back down on her staunch opinions ahead of the 2022 midterm elections.
Pelosi, whose husband is a multimillionaire investor who regularly makes large trades, opposed previous legislation, saying we live in a “free market economy.” However, in 2022, she softened her opposition against the measure, saying she would be “ okay with it ” if that’s what Democratic lawmakers wanted.
“No one should come to Congress to make a profit. Americans want to see a stock ban, and as a co-sponsor of the bipartisan TRUST in Congress Act, I’m glad to see Leader Jeffries voice support for a ban,” Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA) told the Washington Examiner .
Many Republicans, including Greene, who were accused of acting on inside information, pushed back by saying their stock exchanges were in a blind trust.
Jeffries is not the only Democratic leader who has weighed in on this matter since Trump’s “Liberation Day.” His appearance on MSNBC came after Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), along with other Senate Democratic colleagues, called on the Securities and Exchange Commission to investigate Trump’s possible “tariff market manipulation” regarding insider trading.
“We urge the SEC to investigate whether the tariff announcements, which caused the market crash and subsequent partial recovery, enriched administration insiders and friends at the expense of the American public and whether any insiders, including the President’s family, had prior knowledge of the tariff pause that they abused to make stock trades ahead of the President’s announcement,” the senators said.
“Before pausing the tariffs that threw markets into disarray, President Trump appears to have previewed his plans to do so on Truth Social: at 9:37 am, he announced, “THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO BUY!!! DJT.” His official announcement of the tariff pause came roughly 4 hours later at 1:18 pm,” they said .
As they work to win the House in the 2026 midterm elections, banning congressional stock trading could be a major play for Democrats as they search for messaging that resonates with voters, especially after the market turmoil following Trump’s tariffs.
Although Democrats are messaging on the matter now, many Republicans are also on board with the stock trading ban. The right flank of the GOP party, the House Freedom Caucus, included a stock trading ban on its list of necessary legislation in a letter earlier this year following the speaker race. House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) has remained quiet on the matter and does not own any individual stocks, according to his ethics disclosures.
This longtime issue has had many pushes but has never been fully successful. The STOCK Act, signed into law in 2012, prohibits members from acting on insider information and requires them to report their trades within 45 days, but the law acts more as a slap on the wrist. The penalty is a mere $200 fine, and members have not been punished for said violations.
Earlier this year, Reps. Chip Roy (R-TX) and Seth Magaziner (D-RI) reintroduced the TRUST Act , which would ban Congress members, their spouses, and dependent children from trading individual stocks. The piece of legislation has 63 cosponsors as of Wednesday .
AOC RAISES NEARLY $10 MILLION IN FIRST QUARTER, SMASHING RECORD
Last year, a group of bipartisan senators, including Jon Ossoff (D-GA), Gary Peters (D-MI), Josh Hawley (R-MO), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), and Jacky Rosen (D-NV), introduced legislation that passed out of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee to ban stock trading for sitting Congress members, marking the first time a bill with this language passed out of committee. Ossoff has introduced similar legislation multiple times, but none have crossed the finish line.
“Members of Congress should not be here to turn a profit on the people’s time. They should certainly not be trading or owning individual stocks, especially not in companies they oversee through their government work,” Hawley said in a press release following committee passage.

"Hochul, DAs say NY discovery law deal is 'very, very close' in budget breakthrough","Let’s make a whatever-you-call-it.
Gov. Kathy Hochul acknowledged Wednesday that lawmakers had reached a breakthrough in negotiations to revamp the state’s discovery laws — even as she insisted it didn’t count as a “deal.”
The governor instead opted for wonky jargon, describing the end of a budget stalemate revealed the day before by Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie (D-Bronx) as a “conceptual agreement” different from a done deal.
“I think we’re very, very close to being done and perhaps, today will be the day we say, ‘Pens are down,'” Hochul said during a news conference.
3 Gov. Kathy Hochul said Wednesday that lawmakers are “very, very close” on a deal for changing discovery laws. Robert Miller Hochul plans to meet with Heastie and Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins (D-Westchester) Wednesday evening.
A deal — or a deal by another name — likely will clear a major logjam to passing New York’s massive $252 proposed budget, which has been held up for weeks by Hochul refusing to budge on her policy asks, especially changes to discovery
Hochul stopped short of voicing support for the plan crafted by Albany Democrats and approved by all five New York City district attorneys.
But rumors swirled around Albany after the deal was announced Tuesday that it was falling apart, prompting Heastie to clear the air.
“Everything is still fine conceptually. Staff is going back and forth on drafting,” Heastie told The Post.
3 Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie swatted down rumors that the deal was on the ropes. Zuma / SplashNews.com While Hochul contended there’s no deal over discovery, last year she unveiled the state budget deal by calling it the “parameters of a conceptual agreement” — almost the exact same term Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez used to describe the state of play on discovery.
Changing discovery laws was one of Hochul’s big priorities in the budget talks with state lawmakers, along with making it easier to involuntarily commit mentally ill people — a pair of policy pitches that grew from public safety concerns in the Big Apple.
The city’s DAs, including Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, argued that the state’s 2019 discovery reforms led to a surge in criminal case dismissals based on often-trivial technicalities.
Hochul backed their proposal to tweak the laws, narrowing the scope of evidence prosecutors have to turn over to defense attorneys and setting a 35-day time limit to challenge violations.
Critics such as The Legal Aid Society, however, pushed lawmakers to stand firm against the changes — contending they’d give prosecutors too much power. They also argued the surge in dismissals is largely seen in New York City and stems from the NYPD failing to share evidence with prosecutors.
Despite the pushback, Heastie said Tuesday that Dems had reached a “framework” over discovery changes.
The deal would:
Require prosecutors to just turn over evidence “relevant” to charges, narrowing it from evidence “related” to the case, Clarify that judges should only dismiss cases in which prosecutors did not exercise “due diligence,” Require defense attorneys to file discovery challenges within 35 days of prosecutors certifying to the court they’ve turned over evidence. 3 Three of New York City’s district attorneys — Manhattan’s Alvin Bragg, Brooklyn’s Eric Gonzalez and Staten Island’s Michael McMahon — flanked Hochul during Wednesday’s news conference. Robert Miller Three of New York City’s district attorneys — Gonzalez, Bragg and Staten Island’s Michael McMahon — flanked Hochul during her news conference, which was part of a tour pushing for the discovery changes.
Gonzalez said the legislative teams from the DAs and Heastie’s and Stewart-Cousin’s offices were crafting the actual language for changes.
“Every word matters in a statute, because if a word is off or a standard is off, it changes the entire interpretation,” he said.
“We want to make sure that the language is clear that judges will have discretion to independently and individually review each case, and that a judge would not feel that they have to dismiss a case because a document is missing.”",2025-04-17T00:52:00.000+03:00,https://nypost.com/2025/04/16/us-news/hochul-das-say-ny-discovery-law-deal-is-very-very-close-in-budget-breakthrough,"Published April 16, 2025, 5:52 p.m. ET Let's make a whatever-you-call-it.

City leaders announce efforts to stop human trafficking in Jacksonville,"JACKSONVILLE, Fla. – Whether you’re aware or not, the person to your left or right could be a survivor or victim of human trafficking. It’s a disgusting reality, an often-invisible issue that’s happening right here in Jacksonville.
RELATED: Revealing the myths of human trafficking: It happens where you live
It’s a sense of pride in American culture to be self-sufficient, but Silvia Almond, the President of the Jacksonville chapter of Save Our Adolescents from Prostitution (SOAP), said that it can be hindering when it comes to the topic of human trafficking.
“The American culture is so self-sufficient I can protect myself. This is not going to happen to me. No way. It’s gonna happen in my neighborhood. It’s nothing happened in the school. It happened somewhere else,” Almond said.
It’s true this happens all over the world, but it’s also happening here in Jacksonville.
For over two decades, Almond has been an advocate to stop the invisible issue and for 17 years, she’s been doing everything she can to stop it here in Jacksonville.
“But I started by myself, hands on, asking for nothing, saying let me see, How can I help,“ Almond said passionately, ”I’ve been blessed that I never have any of those issues, but my heart was always going to help people.”
While she’s helped women overseas, in South Carolina and now Florida, she said this isn’t just in one area.
“People don’t realize that those houses people live in, it’s happening in there,” Almond said.
Almond is going to Jacksonville-area hotels to raise awareness. She said what America thinks of as a “brothel” is only what we see on TV or in the movies, but in all actuality, the real brothels in America are the hotels.
“The girls are all by themselves,” Almond said. “They have a lot of cash, a lot of money, they stand there in the lobby for, they don’t look like a prostitute, they look like normal girls.”
She leaves a package to a hotel manager explaining what the mission is, flyers of the current missing children in the Jacksonville area as well as flyers with human trafficking signs and prevention. They even have bars of soap and makeup remover wipes that can be given to housekeeping to put in rooms or in the lobby bathroom, with ways for victims to contact someone for help.

But the second most popular place where this is happening is online through gaming and apps.
“It’s not like the movies say. It’s not like the TV says, they’re going to snatch you. They’re gonna take you down. That’s a 0.1% of the snatching of them. They really have a grooming process,” Almond said.
Almond said groomers are even on social media. She said she teaches parents how to talk about human trafficking with their children.
“They want somebody to listen to them. They want somebody to sit with them. They want affection from parents,” Almond said.
In April, Ohio passed a law that makes child grooming for sexual abuse a criminal offense. Almond is hoping something similar will be considered in Florida.
The law classifies grooming as a misdemeanor, with the potential for felony charges for repeat offenders or if the child is under 13 years old.

Sunnyside Vision Plan to Transform Commercial Corridor,"BIDs in Brownsville, Brooklyn; Sunnyside, Queens; and the Bronx Capitol District published Vision Plans for the future of their public spaces, after 12 months of community engagement and collaboration with designers. The Vision Plans from Pitkin Avenue BID, Sunnyside Shines BID, and 161st Street BID lay out a blueprint for how to reimagine public spaces in their commercial corridors through installations, programming, and capital improvements. The BIDs received funding, technical assistance, and consultation with city agencies through the Local Center, a partnership between Urban Design Forum and the Association for Neighborhood & Housing Development (“ANHD”).
The BIDs worked with teams of designers to construct creative improvements to their public spaces to drive foot traffic and strengthen neighborhood connectivity and safety. They engaged 100+ residents, small businesses, and community stakeholders in each neighborhood to understand local priorities for public space. The teams tested those ideas in Summer and Fall 2024 through short-term activations like lighting installations, night markets, and shading structures in plazas and parks. These and other ideas are captured in the BIDs’ Vision Plans.
The plans include short- and long-term strategies for transforming the districts’ public spaces to reflect the identities and priorities of local businesses, artists, and residents. Each BID will work with community stakeholders and city agencies to advocate for additional investment and support to advance these strategies in 2025 and beyond.
By directing more investment into comprehensive vision planning and lively public spaces in under-invested commercial corridors, this initiative helps further the New York Governor and New York City Mayor’s “New” New York Action Plan to reinvigorate New York City’s business districts and amplify cultural and economic vibrancy in public spaces across the boroughs.
Sunnyside Shines Business Improvement District, serving Sunnyside, Queens, worked with di Domenico + Partners and the Queens Lighting Collective to produce the Sunnyside Vision Plan focused on transforming underutilized areas, including the plazas and parking bays underneath the 7 train and Sabba Park, into vibrant spaces that reflect the neighborhood’s diverse communities, encourage community interaction, and stimulate local businesses. In 2025, the BID will advance vision plan ideas for night markets and performance space in Lowery Plaza and a new lighting installation on Greenpoint Avenue.
“This was a wonderful opportunity to reconceptualize the use of our public spaces in Sunnyside and have structured conversations on how to improve the spaces and maximize their use by the community,” said Dirk McCall de Palomá, Executive Director of Sunnyside Shines BID. “We are incredibly grateful to the Urban Design Forum, ANHD, and all of their funders, especially the NYC Department of Small Business Services (SBS) for teaming us up with a design firm and a lighting firm to embark upon this process together. It was incredibly helpful and will result in improvements to our public spaces and have deepened our connections to our local community.”",2025-04-17T00:42:00.000+03:00,https://www.qgazette.com/articles/sunnyside-vision-plan-to-transform-commercial-corridor,qgazette,positive
Aprobaron la propuesta para desplegar fuerzas federales en los lugares con mayor cantidad de homicidios - LA NACION,"El Gobierno nacional aprobó el plan para desplegar efectivos de las fuerzas federales de seguridad en las zonas donde se registraron los mayores índices de homicidios en el país. La resolución 448 del Ministerio de Seguridad Nacional apuntó a focalizar la intervención del Estado en el 10% de los municipios del país. Se trata de sectores que concentran el 70% de la población nacional y el 90% de los homicidios dolosos. El denominado Plan Territorial de Reducción de Homicidios y Violencia Relacionada o Plan 90/10 formó parte del esquema estratégico de seguridad lanzado por la ministra Patricia Bullrich en diciembre de 2024, que permitió alcanzar una tasa de homicidios de 3,8 cada 100.000 habitantes, la más baja en 25 años.
La resolución fue publicada hoy en el Boletín Oficial y fue elaborada a partir del análisis del mapa de los asesinatos en la Argentina que reveló que los homicidios están frecuentemente asociados a otras formas de violencia, como la intrafamiliar y la juvenil.
“Estas violencias, a su vez, retroalimentan un ciclo que aumenta la probabilidad de incidentes letales, por lo que es fundamental abordar estas dinámicas para tener un impacto sostenible en la reducción de homicidios”, se consignó en la resolución.
Entre los objetivos del plan figuran la reducción de los factores de riesgo, desarrollar políticas de prevención y fortalecer los vínculos de confianza entre las comunidades y las fuerzas de seguridad federales.

Senate passes bill allowing safe surrender of infants,"The Senate has passed by a vote of 33-4 a measure that would allow newborn infants to be placed inside boxes at certain locations to prevent them from harm.
Ocala Republican Sen. Stan McClain presented the bill ( SB 1690 ), which substituted Eustis Republican Rep. Nan Cobb’s companion bill ( HB 791 ).
“It allows parents an alternative to surrender their infant in an infant safety device and avoids the possibility of abandonment,” McClain said of the bill. “The bill also allows for hospitals and EMS stations, and fire stations to have the device onsite.”
During the bill’s debate, Boynton Beach Democratic Sen. Lori Berman said she would not be voting “yes” on the bill and noted that other devices that have already been installed around the state have not been utilized.
“I’ve seen this bill in three committees, and I voted ‘no’ every time,” Berman said. “I’m going to be voting ‘no’ again today. We put these baby boxes into law several years ago, and it’s been used one time. One time in two years. And there is one manufacturer who makes these baby boxes.”
Berman added that she thinks the legislation is unnecessary because there are already existing laws that allow a parent to surrender their child.
“I don’t see why we need these. We already have a procedure in law. If you want to drop an infant off, you can drop them off at the fire station, you can drop them off at the hospital,” Berman said. “I will continue to be a ‘no’ on this bill.”
Jacksonville Democratic Sen. Tracie Davis also said she was against the bill, adding that she has concerns about some of the language around anonymity.
“I will be joining my colleague and voting ‘no’ against this. She’s laid out a number of challenges. I think we both have. The additional one that I would like to add is the fact that we have a 24-hour surveillance system, and most of these places where a baby is being dropped off, but we also talk about the person having anonymous surrender,” Davis said.
“That’s a conflict for me. We have cameras set up at fire stations. There’s cameras at hospitals. And if the person is going to be anonymous turning in a child, then they’re being captured on camera,” Davis added. “So, the anonymous factor is truly not there, and I’ll also be voting ‘no’ on this bill.”
Palm Harbor Republican Sen. Ed Hooper supported the bill and noted that during his time spent in fire stations, infants would be dropped at the front door, but those working inside would often not realize a baby was there because there was no alarm system.
“Every station I was at had a big sign out front, yellow sign, ‘safe place.’ You were encouraged to drop your baby off at the front door of the office. Guess which door never gets used by a fire station employee? The front door of the office,” Hooper said.
Hooper said he thinks the new measure would be better than a simple safe place at a fire station or EMS station.
“A person could drop off a newborn at that door with no alarm, if you didn’t hear the cry of the child, you would never know that a child was there,” Hooper said.
“I think this bill takes that step. And there’s no guarantee that a malfunction will never occur, but the fact that that system has an alarm that goes off and is inside of that safe structure gives me the comfort to know this is better than ‘safe place’ by leaps and bounds.”
In closing, McClain said no one would be mandated to install an infant safety device, but they would be able to if they wanted.
“For me, it’s always about if we can save one life, and I believe that this is a safe system,” McClain said.
“It’s in 300 locations throughout the United States; there’s two of them currently in my county. There’s one actually in another county that I now am Senator of, in Levy County. They just installed one there, and we’ve seen that this system has been safe and that it has worked, and it’s monitored 24 hours a day. It’s tested twice a week; there’s a whole set of protocols that go along with that any time a local government decides that they want to do something like this. We’re not mandating anybody to do anything.”",2025-04-17T00:47:00.000+03:00,https://floridapolitics.com/archives/732734-senate-passes-bill-allowing-safe-surrender-of-infants,Andrew Powell,positive

川普執政美俄關係改善　普丁稱讚馬斯克如蘇聯太空英雄,"▲圖為2019年6月，時任美國總統川普和俄羅斯總統普丁在日本大阪的G20峰會上見面。（圖／路透）
記者葉國吏／綜合報導
俄羅斯總統普丁（Vladimir Putin）今日在鮑曼莫斯科國立科技大學（Bauman Moscow State Technical University）向大學生發表談話時，稱讚億萬富豪馬斯克（Elon Musk），認為他可與蘇聯時期的傳奇火箭工程師卡洛勒夫（Sergei Korolev）相媲美。
法新社報導指出，普丁提到馬斯克對火星的著迷，並表示「這種人通常不會出現在人類群體中，他們滿腦子都是某些想法」。普丁認為馬斯克的想法即使在今日看似難以置信，往往會在一段時間後實現，就像蘇聯先驅者卡洛勒夫的想法一樣。
卡洛勒夫被視為蘇聯太空計畫之父，設計了首顆「史普尼克」（Sputnik）衛星及載人太空船「東方一號」（Vostok 1）。這艘太空船於1961年升空，讓蘇聯太空人加加林（Yuri Gagarin）成為進入太空的史上第一人。
馬斯克則是美國太空探索科技公司（SpaceX）暨特斯拉（Tesla）執行長，他在川普政府中扮演重要角色。馬斯克時常批評烏克蘭，上月更指控烏克蘭總統澤倫斯基（Volodymyr Zelensky）想要一場「永遠的戰爭」。",2025-04-17T00:51:00.000+03:00,https://www.ettoday.net/news/20250417/2944622.htm,ETtoday新聞雲,positive
"Venezuela respalda la ""firme respuesta"" de Claudia Sheinbaum a los aranceles de EE.UU. - Banca y Negocios","Venezuela respalda la ""firme respuesta"" de Claudia Sheinbaum a los aranceles de EE.UU.
Durante una reunión, el canciller venezolano Yván Gil y el embajador mexicano en Caracas, Leopoldo de Gyves, revisaron la agenda bilateral y reafirmaron «el compromiso mutuo de no interferir en los asuntos internos».
Venezuela respaldó este miércoles la «firme respuesta» de la presidenta de México, Claudia Sheinbaum, a la política arancelaria del mandatario de Estados Unidos, Donald Trump, cuyo Gobierno impuso tasas del 25% al acero, aluminio y a la industria automotriz de ese país latinoamericano, así como a los productos fuera del tratado de libre comercio T-MEC.
A través de Telegram, el titular de Exteriores venezolano, Yván Gil, informó de una reunión con el embajador mexicano en Caracas, Leopoldo de Gyves, a quien expresó su reconocimiento a Sheinbaum y a su «destacada gestión y firme respuesta ante la imposición de aranceles».
Según el mensaje del canciller, ambos funcionarios revisaron durante el encuentro la agenda bilateral y reafirmaron «el compromiso mutuo de no interferir en los asuntos internos», así como su disposición a «trabajar conjuntamente» para profundizar la integración regional.
La semana pasada, en la IX Reunión de la Comunidad de Estados Latinoamericanos y Caribeños (Celac), Sheinbaum propuso convocar una ‘Cumbre por el Bienestar Económico’ de la región, como respuesta a la guerra comercial y en pro de una mayor integración en esta materia.
En el evento, la mandataria consideró que la región tiene todo para fortalecerse por sí misma, incluida una población joven de 663 millones de habitantes, un PIB de 6,6 billones de dólares y abundantes recursos naturales.
Cuando el pasado 2 de abril Trump anunció lo que llamó «aranceles recíprocos» que implicaron tasas generalizadas del 10% y unos volúmenes superiores para otras regiones y países -como China o la Unión Europea (UE)- que exportan mucho a EE.UU., México y Canadá quedaron fuera de la lista de países castigados.
Este lunes, Sheinbaum aseguró que su Gobierno busca negociar una reducción en materia de aranceles con EE.UU. en los sectores automotriz, de acero y aluminio.

东安动力预计一季报扭亏为盈,"东安动力 （ 600178 ）（600178）4月16日晚披露2025年一季度业绩预盈公告，公司预计2025年第一季度实现净利润在360万元左右，与上年同期相比实现扭亏为盈。东安动力一季报业绩预盈的主要原因是本期产量增加，单位产品固定成本摊销减少。
　　东安动力拥有自然吸气、增压直喷和新能源增程动力三大发动机产品平台以及手动变速器、自动变速器和DHT三大变速器产品平台，包括M、N、D系列发动机和AT、DHT变速器，致力于为高端乘用车、轻型和中型商用车、新能源汽车等提供发动机、变速器及动力总成一体化解决方案。
　　东安动力4月7日晚披露2024年年度报告，报告期内，公司实现营业收入46.18亿元，同比下降14.55%；实现净利润573万元，同比增长41.39%；基本每股收益0.01元。分配预案为每10股派发现金人民币0.05元（含税）。
　　东安动力4月16日披露投资者关系活动记录表显示，公司于4月15日通过电话会议接受了中银基金的调研。
　　公司近两年产品以传统发动机和增程式发动机为主，变速器方面主要是6AT变速箱。今年开始，DHT产品将小批量生产。东安动力介绍，2024年发动机和变速器销量49.35万台，较2023年有较大下降，主要受商用车市场低迷影响，尤其是轻卡领域电动化渗透加快，导致公司市场占有率下降，未完成年初目标。
　　东安动力称，公司现有产能能够满足市场需求，且产能均可通过节拍优化、延长工作时间等提升。另外，公司基于产能利用情况，筹划后续生产线建设，公司厂区有预留场地。2022~2024年公司投资新基地建设，用于增程产品生产线建设，其间投资较大。2025年投资规模较小，后续公司可根据需要，进行产能提升。
　　乘用车发动机方面，东安动力主要客户为长安汽车，2024年为长安汽车配套的2.0T发动机约10万台以上。此外还为东风岚图配套1.5T增程发动机，主要应用于东风岚图FREE车型。商用车发动机主要配套轻卡，客户主要为 福田汽车 （ 600166 ）、河北长安等。
　　当前发动机行业毛利普遍较低，近几年，公司毛利率因销量下降、生产线折旧增加以及会计科目调整等因素影响，持续下降。随着销量提升，毛利率有望提升。乘用车毛利率相对商用车稍好，新品毛利率初期表现不佳，后续随量增加有望改善。变速器业务毛利率相对高一些，主要是海外市场表现较好。
　　2024年，东安动力海外业务收入占公司营业收入的比例为15%，产品主要为自动变速器。2025年，公司将实现发动机和变速器的整体出口，海外收入有望进一步提高，公司规划长远目标为海外业务收入占比达到30%。",2025-04-17T00:52:00.000+03:00,http://stock.10jqka.com.cn/20250417/c667524215.shtml,证券时报,positive
Expand Energy Joins EQT in Triple-Investment-Grade Credit-Rating Club,"Expand Energy has joined EQT Corp. in the triple-investment-grade credit-rating club.
Moody’s Ratings issued a revised score April 16, following Fitch Ratings and S&P Global Ratings, which revised their grades on Expand’s debt profile to investment grade in October.
The Fitch and S&P revisions were made upon Expand’s formation Oct. 1 when Chesapeake Energy closed its merger with fellow Appalachian and Haynesville pureplay gas producer Southwestern Energy, becoming the largest U.S. gas producer.
The new Moody’s rating lifts Expand’s debt rating to Baa3 from the speculative-grade Ba1. The Fitch and S&P upgrades were each to BBB-, up from the speculative BB+.
Moody’s vice president and senior credit officer Amol Joshi reported, ""The upgrade to Baa3 acknowledges Expand Energy's progress in reducing debt since its merger with Southwestern and expected further deleveraging to achieve its net debt target of approximately $4.5 billion, aided by attractively priced hedges on a meaningful portion of its natural gas production through 2026.""
Joshi added, ""Expand's merger with Southwestern completed last year consolidates its scale in some of the core natural gas producing regions and improves its cash flow durability.""
Expand Energy did not provide a comment on the news by press time.
AI data center, LNG
EQT CFO Jeremy Knop said in a February investor call that generative AI data center operators and LNG buyers require their gas suppliers have investment-grade ratings, which EQT has.
“That's not really a pervasive theme with many of our peers or really any of them at this point, especially across all three [rating] agencies.”
EQT’s negotiated position is boosted by the fact that its gas is net zero in Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions, he added, as well as that it is both a gas producer and midstream operator.
Still, he added, “a lot of it comes down to counterparty credit risk.”
A 1 GW generative AI data center could use 1 million Nvidia H100 chips, which could cost $30 billion based on the current market price.
“If you're the tech company building that, you're not going to compromise with a non-investment-grade counterparty, period,” Knop said. “You just don't take that risk.”
At the time among pureplay gas producers, “it's kind of just EQT because we don't really have any [other producer] who can provide really the rest of those attributes as part of negotiating one of these deals.”

House approves legislation to modernize WA's recycling system - NewsBreak,"(The Center Square) – The Washington State House of Representatives has approved a bill designed to modernize the state’s recycling system by shifting responsibility to producers to ensure a more efficient and sustainable approach to solid waste management. But not everyone is on board. Engrossed Second Substitute Senate Bill 5284 , known as the Recycling Reform Act, passed the House Monday on a 51-45 vote. It aims to improve solid waste management by establishing a statewide recycling program and implementing extended producer responsibility for consumer packaging and paper products. This means manufacturers and brands would be responsible for funding and managing the recycling of their packaging, shifting costs from consumers to producers. Other provisions of the bill include increased access to recycling across Washington, where currently 58% of jurisdictions provide access to curbside recycling; 11 counties have no curbside recycling at all. The bill was amended in the House. That means it now goes back to the Senate for a concurrence vote before it can be signed into law by the governor. “The passage of this bill represents a historic step forward for our state to a cleaner, more accessible, and more sustainable recycling system,” Sen. Liz Lovelett, D-Anacortes, the bill’s prime sponsor, said in a news release . “Today we are all celebrating progress to reduce pollution, improve recycling rates, and divert materials away from landfills.” Not everyone is celebrating what would be a major overhaul of the state's recycling system bankrolled by companies that make single-use packaging. That includes Brad Lovaas, executive director of the Washington Refuse & Recycling Association, a statewide trade association representing the solid waste and recycling industry in Washington. “As the solid waste and recycling companies proudly partnering with Washingtonians to achieve a recycling rate of 49%-50% above the national average, we are disappointed that the Legislature is moving forward to toss aside our state’s affordable, effective and local recycling system in favor of an expensive, unproven approach run by multinational packaging companies,” Lovaas said in a statement emailed to The Center Square.” He went on to say, “We continue to believe that our state should conduct a Needs Assessment before prescribing a massive investment while short on data and results in the United States. As proposed in this legislation, the cost of common grocery items will go up at a time of already record inflation as the packaging companies pass on their higher costs to consumers.” If the bill becomes law, Washington will become the seventh state to adopt laws establishing extended producer responsibility, or EPR, for the packaging, joining Maine, Oregon, California, Colorado, Maryland and Minnesota. EPR programs are designed to ensure producers take responsibility for reducing the environmental impact of packaging. Under the legislation, EPR would be fully implemented in the state by 2030.",2025-04-17T00:25:00.000+03:00,https://www.newsbreak.com/the-center-square-509740/3965884543852-house-approves-legislation-to-modernize-wa-s-recycling-system,Brett Davis | The Center Square,positive

Senador de Estados Unidos exige liberar a salvadoreño deportado por error y encarcelado en megacárcel,"Senador de Estados Unidos exige liberar a salvadoreño deportado por error y encarcelado en megacárcel
Senador Van Hollen exige en El Salvador la liberación de Kilmar Ábrego, deportado por error y sin cargos.
San Salvador, 16 de abril de 2025. — El senador demócrata Chris Van Hollen viajó a El Salvador para exigir la liberación de Kilmar Ábrego García, un salvadoreño que fue deportado por error desde Estados Unidos y permanece detenido en una megacárcel junto a peligrosos criminales, pese a no tener antecedentes penales.
Negativa del gobierno salvadoreño a cooperar
A su llegada, el legislador fue recibido por el vicepresidente salvadoreño Félix Ulloa, quien le informó que no podría autorizar ni una llamada ni una visita con Ábrego.
¿Por qué debería el gobierno de Estados Unidos pagar al gobierno de El Salvador para que encarcele a un hombre que fue secuestrado ilegalmente en Estados Unidos y que no cometió ningún delito?,
— cuestionó Van Hollen ante medios locales.

Aunque la Corte Suprema de Estados Unidos y la jueza federal Paula Xinis ordenaron facilitar el regreso de Ábrego, el gobierno de Nayib Bukele ha rechazado dicha solicitud. Incluso, durante una reciente reunión en la Casa Blanca con el expresidente Donald Trump, Bukele afirmó que no tiene planes de permitir el retorno del joven salvadoreño.
I just met with the Vice President of El Salvador as we fight for the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia. I’m speaking to the press now with the latest on our efforts.
— Senator Chris Van Hollen (@ChrisVanHollen)
Tune in here:[https://t.co/lkB5v8BQEe][April 16, 2025]
Errores, acusaciones infundadas y detenciones masivas
Kilmar Ábrego, de 29 años, huyó de la violencia pandillera a los 16 años. En 2019 obtuvo protección legal en Estados Unidos y nunca ha sido acusado de ningún delito, según sus abogados. Sin embargo, fue deportado en medio de un operativo masivo impulsado por el gobierno de Trump, en el que cientos de personas, en su mayoría venezolanos, fueron enviados a El Salvador sin pruebas, bajo la antigua Ley de Enemigos Extranjeros de 1798.

Las personas detenidas no han tenido acceso a abogados ni contacto con el exterior. Los vuelos continuaron a pesar de una orden judicial que los prohibía, lo que ha derivado en amenazas de desacato contra funcionarios de la anterior administración estadounidense.
Persisten los esfuerzos por lograr justicia
“La razón de mi visita es abogar por la liberación de Kilmar Ábrego García”, escribió Van Hollen en la red X.
Le prometí a su familia que haría todo lo posible por traerlo de regreso y así será.
Mientras tanto, las autoridades estadounidenses intentan continuar el diálogo. Se espera que el secretario de Defensa de Estados Unidos, Pete Hegseth, se reúna este mismo miércoles con el ministro de Defensa Nacional de El Salvador, René Merino, en el Pentágono.

"N.S., N.B. premiers in Ontario to encourage free trade","Nova Scotia and New Brunswick have signed memorandums of understanding to remove trade barriers between themselves and Ontario.
A news release from the Ontario government says these agreements will bolster interprovincial trade.
“Ontario will also work with Nova Scotia and with New Brunswick on a framework for direct-to-consumer alcohol (DTC) sales, so that producers have easier access to new market opportunities, and so that consumers have greater choice and access to a broader selection of alcoholic beverages,” the release says. “This collaboration will enhance economic resilience, create job opportunities and set a precedent for other provinces to follow.”
In February, Nova Scotia Premier Tim Houston introduced legislation to help remove trade barriers and spur greater investments opportunities with other Canadian provinces and territories who pass similar legislation.
Houston said “The Free Trade and Mobility within Canada Act” is meant to signal to other Canadian jurisdictions that Nova Scotia is “open for business.”
“This legislation just makes sense,” said Houston, who is also the minister of Trade for the province. “It will allow goods and services to be sold in Nova Scotia without further testing or red tape and puts trust in other provinces and territories that have appropriate requirements to keep people safe.”
The act is reciprocal and requires other provinces to agree to terms and pass similar legislation, which Ontario Premier Doug Ford indicated he’s on board with at the time.
“There is a goal, a challenge, that has been laid down across the country of free trade in Canada, full free trade in Canada, and across Canada by Canada Day. I don’t know if we’ll make that goal, but Nova Scotia is all in,” said Houston.
On Wednesday the Ontario government said it would introduce the “Protect Ontario through Free Trade within Canada Act,” which focuses on labour mobility and free trade.
Interprovincial exports contribute to roughly 17 per cent of Nova Scotia’s gross domestic product and with trade to other provinces being valued at nearly $29 billion in 2023.
“Today we’re taking a historic step forward to protect and unify our country ... to build on Canada’s economy by tearing down internal trade barriers. The cost to these barriers to our economy is absolutely enormous,” said Ford.
Robert Huish, an international development studies associate professor at Halifax’s Dalhousie University, closely studies sanctions and tariffs. He says Wednesday’s agreement is a good first step.
“These tariffs aren’t necessarily intentional to try and reduce trade between provinces, but they are there and they are having an impact,” said Huish.
While legislation is key to reducing trade barriers, Huish says Canada lacks the infrastructure to support seamless trade across the country.
“We do not have a rail or highway network that connects the country anywhere near to what the United States does,” he said.
New Brunswick
In a separate news release, New Brunswick Premier Susan Holt said knocking down interprovincial trade barriers is one of “the four pillars” of the province’s response to U.S. tariffs.
“Ontario is New Brunswick’s second-biggest trading partner, and we are excited to be building on the positive momentum to reduce internal trade barriers across Canada,” said Holt. “Today’s signing of this bilateral memorandum of understanding commits both jurisdictions to enhance direct-to-consumer alcohol sales and improve interprovincial labour mobility.
“It will also encourage the free flow of goods, services and investment, all while maintaining and strengthening public safety.”
Last month, the New Brunswick government introduced amendments to the “Fair Registration Practices in Regulated Professions Act” that, if passed, would allow workers in regulated professions to start working in new jurisdictions during the registration process.
Prince Edward Island
Earlier this month, the Prince Edward Island government introduced the “Interprovincial Trade and Mobility Act,” which is similar to Nova Scotia’s legislation.
“Leaders across the country are expressing interest in removing trade barriers, and I’m very pleased that P.E.I. and Ontario have tabled legislation to remove all their trade barriers,” said Houston. “This is a significant moment for our country, and these actions say a lot about our commitment to make our economies stronger.”",2025-04-17T00:44:00.000+03:00,https://www.cp24.com:443/news/canada/2025/04/16/nb-ns-sign-agreements-with-ontario-to-remove-trade-barriers,Jesse Thomas,positive
Rep. Wittman urges House to protect Medicaid for vulnerable groups | 13newsnow.com,"WASHINGTON, D.C., USA — Rep. Rob Wittman, R-Virginia, joined several congressional members in a letter urging U.S. House leadership to protect Medicaid coverage for vulnerable populations. The letter states that balancing the federal budget should not come at the expense of children, seniors, those with disabilities and pregnant women. “Our constituents are asking for changes to the healthcare system that will strengthen the healthcare workforce, offer low-income, working-class families expanded opportunities to save for medical expenses, support rural and underserved communities, and help new mothers,"" the letter states. Last week, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a budget that seeks at least $1.5 trillion in cuts to federal programs and services. The budget still must pass through the Senate, and it's unclear what potential specific cuts will be. RELATED: Virginia physicians call on representatives to preserve Medicaid in national budget The letter states that Medicaid cuts would threaten the viability of hospitals and nursing homes. Healthcare providers in rural and underserved areas often rely heavily on Medicaid. ""Providers in these areas are especially at risk of closure, with many unable to recover. When hospitals close, it affects all constituents, regardless of healthcare coverage,"" the letter states. On Tuesday, the Committee to Protect Health Care held a call with three Virginia physicians who implored their representatives to ensure Medicaid is protected in the proposed budget. One of those state leaders is Rep. Wittman. Wittman's Tuesday statement read in part: ""No one has proposed or voted on cuts to Medicaid. Medicaid is an indispensable lifeline for our nation’s most vulnerable, including people with disabilities, seniors, and expectant mothers. That’s why we must act now to strengthen the program.""",2025-04-17T00:14:37.136+03:00,https://www.13newsnow.com/article/news/politics/national-politics/rep-wittman-medicaid-cuts-protecton-congress/291-2d0696c9-f0aa-4aed-86d0-2d22bc592988,Hannah Eason Amado,positive
﻿財眼看房/內房呈現止跌回穩新特徵\夏 磊,"圖：內地一線城市高品質新房韌性十足，優質新房項目持續熱銷。
　　2025年一季度，房地產市場呈現止跌回穩的積極態勢。隨着政策大力支持和居民住房需求的釋放，市場修復明顯，房地產市場出現新特徵。
　　其一，二手房交易活躍度顯著高於新房，成為市場回暖的主要動力。2025年1-3月，一線城市新房網簽面積同比上漲6%，北上深二手房網簽量同比上漲45%，北上深二手房成交佔比達64%。以上海為例，3月二手房日均成交達947套，較2024年12月的高點下降1%。相比之下，新房市場整體動能趨緩，上海3月新房日均成交相較2024年12月高點下降28%。二手房交易是居民置換鏈條中的重要一環，其率先回暖可帶動房地產市場整體復甦。二手房價格穩定，會改善購房者信心，推動整個房地產市場止跌回穩。
　　二手房銷售也存在分化。核心區次新房、有獨特教育資源、交通便利、租售比高的二手房價格相對穩定，去化周期短；而部分房齡較老的房源因居住品質較差、戶型功能缺陷等原因，去化周期較長。
　　其二，一線城市高品質新房韌性十足。一線城市中優質新房項目持續熱銷，如上海壹號院二批次2025年1月開盤，當日銷售66億元；北京海淀功德寺兩項目開盤成交超150億元。兩項目均為每平米均價超10萬的改善項目，憑藉不可複製的區位溢價、高品質的產品、核心資產抗通脹預期的金融避險屬性等優勢實現熱銷。高品質住宅更受購房者青睞。購房者從「有房住」轉向「住好房」，安全、舒適、綠色、智慧成為重點關注。
　　其三，市場出現聯動修復。新房成交回暖激活土拍，形成正向循環。隨着新房去化提速，開發商現金流將有所改善，補庫存需求隨之上升，核心地塊競拍熱度攀升。同時，地方政府也調整商品住宅用地供應結構，加大了優質地塊供應，疊加房企聚焦主流城市戰略，共同推動土拍結構性升溫。
　　今年以來，北上廣深等一線城市及杭州、成都等強二線城市房地產市場熱度較高，與之對應的土地市場熱度提升。2025年3月，北京、杭州土拍市場分別拍出住宅單價地王，溢價率達28%、115%。2025年一季度各地住宅用地土拍溢價率普遍回升，北京土拍平均溢價率提升至11%、上海和深圳分別為29%、70%，顯著高於2024年溢價水平，杭州、成都等房地產市場恢復較快的核心城市，土拍溢價率也提升明顯，分別達43%、27%，反映了房企對市場信心的增長。
　　其四，政策紅利仍在釋放。其中，放鬆限購起到關鍵作用。核心城市房地產市場表現優於其他地區，主要因為過去核心城市住房交易在限購上有嚴格的限制，其政策強度與執行力度、執行時間均遠超三四線城市。2024年9月26日中央政治局會議後，一線城市大幅放鬆限購限制，調控晚於三四線城市，故至今仍處於政策紅利期。2024年四季度一線城市新建商品住宅銷售面積環比增長45%。其中，廣州全面放開限購，深圳縮小限購區域，兩地新房銷售面積同比分別增長69%和124%，市場修復速度明顯快於其他城市。二手房市場，一線城市在限購放鬆後二手房成交量持續處於高位，2025年春節後北上深二手房成交量相較去年同期恢復更迅速，市場熱度持續性強。
　　本輪市場復甦是需求主導的結構性修復，市場仍需政策持續呵護。房產是居民資產重要組成部分，關係老百姓切身利益。穩住樓市，有助於穩定預期、激發活力，推動經濟持續回升向好。同時房地產市場是內需的重要組成部分，在當前複雜的國際貿易形勢下，穩定房地產市場對於緩解外部衝擊，增強經濟的內生動力和韌性，有着不可忽視的積極作用。
　　穩樓市仍有加碼空間
　　未來政策空間，一是可以進一步地因城施策調減限制性措施，如一線城市擴大非限購區域、縮短社保或個稅繳納年限。二是可考慮取消二手房交易中的個人所得稅。目前，一線城市出售滿五不唯一的二手房時，需繳納出售計稅價格與房產原值、轉讓過程繳納的稅金差額的20%，或者按出售計稅價格的1%繳納個人所得稅。這一政策限制了部分改善性需求的釋放。取消個人所得稅將放寬置換的挑選時間，降低交易成本，為居民置換住房提供有力支持，從而進一步促進房地產市場的良性發展。

"Common man's voice must reach, and be heard by courts: Justice Arun Palli - The Tribune","Common man's voice must reach, and be heard by courts: Justice Arun Palli
“The voice of the common man must reach, and be heard by the courts,” said Chief Justice Arun Palli, as he was sworn in as the Chief Justice of the Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh High Court on Wednesday. He was administered the oath of office by Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha.
Setting the tone for a tenure anchored in accessibility, empathy and institutional reform, Justice Palli said it is imperative to accord equal space and attention to those who lacked the means or the legal vocabulary to press their case, in a system where seasoned litigants often came equipped with legal counsel and resources.
“It is essential to ensure that justice does not merely respond to the loudest voices, but to the most unheard,” Justice Palli said, affirming that the judiciary must reflect the constitutional commitment to equality in both letter and spirit.
As Chief Justice Palli spoke, it became apparent that access to justice for him is not a technical provision but a lived principle — one that requires active and continuous effort. He asserted that the institution must create conditions where even the humblest citizen walks into a courtroom with the faith that their concerns will receive a fair hearing. “Justice must be a right for all, not a privilege for a few,” he observed.
An equally strong focus of his vision is the grooming of young advocates. The Chief Justice expressed deep conviction that the future of the institution rests on the shoulders of the next generation of lawyers. “Young advocates are the future of the judiciary. They need to be mentored, guided and given space to grow — so that when time comes, they are prepared to carry forward the values and responsibilities of the profession,” he said.
He added that professional growth must be balanced with the development of ethical strength and a deep understanding of justice as a service to society. He also placed considerable emphasis on strengthening the subordinate judiciary, which he refers to as the backbone of the judicial structure.
Timely justice, particularly at the trial court level, Justice Palli said, is essential for sustaining public confidence.
“Delays at the grassroots level have consequences far beyond the courtroom. They affect lives, livelihoods, and most importantly, trust in the system,” he said.
He spoke with equal concern for vulnerable categories of litigants — including retired employees and widows — who often face an uphill task in securing relief in service and pension matters. “These are matters that directly impact the lives of people who are already at a stage where waiting becomes a burden. Their grievances must be resolved without delay,” he said, making it clear that compassionate efficiency will form the bedrock of his approach.
Justice Palli also referred to the need to revitalise the Legal Services Authority, calling it an essential tool for advancing the judiciary’s outreach mission.
He said that the institution’s success depended on the ability to extend legal aid to those who are otherwise left out of the formal justice system. “Legal aid is a constitutional right. Strengthening this mechanism is fundamental to ensuring that justice reaches every doorstep,” he said.
Infusion of technology into the functioning of the courts is also among his key priorities. He maintains that digital systems must be adopted not as a matter of convenience, but as a serious step toward systemic reform. “Optimum use of technology can help us tackle many longstanding challenges — from pendency to transparency. It must become part of the institution’s core functioning,” he asserted.
He also offered a roadmap rooted in constitutional vision, institutional discipline, and a forward-looking judicial temperament. ""The success of the justice delivery system stems not just from its decisions, but from its openness, its ability to listen, and its resolve to impart justice where it is needed most,"" Justice Palli concluded.",2025-04-17T00:48:00.000+03:00,https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/common-mans-voice-must-reach-and-be-heard-by-courts-justice-arun-palli,Saurabh Malik,positive

Liberty Energy Navigates Headwinds with Resilient Q1 Performance,"Liberty Energy Navigates Headwinds with Resilient Q1 Performance
Liberty Energy Inc. (formerly Liberty Oilfield Services, NYSE: LBRT) delivered a Q1 2025 earnings report that underscored its resilience in a challenging market, balancing sequential growth with lingering year-over-year declines. While macroeconomic uncertainties and industry headwinds persist, the company’s focus on technology-driven efficiency, strategic diversification, and disciplined capital allocation positions it as a potential outperformer in the oilfield services sector.
Financial Highlights: A Mixed but Improving Picture
Liberty reported $977 million in Q1 revenue, a 4% sequential increase from Q4 2024 but an 11% drop from Q1 2024. Despite the year-over-year decline, the results surpassed analyst expectations, with adjusted earnings of $0.04 per share beating the consensus estimate of $0.03. Sequential improvements in adjusted EBITDA—up 8% to $168 million—highlighted operational efficiencies, though margins remain pressured by lingering industry softness.
Net income of $20 million ($0.12 per share) reflected ongoing cost discipline, even as debt under its ABL Facility rose to $210 million. The company maintained its shareholder-friendly approach, returning $37 million via $24 million in share repurchases and $13 million in dividends. Since July 2022, Liberty has retired 15.9% of its outstanding shares, with $270 million remaining under its buyback program.
Operational Strengths: Technology and Market Share Gains
The quarter’s standout performance stemmed from fleet utilization improvements, which defied typical Q1 seasonal weakness. A “flight to quality” trend among producers—prioritizing reliable service providers—allowed Liberty to gain market share. Management emphasized technology advancements as a key differentiator:
- digiPrime natural gas variable speed pump: Reduced emissions while maintaining performance.
- AI-driven predictive maintenance: Extended equipment lifespan and lowered ownership costs.
- Fleet modernization: Enhanced real-time data tools improved operational decision-making.
The acquisition of IMG Energy Solutions further diversified Liberty’s revenue streams, expanding into distributed power systems for non-oilfield sectors like data centers. This move aligns with the company’s strategy to mitigate cyclicality risks and capitalize on industrial electrification trends.
Strategic Positioning Amid Industry Challenges
CEO Ron Gusek framed Liberty’s performance as evidence of its “fortress balance sheet” and operational resilience. With $24 million in cash and $164 million in total liquidity, the company remains financially flexible to weather macroeconomic volatility.
Guidance for Q2 2025 points to sequential revenue and profitability growth, driven by higher utilization and cost controls. However, risks persist, including geopolitical tensions, OPEC+ production dynamics, and potential tariff impacts. Liberty’s proactive measures—such as supply chain vertical integration—aim to mitigate these challenges.
Conclusion: A Steady Hand in Unsteady Markets
Liberty Energy’s Q1 results demonstrate its ability to navigate a cyclical industry through innovation and strategic foresight. While YoY declines reflect broader sector pressures, sequential growth in revenue, EBITDA, and utilization signals a stabilization trajectory. The company’s 12% trailing twelve-month adjusted pre-tax ROCE, though subdued, underscores its operational discipline.
Crucially, Liberty’s $270 million remaining buyback capacity and dividend policy—bolstered by a 15.9% reduction in shares outstanding since 2022—suggest continued shareholder value creation. The IMG acquisition and tech investments position the firm to capitalize on secular trends beyond oilfield services, further insulating it from commodity price swings.
Investors should monitor Liberty’s ability to sustain utilization gains and execute on its power services expansion. With a balanced sheet and a playbook for outperforming peers in downturns, Liberty Energy appears well-equipped to deliver long-term returns, even as macro risks linger.
In summary, Liberty Energy’s Q1 snapshot paints a picture of a company leveraging technology and diversification to stay ahead of industry headwinds. For investors seeking exposure to a financially disciplined oilfield services leader, this quarter’s results reinforce its case as a strategic holding.",2025-04-17T01:00:19.956+03:00,https://www.ainvest.com/news/liberty-energy-navigates-headwinds-resilient-q1-performance-2504,Nathaniel Stone,positive

Threat of Trump's tariffs sparks Colorado car sales boost - for now,"The start of the year is typically slow for car sales in Colorado.
It’s cold. Icy. And people are busy traveling to the mountains.
But so far this year, a surge of people bought cars as President Donald Trump placed tariffs on imports and foreign automakers and as Republican lawmakers threatened to cut federal electric vehicle tax credits.
New vehicle registrations in Colorado jumped more than 10% from January through March compared to the same period last year, according to a new quarterly outlook report from the Colorado Automobile Dealers Association.
State registrations were above the national average of 4.2% for the first quarter of 2025, the report said.
As economic uncertainty is hitting consumers during a typically slow period, Colorado Automobile Dealers Association CEO Matthew Groves said he expected the market to “tank” a bit.
But the opposite happened.
“The threat of tariffs, rather than the tariffs themselves, actually turned out to be a huge boon,” Groves said.
Trump announced 25% tariffs on cars in March. The tariffs for completed cars took effect on April 3 and tariffs for auto parts have been set to start 30 days later.
The weekend before tariffs went into place in April, Groves said some dealerships saw business spike by 150% as customers were wanting to finalize their purchases before any price hikes kicked in, clearing out a lot of existing inventory.
The boon isn’t expected to last as tariffs have been implemented, yet there’s still a lot of uncertainty on whether Trump will add more taxes on more imports from foreign countries or walk back on his trade negotiations.
Trump told reporters earlier this week he’s considering temporarily halting his 25% tariffs on the auto industry and giving carmakers more time to move their productions to the U.S., though it’s not clear how long a pause would last.
The recent sales boost “kept us alive for a little while,” Groves said.
Colorado Auto Show kicks off during an uncertain time
The Colorado Auto Show at the Colorado Convention Center, the annual show hosted by the trade association showcasing vehicles from both domestic and foreign carmakers, will be in town between Thursday and Sunday.
It’ll feature major manufacturers such as Subaru, Nissan, Cadillac and Italian luxury brands like Ferrari expanded their booths this year.
But the show isn’t about making sales, rather showing off the newest models and answering questions in a lower pressure environment.
At Ford’s display at the auto show, they’re prepared for curious customers concerned about how tariffs are affecting car prices.
“That's a question that comes up at every auto show across the nation right now,” said Sean Sachdeva, Ford regional manager in the Denver region.
The U.S.-based car manufacturer will be promoting its “From America, For America” employee pricing promotion, selling cars to the general public at employee-discount costs until June.
While tariffs are sparking fears of inflation, Ford is dropping its price tags — for now. But most of the cars it's selling from its inventory have already been manufactured before tariffs were placed.
“Business has been growing pretty significantly during the first quarter for Ford and especially here in the Denver region,” said Sachdeva.
“We're in a really good stock level right now across our dealer network to be able to meet the demand for the near future without having some of the pricing impacts that you're hearing elsewhere,” he added.
The Colorado Auto Outlook report forecasts if tariffs are scaled but are kept higher than in past years, then car prices may rise up to 5%. Sales in the state could drop to 218,000 units, which would be down nearly 2% from 2024.
If a trade war escalates, triggering a recession, the report said prices could surge to 10% this year, causing annual sales to drop nearly 8%.
For its more positive forecast in a scenario where tariffs would be mostly removed, the report said Colorado could see about 230,000 sales, up 4% from the year before.
""We continue to assess what potential impacts are but right now we've been able to contain it and that's been part of our commitment to our customers through June 2,"" Sachdeva at Ford said.
How much do Coloradans buy from foreign countries?
Colorado is uniquely positioned due to its high concentration of electric vehicles, many of which are made by U.S. carmakers such as General Motors and Tesla.
Still, car parts are shipped from all over the world and vehicles are almost never completely made within one country, Groves said.
“The domestic manufacturers have components from outside of the country and the foreign manufacturers have domestic components in manufacturing,” he explained.
American companies General Motors and Ford have both dropped their U.S. contents over the last decade from around 65% to 54%, according to the Made in America auto index. Meanwhile foreign companies like Nissan, Toyota and Volkswagen have been boosting their U.S. presence since 2015.
Honda used about 63% of components from the U.S. for its cars, outpacing GM and Ford.
More than 35% of the car market share in Colorado is domestic, according to the state’s auto dealer association. Nearly 12% are made by European brands. And more than half come from automakers based in Asia.
“You'll see a higher penetration of pickup trucks like Ford, Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep, Ram,” Groves said. “And because of the electric element, General Motors and Nissan [a Japanese carmaker with factories in Tennessee and Mississippi] are both doing very well.”
Colorado and California are the only two states where EVs make up at least 20% of the market share.
While EV sales soared, with some brands seeing increases of more than 100%, Tesla lost market share, attributing it to the rise of Tesla CEO’s Elon Musk in politics and an “aging product lineup,” according to the report.
Tesla’s share of the EV market in Colorado fell from 36% last year to 22% this year.
There’s been a violent backlash on Tesla cars, showrooms and charging stations since Musk became an advisor to Trump and has led efforts to cut federal spending and firing thousands of government employees with the Department of Government Efficiency.
In Colorado, there’s been a string of attacks on Tesla in Loveland involving Molotov cocktails hitting Tesla cars and the words “Nazi cars” spray-painted on a dealership building. In Lakewood, a suspect allegedly carved a swastika on a Tesla Cybertruck parked outside the Colorado Mills mall.
Meanwhile, state car registrations for the fully-electric Nissan Leaf manufactured in Mississippi surged nearly 468% within a year.
Nissan overtook Tesla as the top EV car seller in Colorado quickly.
In the first quarter of last year, Colorado saw more than 580 Nissan registrations. So far in 2025, Nissan had more than 2,750 registrations and now has a quarter of the market share.
“One of the reasons that Nissan and Chevrolet are doing very well in the EV field is because they make American-made EVs that are a little bit smaller and more affordable,” Groves said.
And state and federal tax credits also helped boost sales, he added.",2025-04-17T00:52:00.000+03:00,https://denvergazette.com/news/business/colorado-auto-sales-tarrifs/article_d6a85f30-9af8-47df-b3cb-553ca6567b3c.html,Bernadette Berdychowski bernadette.berdychowski@denvergazette.com,positive

En medio de la oficialización del romance entre Jefferson Farfán y Xiomy Kanashiro, Ducelia Echevarría causó gran impacto al afirmar que mantiene conversaciones privadas con la 'Foquita'.
Ducelia Echevarría, la popular exchica reality peruana, ha causado revuelo en las redes sociales y los medios de entretenimiento al revelar detalles personales sobre su relación con varios futbolistas, entre ellos, el renombrado Jefferson Farfán. En una reciente entrevista en el programa 'Café con la Chévez', Echevarría habló abiertamente de sus interacciones con jugadores de la selección peruana y desmintió ciertos rumores que giraban sobre ella. Lo que más sorprendió a los televidentes fue su declaración sobre la 'Foquita', a quien describió como un hombre ""respetuoso"", a pesar de las especulaciones sobre su relación con él.
La ex integrante de programas como 'Préndete' y 'Esto es guerra' no dudó en aclarar que, aunque ha tenido contacto con varios futbolistas, la relación con Jefferson Farfán es completamente profesional.

Ducelia Echevarría revela chats con Jefferson Farfán
Durante la conversación en 'Café con la Chévez', Ducelia Echevarría fue muy clara al hablar sobre su interacción con Jefferson Farfán, el famoso futbolista peruano. Aunque ambos mantienen una relación cordial y de respeto a través de las redes sociales, Echevarría desmintió cualquier tipo de interés romántico por parte del jugador. ""Farfán es muy respetuoso"", señaló Echevarría, quien destacó que ambos han hablado en varias ocasiones, pero únicamente por motivos laborales o de amistad.
""Nosotros sí hablamos a veces por redes sociales, por temas de trabajo"", comentó la ex chica reality. Sin embargo, añadió que nunca ha habido un acercamiento fuera de lo profesional. A pesar de la cercanía, Echevarría insistió en que Farfán nunca le ha mostrado ningún tipo de interés romántico, algo que, según ella, se ha malinterpretado varias veces en los medios.

NASHVILLE, Tenn. (WSMV) - The Tennessee General Assembly announced it has passed the state’s nearly $60 billion budget on Wednesday.
The House and Senate passed a $59.8 billion budget for the 2025-26 fiscal year.
The new spending plan shows a 2% growth rate with efforts to improve public safety, invest in infrastructure, advance education, and more, according to Republican legislators.
“The legislative amendment makes fiscally responsible adjustments to the administration’s initial budget proposal by shifting $19.94 million in recurring allocations to non-recurring, allowing the state to better manage long-term spending obligations,” Republicans said.

Rural Hospital Support and Healthcare Investments
Lawmakers used TennCare Shared Savings to provide an additional $78 million to help hospitals, particularly in rural areas, with uncompensated care and $4 million to complete capital projects at county health departments.
Additional healthcare investments include:
- $4 million recurring to increase pediatric dental rates
- $3 million nonrecurring to the Adult Healthcare Safety Net

- $500,000 nonrecurring to establish and operate the UT Law Enforcement Innovation Center
- $400,000 nonrecurring to support the East Tennessee Regional Forensic Facility and Training Program
Major investments secured
In addition to the adjustments made to fund legislative priorities, the budget maintains investments proposed by Gov. Lee including:
- $1 billion into the road fund to address the state’s transportation infrastructure needs
- $62.7 million for K-12 infrastructure and facilities funding
- $244 million to strengthen education through the Tennessee Investment in Student Achievement (TISA) formula growth, including teacher pay raises

- $25 million for FastTrack grants to recruit new business to Tennessee and support workforce development
Expanding choices for parents
The special session-passed school choice bill initiative invests $145.9 million in Education Freedom Scholarships.

"Habrá siete nuevas salas de oralidad y contarán con área para testigo protegido; agilizarán el desarrollo de juicios, señala presidenta del TSJE","A finales de mayo, los distritos judiciales de Sánchez Piedras y de Guridi y Alcocer contarán, con conjunto, con siete nuevas salas de oralidad, las cuales tendrán un área para testigo protegido, informó Anel Bañuelos Meneses, presidenta del Tribunal Superior de Justicia del Estado (TSJE).
Acentuó que este es un tema importante, ya que se trata de un proyecto que se esperaba concretar desde hace mucho tiempo porque este tipo de espacios “siempre hacen falta para agilizar los juicios orales” en la entidad tlaxcalteca.
Explicó que en este momento se prepara el proceso de entrega de las siete salas nuevas al Distrito Judicial de Guridi y Alcocer (ubicado en el municipio de Tlaxcala) y al de Sánchez Piedras (en Apizaco), a efecto de que sea concluido a finales del próximo mes de mayo.
La magistrada presidenta adelantó que cada una de estas instalaciones contará con un área para testigo protegido, lo cual es importante para el desarrollo de juicios en materia penal en el Sistema Acusatorio.
Enfatizó que con estas nuevas salas que se sumarán
a las que ya tiene el Poder Judicial, se amplía la infraestructura, y agregó que también se han equipado tecnológicamente las de los juzgados orales foráneos, desde el año pasado.
Asimismo, comentó que el gobierno del estado autorizó recientemente el proyecto de construcción de un complejo de 16 salas de oralidad, lo que permitirá la implementación del Código Nacional de Procedimientos Civiles y Familiares en el año 2027, para lo cual se debe preparar el Poder Judicial del estado.
“Estamos hablando de que ya tenemos un gran avance” en el tema de infraestructura con la cual se debe contar en la entidad para la impartición de justicia, indicó en entrevista colectiva la magistrada presidenta Anel Bañuelos Meneses.
Las salas de juicios orales son espacios donde se llevan a cabo procedimientos legales, con la finalidad de resolver disputas, presentar y evaluar pruebas, así como para tomar decisiones. Entre otras cosasa, deben contar con pantalla, videocámaras y micrófonos; un estrado y lugares para el público asistente.
A partir de la implementación de lo que se denominó Nuevo Sistema de Justicia Penal Acusatorio, el cual sustituyó al tradicional, se estableció que los juicios serán públicos, de ahí que las personas podrán presenciar el desarrollo de estos, pues se busca fomentar la transparencia en las actuaciones y decisiones que se tomen.
La sala contará con un lugar para la persona imputada, para el defensor, para la policía procesal, para la víctima y una para el asesor jurídico de esta; para el ministerio público, para testigos, para el tribunal de enjuiciamiento, para el auxiliar de sala y para medios de comunicación.
En el caso de aquellos espacios que tienen un área especial para testigos protegidos, el propósito es mantener en secreto la identidad de la persona, a efecto de resguardar su integridad. También cuentan con una cámara y un micrófono, así como con distorsionadores de voz e imagen, de ahí que es vital que sean equipados con la tecnología adecuada para dar certidumbre a quien se encuentra en esta calidad durante el desarrollo de un juicio.",2025-04-17T00:57:00.000+03:00,https://www.lajornadadeoriente.com.mx/tlaxcala/habra-siete-nuevas-salas-de-oralidad-y-contaran-con-area-para-testigo-protegido-agilizaran-el-desarrollo-de-juicios-senala-presidenta-del-tsje,Guadalupe de La Luz Degante,positive
Declan Rice says he 'knew' Arsenal would dethrone holders Real Madrid | Flashscore.co.uk,"Rice's two stunning free-kicks in the first leg set the Gunners on their way to dethroning the defending European champions.
The England international also won man of the match in the second leg as goals from Bukayo Saka and Gabriel Martinelli secured a famous win in Spain.
""It's such a special night for this club, it's a historic night for this club. We have an objective in this competition, we want to play the best teams and we want to win this competition,"" Rice told TNT Sports.
""There was a lot of talk coming here about them coming back because they've done it so many times before.
""But we had so much belief and confidence from that first leg that we could come here and win the game.
""We knew we were going to suffer but we knew we were going to win.""
Arsenal will face Paris Saint-Germain in their first Champions League semi-final since 2009.
The London club have never won European football's top prize and last won the Premier League back in 2003/04.
However, Rice, who joined from West Ham for a club record £105 million in 2023, believes major trophies are just around the corner for Mikel Arteta's men.
""It's massive. I sensed before I signed for the club that we were on an upwards trajectory,"" he added.
""This club is going to do special things in the coming years. We all fully believe in it, we have full trust in this manger - he's unbelievable!
""Semi-finals is massive for us and we want to take tonight in.""
Madrid rarely threatened to overturn their first leg deficit but Rice and Arsenal had to survive a scare after he was initially penalised for a foul on Kylian Mbappe inside the penalty area in the first half.
After a lengthy VAR check, the spot-kick was eventually ruled out and a yellow card that would have ruled Rice out of the first leg of the semi-final was rescinded.
""I knew it wasn't a penalty,"" said Rice. ""He just fell to the floor.""",2025-04-17T00:53:00.000+03:00,https://www.flashscore.co.uk/news/football-champions-league-declan-rice-says-he-knew-arsenal-would-dethrone-holders-real-madrid/AJLOULdB,AFP,positive

What Happened: Northern Oil and Gas reported estimated unrealized mark-to-market gains on derivatives of $9 million to $10 million for the first quarter. The unrealized gains were driven primarily by changes to the value of the company’s oil derivatives portfolio.
Northern Oil And Gas said realized hedge gains were an estimated $11 million to $12 million in the quarter, primarily driven by the company’s crude oil and Waha basis hedges.
Northern Oil and Gas noted it added “substantial” hedges since its fourth quarter report, including hedges to oil, natural gas and Waha, Midland-Cushing and M2 basis hedges.
The company also provided an update on shareholder returns. Northern Oil and Gas said it paid dividends of approximately $42 million during the first quarter. In February, the company declared a dividend of 45 cents per share, up 7% compared to the prior quarterly dividend. The dividend is payable on April 30.

"""The fire in him is good for Kumasi"" - John Darko backs Mayor's zeal","Suame Member of Parliament, John Darko, has weighed in on the recent controversies surrounding the new Mayor of Kumasi, expressing support for his ambition to clean up the city, but urging moderation in his approach.
Speaking on Channel One Newsroom on Wednesday, April 16, 2025, the MP commended the Mayor’s determination to restore order and cleanliness to the Ashanti regional capital.
“Our city is in need of help – he mentioned that he wants to clean the city of Otumfuo. And I agree with him that our city needs to be cleaned up,” Darko said, adding “I think that it was out of overzealousness. I think that he will be spoken to. I don’t know him personally and I haven’t seen him, but I think that the fire in him is good for Kumasi.”
The Mayor, whose aggressive campaign to clear unauthorized structures and street hawkers has sparked both praise and criticism, came under fire after reports emerged of his alleged threats of using excessive force including flogging to clear the pavements and roadside of recalcitrant hawkers.
While condemning any form of brutality, the Suame legislator stressed the importance of firm law enforcement guided by the Assembly’s regulations.
“Yes, maybe we should advise him—flogging people is not the way to go—but we should enforce the Local Government Act and the bye-laws of the Assembly and make sure that he is able to deliver on his mandate,” Darko stated.
He also called for a non-partisan approach to urban management, urging Ghanaians to support mayors in carrying out their duties without political interference.
“Let’s depoliticize these things and allow the mayors to work, and bring some sanity into our cities,” he added.
The comments come amid heightened public debate over the new Mayor’s leadership style, with some residents praising his decisiveness, while others raise concerns over human rights abuses.",2025-04-17T00:07:00.000+03:00,https://citinewsroom.com/2025/04/the-fire-in-him-is-good-for-kumasi-john-darko-backs-mayors-zeal,@citi973,positive

"MEIs representam 79,5% das empresas abertas no primeiro trimestre de 2025","O Rio Grande do Sul registrou um recorde de empresas abertas no primeiro trimestre do ano , registrando 84.505 novos empreendimentos. Delas, a grande maioria são formadas pelos microempreendedores individuais (MEIs): 67.212, que representam 79,5% do total . A categoria, criada em 2008, oferece benefícios e facilidades no registro, conquistando os pequenos empresários. Os dados foram compilados pela Secretaria Estadual de Desenvolvimento (Sedec) através da Junta Comercial, Industrial e Serviços do Rio Grande do Sul (JucisRS). De acordo com a presidente da JucisRS, Lauren Momback Mazardo, há um conjunto de questões que explicam o crescimento de MEIs no Rio Grande do Sul . Em especial, considera como fator decisivo o ambiente de negócios estabelecido por políticas públicas promovidas pelo governo estadual. Entre elas, a presidente da Junta Comercial ressalta o InvestRS, a agência de investimentos do Estado, lançada no final de 2024. “Hoje, a gente vê que o cenário está muito favorável, que as pessoas querem investir no estado do Rio Grande do Sul, que é bom viver aqui no nosso estado, que está bom para investir e tem muitas políticas públicas voltadas para o empreendedor, inclusive para os MEIs”, avalia Lauren. Já a analista de relacionamento responsável por MEIs do Sebrae-RS Giulia Mattos, reflete que o aumento das MEIs é um fenômeno nacional . “Não é uma novidade, mas uma tendência. É legal lembrar que nos últimos anos, os governos (federal, estadual e municipal) em parceria com outras instituições, inclusive com o Sebrae, tiraram do papel projetos muito importantes, como a nota fiscal eletrônica (NFS-e). E as MEIs vieram para ficar”, explica. A multiplicação das MEIs também tem como plano de fundo a Reforma Trabalhista , aprovada em 2017. A partir dela, passou a ser permitido que empresas terceirizem suas atividades principais, ampliando os contratos entre CNPJs. LEIA TAMBÉM: MEIs representam 79,5% das empresas abertas no primeiro trimestre de 2025 “Esse crescimento pode ser visto como um reflexo de um mercado de trabalho mais fragmentado e dinâmico. Na prática, o trabalhador assume o papel de empresário, incluindo em atividades que eram informais. E esse movimento nos fala tanto do espírito empreendedor quanto da necessidade de adaptação diante das transformações do mercado de trabalho”, pontua Giulia. A formalização de comércios, indústrias e serviços também é um dos fatores que explicam o aumento das MEIs . “Acho que as pessoas estão tendo mais acesso à informação, ao conhecimento, e estão se formalizando mais, seja através de sociedade limitada (LTDA), seja através do MEI. E o MEI, é claro, pela carga tributária ser menor, a tendência é ser a mais procurada para os pequenos negócios”, pontua. Entre os setores, foi o de prestação de serviços o que representou a maior parte do número total de abertura de novas empresas (73%), contra 19% de comércios e 8% de indústrias . De acordo com Giulia, é nele que se concentra a informalidade. E, nesse sentido, cita o ramo da logística como um segmento que pode ter contribuído para o crescimento na abertura de CNPJs. “De 2021 para cá a logística tem se destacado muito dentro da prestação de serviços. Principalmente, falando sobre a regulamentação da MEI caminhoneiro. Essa é uma legislação que tramitou no poder público por muito tempo e, finalmente, com a aprovação e regulamentação, trouxe uma parcela grande de motoristas autônomos de carga que viram vantagem nessa modalidade de empresa”, pontua a representante do Sebrae-RS.",2025-04-17T00:12:00.000+03:00,https://www.jornaldocomercio.com/economia/2025/04/1199248-meis-representam-795-das-empresas-abertas-no-primeiro-trimestre-de-2025.html,Ana Carolina Stobbe,positive

Bill mandating access to minors' social media messages advances to Senate floor,"Legislation aimed at safeguarding minors from online predators is heading to the Senate floor after clearing its last committee hurdle.
The Senate Rules Committee voted 21-0 for SB 868 , which would require social media companies to provide Florida law enforcement authorities with tools to decrypt encrypted messages if the user is underage.
Police and prosecutors would have to present the companies with a subpoena or warrant to gain access to messages. The bill would also require companies to grant a minor’s parent or legal guardian access to all the child’s accounts, and the platforms would be forbidden from allowing minors to use or access messages designed to disappear, like those on Snapchat and Instagram .
The bill, sponsored by Spring Hill Republican Sen. Blaise Ingoglia , faced opposition Wednesday from more than a dozen youths and tech advocacy groups like NetChoice and TechNet . Many contended that decryption would compromise the online security of all users, citing examples of governments and private companies being breached in recent years, including several in Florida .
GrayRobinson lobbyist Chris Carmody , representing Facebook parent Meta, said that when it comes to end-to-end encryption, it’s an all or nothing equation.
“If you create a key to unlock it, you’ve now unlocked everything or potentially unlocked everything,” he said. “The way this bill is drafted right now, that would do just that. It would create a backdoor.”
Ingoglia rejected that assertion as an “industry talking point” that social media giants are using to skirt what in every other situation would be a clear black-and-white issue. He also balked at claims that conforming to the bill’s dictates is too tall or expensive a task to be possible for them.
“We are now in an environment today where we’re talking about AI micro-nano-computers moving through the bloodstream of humans, being able to potentially detect cancer cells in people. That’s how advanced we’re getting,” Ingoglia said.
“They cannot tell me with a straight face that they cannot code something that can decrypt something on a one-time basis for the purpose of retrieving the evidence needed in court to put sexual predators away and then close the door right behind them.”
SB 868 would build on a law Gov. Ron DeSantis signed last year that prohibits children under 14 from having social media accounts and requires parental permission for 14- and 15-year-olds. It is one of the most stringent social media bans in the country and faces an ongoing legal challenge .
Ingoglia decided to file SB 868 after participating in state sting operations to catch online predators and seeing the disturbing activity firsthand. According to the U.S. Department of Justice, 1 in 5 children per year receive unwanted sexual solicitation online. One in 33 are targets of aggressive sexual solicitation , which involves pushes by the culprit to make offline contact. And at any given time, some 50,000 predators are on the internet actively seeking out children.
State Attorney Amira Fox of the 20th Judicial Circuit said it isn’t just some social media sites that are contributing to the problem; it’s all of them, it’s getting worse and the companies aren’t helping to fix it.
“This is attracting a lot of people who want end-to-end encryption for nefarious purposes, so when we issue a subpoena now … we get back, ‘We don’t have anything.’ They can’t report this anymore because they can’t see it. … This is incredibly dangerous.”
State Attorney Brian Haas of the 10th Judicial Circuit offered a similar perspective. But when asked by Senate Democratic Leader Jason Pizzo , a former Miami-Dade County prosecutor, to say which companies have been uncooperative, Haas declined to offer specifics.
“It’s more than I can name,” he said.
“Name one,” Pizzo retorted. Haas didn’t.
Pizzo also asked Ingoglia whether SB 868 would, in effect, mandate social media companies to acquire more physical space for servers on which the otherwise disappearing messages must be stored, and for how long. He noted that in cases of physical crimes like robbery and murder, CCTV footage prosecutors sometimes use is often on a loop that lasts for a finite timespan.
Ingoglia said it was a good question and would ask law enforcement officials and prosecutors whether there was a time limit that runs “concurrent with the statute of limitations on some of this stuff.”

Michelle Salzman of Escambia County and Tyler Sirois of Merritt Island has one more committee hurdle to surmount before reaching a full vote by the chamber.",2025-04-17T00:40:00.000+03:00,https://floridapolitics.com/archives/732782-bill-mandating-access-to-minors-social-media-messages-advances-to-senate-floor,Jesse Scheckner,positive

UCL: Arsenal Knock Out Trophy Holders Real Madrid To Reach Semifinals,"Arsenal are through to the semifinals of the UEFA Champions League (UCL), beating holders Real Madrid 5-1 on aggregate in their quarterfinal match to advance on Wednesday night.
The Gunners were too much for Real Madrid, as they secured a 2-1 win at the Santiago Bernabeu in their second match on Wednesday to reach the semifinals with a 5-1 aggregate win.
Wednesday’s quarterfinal burst into action after a pair of first-half penalty decisions. Bukayo Saka’s penalty was easily saved by Thibaut Courtois, while Madrid’s renewed optimism was dented minutes later after a penalty call of their own was overturned by the referee after a long VAR review.
Arsenal stymied Madrid’s attack in the second half before Saka made amends for his penalty miss with the game’s first goal. But a mistake by William Saliba immediately after led to Vinicius Junior scoring for the reigning European champions.
Gabriel Martinelli scored in injury time to cap off a memorable night for Arsenal and set up a date with Paris Saint-Germain in the team’s first semifinal appearance since 2009.",2025-04-17T00:30:00.000+03:00,https://leadership.ng/ucl-arsenal-knock-out-trophy-holders-real-madrid-to-reach-semifinals,Leadership News,positive
Deactur historical marker replaced after damage,"DECATUR, Ala. (WHNT) — A Decatur historical marker commemorating African American Heritage has been replaced after it was damaged last month.
The African American Heritage marker in Old Town Decatur has been replaced after it was damaged on March 24.
The marker chronicles the forgotten contributions of African Americans to the City of Decatur, going back to before the city was incorporated.
Established in 1821, Old Town was the home of many prominent African Americans and black-owned businesses before Urban Renewal took over in the 1970s. Decatur was incorporated in 1826.
A spokesperson for the Decatur Preservation originally said it would take a year to get a new marker and the replacement would likely cost thousands.
Historian Peggy Towns, who helped get the original marker placed, thanked Decatur Mayor Tab Bowling for helping get the marker quickly replaced.
The mayor told News 19’s Archie Snowden that he simply knew the right person to call for help.
“Nothing beats having reliable friends,” Bowling said. “When I learned about this unfortunate incident, I knew which friend to call.”
Decatur Police said last month they were investigating what caused the damage to the marker but had not determined if it had been damaged intentionally or accidentally.
Authorities said on Tuesday that there were no updates in that investigation.

ETF大爆走1／台股股災「這類型」成投資人新歡　它異軍突起挺進北美房市 | 財經 | CTWANT,"ETF大爆走1／台股股災「這類型」成投資人新歡 它異軍突起挺進北美房市
美國總統川普4月2日在白宮前展示簽署的「對等關稅」行政令，引爆全球股市股災。（圖／新華社）
川普四月發動世界級「關稅大戰」，中國全力反制，而CTWANT整理近二周「國外成分股ETF的成交量」排行榜發現，台股投資人新歡意外「換人」，多檔陸股港股為成分股ETF交易量超越美股ETF、台股ETF，不過本周大家回神後速速挺進高股息ETF；「在美國總統川普關稅政策變數中，不確定太高。」國泰投信董事長張錫接受CTWANT採訪時說。
CTWANT整理4月7日起至16日共八天「國外成分股」（跨國型、海外型）ETF成交量（不計入債券型、期貨型）前十名，由超過88.5萬張的00637L元大滬深300正2拔頭籌，其次依序為00665L富邦恒生國企正2、00753L中信中國50正2、00712復華富時不動產、00671R富邦NASDAQ反1、00882中信中國高股息、00650L復華香港正2、00830國泰費城半導體、00887永豐中國科技50大、00885富邦越南。
單看陸股、港股成分股的ETF來看，前十名中即占榜六名，美股成分股ETF則有三檔，越南股市一檔；而投資北美房市為主的00712復華富時不動產異軍突起拿下第四名。
CTWANT採訪國泰投信董事長張錫，他觀察這波股災中ETF成交爆大量，又以「高息型」台股ETF為大宗；此外，陸股、港股型又多於美股科技成分股的ETF，「對等關稅戰開打後，中國政府過去應對經驗多，且內需市場大，股市未如其他國家股市巨幅震盪，應是投資人青睞主要原因。」
中國信託投信基金經理人陳雯卿進一步解釋，今年以來驅動陸港股漲勢的力量主要有兩個，一是Deepseek問世引發陸港科技股的資產重估，去年下半年以來陸港科技股獲利好轉，且相較歐美科技股估值仍低，因此遇到不理性的回檔，反而是投資人中長線布局的機會。
另一個則是政策面驅動，中國政府積極透過「貨幣適度寬鬆」與財政政策發力，目的是穩定房市、股市與內需消費，而金融與內需消費正好是較不受關稅影響的產業，因此陸港股中包含科技、內需，金融與高股息等族群，仍是值得投資人關注的方向。
CTWANT整理中國今年初的「要實施好適度寬鬆的貨幣政策」，首要保持融資和貨幣總量合理增長，運用利率、存款準備金率等多種貨幣政策工具，保持流動性充裕等，這是自2011年後事隔14年再度施行；財政擴張政策上實施提振消費行動，加大消費品以舊換新，適當提高退休人員基本養老金、城鄉居民基礎養老金和基本醫療保險財政補助標準，推動全國性生育補貼，以及高科技製造業、新基礎建設和城市更新相關投資。市場預估，此一雙寬鬆救經濟政策，新增舉債上看70兆元新台幣。
中國信託越南機會基金經理人張晨瑋表示，美國現正與各國展開個別談判，若與越南關稅談判朝正向進展，勢必利於越股後市表現；越南基本面持續表現強勁，今年第一季經濟成長率6.93％，為2020年來最高增幅，受春節假期消費需求和國際遊客數量增加，服務業對GDP增長的貢獻率為53.7％；若美越雙方談判做出利於雙方的結論，越南關稅衝擊可望降低，或有機會重拾投資人青睞。
川普宣布對等關稅暫緩90天後，投資國外成分股ETF短中長期該如何布局？富邦投信投資策略師徐翊達表示，川普的對等關稅掀起全球股市大地震，股價上衝下洗，近期籌碼集中的AI 供應鏈呈現多殺多現象，波動異常大且超過雙位數，可觀察到美國S&P VIX恐慌指數4月8日最高來到52.33（正常約在10～20間，指數愈高或飆破40以上，即代表美股市場愈恐慌），近期雖有回落，但仍須關注流動性問題。
富邦投信投資策略師徐翊達表示，今年第一季因關稅政策的變數，引發投資人對美國經濟及聯準會貨幣政策的擔憂，市場避險情緒高漲，美股面臨強勁的賣壓而回落；時序第二季，在關稅政策逐漸明朗、美國企業獲利維持成長以及AI題材的發酵下，加上美股預估本益比隨著指數回落低於5年均值，美股投資機會浮現。
展望第二季，美股的首要關注焦點為企業在面臨關稅政策下的獲利表現和財測，後續持續留意川普放鬆監管和推動製造業回流對美國經濟的影響，長期而言美股相比其他非美市場的經濟和企業獲利動能前景更佳，美股作為長期的核心資產配置，當遇短期股市逆風而回檔時，建議可適度逢回加碼或定期定額。",2025-04-17T01:00:00.000+03:00,https://www.ctwant.com/article/410221,李蕙璇,positive

This segment of the expressway, which runs east of County Road 16A to just east of St. Johns Parkway through the Silverleaf neighborhood, is estimated to cost $242 million.
This segment of the First Coast Expressway, which runs east of County Road 16A to just east of St. Johns Parkway through the Silverleaf neighborhood, is estimated to cost $242 million. (FDOT) Sara Pleasants from FDOT explained what residents can expect in the coming months.
“They will see some overpasses being built, with the piles for those, and then just new roadway construction, laying asphalt, curb and gutter, that kind of thing,” she said.
Just a short drive from a local Jersey Mike’s near Silver Leaf, some shoppers mentioned they have begun noticing the changes brought by the expressway.

Pleasants went on to explain long-term project plans.
“This is a multi-year project. They started last fall on this segment, and it’ll continue, likely until around 2030. Later this year, we expect to see construction start on that final segment, which will be east of County Road 2209, from St. Johns Parkway to I-95,” Pleasants added.
Despite the noise and disruption, Alvarez sees the value in what’s coming.
“Shearwater is wonderful. I often say it’s kind of like a 55-and-over community for young families,” she said, highlighting the appeal of her neighborhood.
Pleasants explained some of the louder noise of the pile driving should be done in the next couple of weeks.
As construction progresses, the First Coast Expressway promises to enhance connectivity and accessibility for residents, paving the way for future growth in the region.

Municipal administrators seeking legislated regulation for profession,"Breaking News, Sports, Manitoba, Canada The group representing municipal administrators is urging the province to create a regulatory body for the profession, warning of a ""critical human resource crunch"" as a chunk of the workforce prepares to retire.

"Howell, Michigan breaks ground on new social district - CBS Detroit","Local Community Howell, Michigan breaks ground on new social district By Elle Meyers April 16, 2025 / 5:57 PM EDT / CBS Detroit
Construction to begin on new social district in Howell, Michigan Construction to begin on new social district in Howell, Michigan 01:26 An empty lot won't be empty for long after the city of Howell, Michigan, broke ground Wednesday on its new social district in the downtown area.
The estimated $13 million project will feature an ice skating rink, pavilion and gathering space.
""It's, you know, the culmination of not just three years but many years of planning and advocacy,"" said Howell Mayor Bob Ellis.
Ellis said the hope is to provide residents and visitors with a space away from home, work, or school.
""What really makes a community is these third places besides home and work or school if you're younger-- and that really builds a cohesive community where people feel like they're part of something,"" said Ellis.
Charles Gleeson III with C.E. Gleeson Constructors said he feels that these types of projects are special.
""You're just dealing with the true residents of the city, the people that really get to go in and enjoy these with their families, and you kind of get to touch their hearts a little bit more than with a standard commercial project,"" Gleeson said.
The space isn't currently designated for alcohol consumption, but Howell's existing social district does border the new gathering space.
""It'll only take one council meeting to expand that,"" Ellis said.

Cal State LA hosts Future Forums discussion about rebuilding Los Angeles following January's wildfires | Cal State LA Newsroom,"Cal State LA hosted the latest Future Forums, entitled “Recovery, Rebuilding, Resilience and the Future of Infrastructure,” on Tuesday, April 15, at the Golden Eagle Ballroom. A panel of experts discussed the future of construction and infrastructure in Los Angeles in the wake of the devastating wildfires of January.
In her keynote address, President Berenecea Johnson Eanes outlined the role that Cal State LA and other universities could play in the rebuilding of Los Angeles.
“Higher education institutions are uniquely positioned at the nexus of research, talent development, civic responsibility, and innovation,” President Eanes said. “We are laboratories for the future. And we have a profound opportunity—indeed a responsibility—to lead in the design, deployment, and scaling of infrastructure that is smarter, greener, more equitable, and more resilient.
“At our institutions,” she continued, “we have an incredible opportunity to use our campuses as testbeds for the next generation of infrastructure. Our students, faculty, and partners can create solutions in real time, turning theory into practice with every project. Cal State LA’s dedication to community engagement and sustainable prosperity exemplifies the CSU’s mission to serve the public good. We are poised to lead the way in creating resilience and equitable solutions to today and tomorrow’s economic, ecological, and societal challenges.”
Future Forums are presented through a partnership between Cal State LA, the Los Angeles County Economic Development Corporation, and CSU Dominguez Hills. The forums position higher education institutions at the forefront of industry advancements, offering insights into how emerging developments shape regional economic growth.
Tuesday’s event, which drew an audience of about 100, explored how emerging technologies, new materials, and forward-thinking policies are transforming the construction industry as Southern California moves forward from the recent wildfires.
The panelists included Joss Tillard-Gates, director at Clark Construction Group; Michael H. Anderson, architect and principal at Anderson Barker; Gabrielle Bullock, principal at Perkins & Will; and Robert Sausedo, president and CEO of Community Build, Inc.
Parveen Chhetri, assistant professor in the Department of Earth Science and Geography at CSU Dominguez Hills, served as the moderator.
Key topics of discussion included smart and sustainable rebuilding, infrastructure resilience, the role of technology, equitable economic growth and investment, and rebuilding post-wildfires.
Tillard-Gates warned that the rebuilding will not be completed overnight.
“I don’t want to depress anyone in the room, but this is going to take a lot of time, and people should be aware and clear-eyed about that,” he said. “The opportunity is that we can build in a really resilient way.”
Many of the homes that burned down in Altadena and the Palisades areas were wooden structures that were constructed from the 1930s through the 1950s. Sausedo said the areas were considered model communities, but they will not stand up to modern-day challenges, including climate change.
“Both communities involved in the fires were model communities,” said Sausedo. “What they did not have was model infrastructure. The infrastructure built for them was appropriate for that time.”
The panelists proposed a number of solutions, including using fire-resistant materials, building concrete-based structures, and burying power lines underground.
They also touched on additional challenges, such as the lack of construction workers living in an area where thousands of homes need to be restored. Los Angeles’ rebuild might have to depend partly on contractors from other parts of California or even other states.
Bullock spoke about the cultural challenges tied to the rebuild efforts, especially in Altadena, with its long history of providing opportunities to Black families.
“Whatever materials are used to make the homes more fire-resistant, the character of the neighborhoods, what the residents want must be what we lead with,” she said. “If we don’t engage the homeowners and the commercial owners in developing an approach to rebuilding—the design, the esthetics—then it’s not going to be right for them.”

Declan Rice reflects on 'special night' as Arsenal defeat Real Madrid to advance in Champions League | DAZN News US,"Declan Rice reflects on 'special night' as Arsenal defeat Real Madrid to advance in Champions League
There would be no Remontada for Real Madrid on Wednesday as they fell 2-1 to visiting Arsenal in the second leg of their Champions League quarter-final tie, giving the Premier League side a 5-1 aggregate victory after their three-goal victory last week.
It was a deserved victory for the Gunners, who once again showed no fear of the Spanish giants and were full value for the result, with goals by Bukayo Saka and Gabriel Martinelli sealing the London side's place in the semi-finals.
For first leg hero Declan Rice, who was immense again on Wednesday, winning at the Santiago Bernabeu was just deserts for the club as they continue on towards their goal of claiming their first Champions League title.
""It is such a special night for this club, a historic night for this club,"" Rice told TNT Sports. ""We had an objective in this competition - we want to win this competition.
""We had so much belief and confidence that we had enough to come here and win the game.
""We had it in our mind and we have done it in real life. What a night for the club.""
Amid another campaign in which the Gunners appear headed for a second-place finish in the Premier League — which would be their third runners-up finish in three years — the potential of reaching the top of the mountain in Europe's most glamourous competition is something worth striving for, Rice said.
""It is massive,"" he added. ""I sensed it before I turned up to the club that we were on an upward trajectory.
""In this competition, we have done amazingly well. We fully believe it and we have full trust in the manager - he is unbelievable.
""Semi-final, it is massive for us and we want to take tonight in.""

Florida lawmakers OK bill requiring fentanyl testing in hospitals. How measure fights overdoses,"TALLAHASSEE, Fla. – A bill to require hospitals to test some patients for the presence of fentanyl in their systems passed the Florida Legislature and is now headed to the governor for his signature.
HB 1195 passed unanimously in the Florida Senate and House on Wednesday.
Recommended Videos
The bill, also known as “Gage’s Law,” would require hospitals and hospital-based emergency facilities treating patients for a suspected drug overdose or poisoning to test them for fentanyl as well via a urine test.
[2025 ANNUAL SESSION: See what new bills Florida lawmakers are working on ]
The bill is named for Gage Austin Taylor, who died of an overdose in 2022 at the age of 29.
Taylor’s mother, Gretchen Murray, fought for the bill. She said her son took a drug he didn’t know was laced with fentanyl, and the hospital didn’t test for the drug.
That led to an error on the medical examiner’s autopsy report, and as a result, law enforcement was not able to charge Taylor’s suspected drug dealers with homicide initially. After an investigation, the medical examiner changed the report, and law enforcement was able to bring charges.
Murray brought the bill to the Orange County Legislative Delegation. State Reps. Rita Harris, D-Orlando, and Doug Bankson, R-Apopka, partnered on the bill in the Florida House.
Harris said the bill is important because of the rise of people taking drugs and not realizing they are laced with fentanyl.
A legislative staff analysis says that from January 2023 to June 2023, 2,541 people in Florida died because of fentanyl, and of those deaths, 94.3% were accidental.
The analysis also cited a report by Epic Research that said only 14% of hospital emergency departments tested for fentanyl, as of June 2023.
“It’s a bipartisan issue that’s impacting all of Florida, no matter if you’re in a rural area or if you’re in a city,” Harris told News 6 back in February. “You hear these stories and they’re heartbreaking.”
Harris said it is also important for a hospital to know if a patient has fentanyl in their system so they know what medicinal treatments they can safely give them.
Should DeSantis sign the bill, it would go into effect on July 1, 2025.

"上市券商一季度或迎""超预期开局"" 头部券商稳健领航、中小券商""弹性十足""","近期，上市券商一季度业绩轮廓逐渐明晰，密集披露的业绩预增公告揭示了多家公司归母净利润显著增长的态势，凸显出资本市场回暖背景下券商板块的业绩弹性。其中，综合实力雄厚的头部公司持续领跑，中小券商则展现出“弹性十足”的业绩表现。
　　基于目前已披露的业绩预增情况，分析师普遍对上市券商一季度业绩持乐观态度，认为券商整体业绩有望超预期。开源证券非银金融行业首席研究员高超表示：“上市券商一季度业绩增速整体超预期，预计一季度交易量高增长、投资收益低基数是主要驱动力。”
　　 业绩弹性足
　　截至4月16日记者发稿，共有9家上市券商发布了一季度业绩预增公告，均预计净利润实现较大幅度增长。
　　从头部券商来看，券商“新巨头”国泰海通预计一季度实现归属于母公司所有者的净利润112.01亿元至124.45亿元，同比增长350%至400%。中信证券预计一季度实现归属于母公司股东的净利润约65.45亿元，同比增长32%左右。华泰证券预计一季度实现归属于母公司所有者的净利润34.37亿元至36.66亿元，同比增长50%至60%。
　　同时， 中国银河 （ 601881 ）预计一季度实现归属于母公司股东的净利润27.73亿元至31亿元，同比增长70%至90%。 中金公司 （ 601995 ）预计一季度实现归属于母公司股东的净利润为18.58亿元至21.06亿元，同比增长50%至70%。 中信建投 （ 601066 ）预计一季度实现归属于母公司股东的净利润约18.43亿元，同比增长50%左右。
　　中小券商业绩表现则“弹性十足”。其中，东北证券预计一季度实现营业收入14.85亿元，较上年同期增长25.94%；实现归属于上市公司股东的净利润2.02亿元，较上年同期增长859.84%。 华安证券 （ 600909 ）预计一季度实现归属于上市公司股东的净利润为5.02亿元至5.58亿元，同比增长80%至100%。东吴证券预计一季度实现归属于母公司所有者的净利润9.12亿元至10.03亿元，同比增长100%至120%。
　　对于一季度上市券商业绩增长的原因，多家券商表示，主要得益于财富管理、投资交易等业务收入的增长。中信证券表示，一季度，公司锚定打造一流投资银行和投资机构的发展目标，积极服务实体经济，综合金融服务能力持续提升，财富管理、投资交易等业务收入同比增加较多。华泰证券表示，一季度，公司不断深化平台化、一体化与国际化运营，财富管理、机构服务、投资管理等主要业务线均同比显著增长。
　　国泰海通业绩实现大幅增长的原因，除了上述提及的财富管理、投资业务向好之外，还涉及公司之间的吸收合并交易。国泰海通表示，一季度，公司主动把握市场机遇，全面推进零售、机构和企业三大客户服务体系建设，推进各项业务稳步发展，取得较好经营业绩。同时，公司积极推进换股吸收合并海通证券相关工作，加速向国际一流投资银行迈进。一季度，公司归属于母公司所有者的净利润增长的主要原因为吸收合并海通证券产生负商誉。
　　“预计经纪与信用业务是上市券商一季度业绩增长的主要支撑，投资业务也同比改善。”国泰海通非银首席分析师刘欣琦预计，经纪及信用业务合计贡献增量收入的78.5%，是券商板块业绩增长的主要支撑。同时，预计投资业务同比有所改善。
　　 经纪、信用业务成“增长引擎”
　　回顾今年一季度市场走势，数据显示，一季度A股日均交易额1.52万亿元，同比增长70.27%。上交所数据显示，一季度A股新开户数量为747.14万户，同比增长32.75%。
　　“一季度上市券商业绩的增长，一方面受去年同期自营业务低基数效应影响，另一方面得益于一季度股票成交量同比高增带动经纪业务收入增长。”中信建投非银及金融科技首席分析师赵然表示，4月份以来，券商板块经历短暂回调后，性价比再度凸显，看好板块后续估值修复动能，核心逻辑在于业绩韧性筑牢安全边际，政策与宏观环境改善形成双重催化，板块估值具备向上空间。
　　针对上市券商一季度整体业绩，方正证券研究所所长助理、金融首席分析师许旖珊表示：“预计上市券商一季度主营收入同比增长33.1%，归母净利润同比增长77.7%；剔除国泰海通吸收合并的负商誉影响后，预计一季度券商板块归母净利润同比增长51%。分业务看，预计一季度经纪、信用业务为券商业绩增长的主要驱动力，经纪、投行、资管、净利息、净投资收入分别同比增长65.7%、27.8%、2.8%、77.1%、2.7%。”",2025-04-17T00:54:00.000+03:00,http://field.10jqka.com.cn/20250417/c667524222.shtml,证券日报,positive

振兴“足球之乡”，江阴“传球助攻”在路上
机器人迎接宾朋，青少年驰骋绿茵场，机器狗跳起啦啦操……近日，江阴首届青少年三大球运动会开幕。从江阴市文体广旅局获悉，今年的校园足球赛事规模创造新纪录——127支队伍共1572名运动员参赛，其中547名是英姿飒爽的女足小将，足球运动成为这个春天江阴校园最美的风景。
从元旦江阴队代表无锡出征苏州夺冠，到江阴小将刘诚宇亚洲杯单刀破门，再到全国女足超级联赛江苏主场赛事花落江阴，今年以来，江阴足球风光无限、战火再燃。江阴精神与体育精神一脉相承，被誉为“足球之乡”的江阴还有着和世界杯差不多长的足球历史，这座小城是如何把足球这一文化延续至今的呢？
“全民足球”让人人尽享“足瘾”
昨天下午，位于江阴城区中山南路的全民健身综合馆旁格外热闹。占地面积近7000平方米的足球场不时有吆喝声传来。“下午3点半到5点半，是业余体校的学员们训练时间，在这之前，这片球场多是被老年协会的老年足球爱好者给‘承包’了。”全民健身综合馆的孔海明介绍，每天前来踢球的老年人有近30人，除了刮风下雨，几乎天天在场。
足球场上的身影，自然少不了青年。到了晚上，江阴体育馆的笼式足球场最热闹。“一共有6片五人制的场地，晚上7点半到9点半基本爆满。”江阴体育馆馆长薛振新说，笼式足球场虽然场地不大，但灯光等各式设备一应俱全，最受企业青睐，“一周踢一次足球是不少长包企业的标配，11人制的大场足球难度系数高，笼式足球更适合上班族。”
运河边、企业里、校园内……江阴的足球场地随处可见，这为市民尽享“足瘾”提供了平台。此次全国女足超级联赛江苏主场赛事花落江阴，看中的正是江阴体育中心这片承接了多次国际足球赛事的足球场。“这是全国女足系列赛事中最高级别的职业赛事，全年11场均会在江阴体育中心举行。”江阴市文体广旅局竞赛科相关负责人介绍，中甲、中超等比赛也曾落地于此。
“体教融合”踢出了“江阴神话”
此次江苏无锡女足队中，有三名是来自江阴的“女将”。过去，江阴足球“女将”在足坛踢出了“江阴神话”。早年，16岁的翁新芝入选女足国家队，成为当时最年轻的国脚；2022年，吴澄舒抢点破门，助力中国女足夺得第二十届亚洲杯冠军。这些“女将”都来自江阴二中，从1999年建立女足队伍，该校是江阴最早推行“市队校办”训练模式的学校之一，如今已成为校园足球的一张名片。
男足的实力同样不容小觑。去年的四国邀请赛中，中国U19男足以一场振奋人心的2︰0战胜韩国队成功夺得冠军，江阴小将刘诚宇独中两元，成为本场比赛的英雄。近日，2025年中国足协青少年足球锦标赛会员协会男子U18组圆满收官，江苏足协U18捧得冠军奖杯，江阴运动员朱嘉熙以精彩的扑救让对手的进攻均无功而返，获得最佳守门员称号。
近年来，江阴一中、江阴二中在“省长杯”足球赛中多次夺冠，为省队、市队、俱乐部及高校输送了200多名优秀足球人才。“从翁新芝、吴澄舒到刘诚宇接连走上更高舞台可以看到，江阴体教融合模式结出了累累硕果。”江阴市业余体育学校校长姜屹峰说，就拿2020年南京体育学院招录的足球特长生来说，江阴足球人才占了四分之一。
振兴“足球之乡”还需再添一把火
都知道足球要从娃娃抓起，但“招生难”现象普遍存在。“很多人对体育生还存在着老看法，很多家长也不愿孩子从事体育行业。”姜屹峰说，在校的近百名足球生平均分布在小学、初中、高中各学段，高中学段的一级运动员占比达80%以上，“体育精神讲究的是更高更快更强，吃苦不可避免，我们也在探索不同的集中培养模式，让学生不脱离家庭关爱也能敢于吃苦。”
从2015年成为全国校园足球试点城市至今，江阴已有72所足球特色学校，每年举办超过300场校园足球联赛。“以江阴一中、江阴二中等特色强校为龙头校，以高中来带动初中、小学共同推进三大球的课程建设和教育教学。”江阴市教育局负责人介绍，江阴还构建了周周有比赛、班班有队伍的赛事体系，齐力推进全市域中小学三大球运动。
“与河海大学签约共建优质生源基地、共建实训基地，打造小学、中学、大学相互衔接的一条龙升学体系，这为江阴足球人才畅通了成长通道。”江阴市文体广旅局负责人介绍，河海大学足球队在大学生足球圈中有着不凡的实力和地位，未来从基地培养出来的运动员达到一定要求就能直升“双一流”大学，这对江阴振兴“足球文化”而言意义非凡。

El Tribunal Supremo pone fin al litigio de Casteleiro y le devuelve la propiedad del Porsche,"El Tribunal Supremo pone fin al litigio de Casteleiro y le devuelve la propiedad del Porsche
El exconcejal y expresidente del PP de San Bartolomé pleitea desde el año 2012 por la titularidad del coche con un comerciante de Arguineguín
El Tribunal Supremo ha rechazado los recursos contra la sentencia de la Audiencia Provincial de Las Palmas que otorgó la propiedad del coche marca Porsche 911 Carrera a Ignacio Casteleiro Cullen, exconcejal y exlíder de Partido Popular (PP) en San Bartolomé de Tirajana, lo que pone punto y final a un litigio de más de 12 años por la posesión del vehículo con el comerciante y vecino de Arguineguín Antonio Heredia, al que los juzgados de primera instancia habían dado la titularidad del deportivo tras los desacuerdos sobre el contrato de compraventa por 18.000 euros.
Una providencia dictada el pasado 2 de abril por la Sala de lo Civil del alto tribunal inadmite el recurso de casación, y otro extraordinario por infracción procesal, que interpusieron los representantes legales de Heredia contra la sentencia emitida en diciembre de 2022 por la Audiencia Provincial.
Esa resolución judicial revocó una anterior sentencia del Juzgado de Primera Instancia Número 1 de San Bartolomé de Tirajana, que obligaba a Casteleiro a entregar el Porsche, y anuló el acuerdo de compraventa que había dado la propiedad del vehículo a Heredia.
El litigio se remonta al año 2012 y tuvo amplia repercusión porque en esa etapa Casteleiro era concejal de Seguridad Ciudadana y Disciplina Urbanística en el Ayuntamiento de San Bartolomé y presidente del PP en ese municipio. A principios de 2013 dimitió de su cargo en el gobierno municipal al verse salpicado por denuncias sobre permisos en el ocio nocturno.
El pleito se inició en septiembre de 2012, cuando Casteleiro denunció a Heredia, antiguo cliente de su bufete de abogados, por una presunta falsificación de la documentación del Porsche. Heredia fue detenido en el mercadillo ambulante de Puerto Rico al día siguiente y retenido en la comisaría de Maspalomas hasta que su familia entregó una documentación de la Dirección General de Tráfico (DGT) en la que el vehículo figuraba a su nombre.
La denuncia penal de Casteleiro recayó en el Juzgado de Instrucción Número 3 de San Bartolomé, que tomó declaración como imputado a Heredia a principios de 2013, entre cruce de acusaciones entre ambos de ser la víctima de una estafa. El caso se juzgó en la Audiencia Provincial en 2016 y la Fiscalía pidió tres años de prisión para el comerciante.
Absolución
La Audiencia Provincial, en el mes de julio, absolvió a Heredia de los delitos de estafa y falsedad documental. Casteleiro recurrió la absolución ante el Tribunal Supremo, que en marzo de 2017 inadmitió el recurso.
No obstante, ni la Audiencia ni el Tribunal Supremo aclararon la titularidad del coche, por lo que el pleito se retomó por la vía civil. En febrero de 2019, el Juzgado de Primera Instancia Número 1 de San Bartolomé condenó a Casteleiro a entregar el Porsche a Heredia y a indemnizarle con la cantidad que resulte de la diferencia entre el precio de compra abonado, 18.000 euros, y el valor del vehículo en aquel momento.
El exconcejal recurrió entonces a la Audiencia Provincial, que estimó la apelación y revocó al anterior sentencia, que ahora confirma el Tribunal Supremo. Entre otros argumentos jurídicos, los tres magistrados de la Sección Tercera de la Audiencia señalaron en su sentencia de 2022 que «no es discutido que el vehículo no se entregó, y tal hecho, como señala la sentencia deinstancia, no sería, en su caso razón para anular la compraventa, como tampoco lo sería la falta de pago del precio; sin embargo, es creíble la versión dada por el apelante que cuando firmó el contrato litigioso creía que estaba firmando la venta de otro vehículo (un Citroen)».
También relatan que «se contradice, el demandado, cuando alega que el dinero y la documentación delvehículo le fue entregado en la calle, frente al apartamento donde vive el actor, pues en su contestación a la demanda alegó que “… acordaron que la firma del contrato y demás documentos necesarios se realizara en el despacho del Sr. Casteleiro». Igualmente, según los magistrados, «no es creíble su manifestación de que en el momento del pago el actor le entregara los documentos ‘originales’ del vehículo para ser compulsados en Tráfico, pues si así hubiera sucedido tendría, entonces, los originales en su poder».
Heredia mostró ayer su decepción con estas dos últimas resoluciones judiciales, pues todas las anteriores por la vía penal le habían dado la razón.

U.S. Bancorp records first-quarter profit amid economic uncertainty,"U.S. Bancorp, the nation’s fifth-largest bank, posted first-quarter profits with solid returns on fees and net interest income as executives warned of broader uncertainty looming over global trade, consumer confidence and health of the national economy.
CEO Gunjan Kedia, who took the reins as chief executive on Tuesday, said during an analyst call Wednesday that the company remains confident in the face of looming uncertainty, reaffirming the bank’s target of between 3% and 5% growth for the full year.
The bank’s stock closed down 2% Wednesday, mirroring the decline in the S&P 500.
Kedia said U.S. Bank is committed to building a vibrant franchise around its payments business, which includes fees and net interest income for debit cards, stored-value cards, consumer and business credit cards, government and purchasing card services and merchant processing. On the loan side, Kedia said growth has benefited from competitive products attractive to borrowers.
She acknowledged “an environment of intense market and economic volatility,” but said the company’s consistent record on managing risk will continue to offer “a competitive advantage as we go forward.”
U.S. Bank reported $1.7 billion in net income on $6.96 billion in revenue for the first quarter of 2025, outpacing Wall Street estimates. Earnings per share arrived at $1.03, beating a 99-cent consensus estimate from analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research. The company recorded a gain of 78 cents per share during the same period in 2024.
Meantime, income generated through fees notched $2.4 billion, a 5% increase over 2024. Executives pointed to strength in its payments business, though identified some opportunities for improvement.
Big picture, Kedia said the company is coming off two years of heavy focus on its integration of California-based Union Bank into the Bancorp franchise and building back capital following the 2023 banking failures. U.S. Bank, alongside its industry peers, were hit with soaring deposit costs after the abrupt failures at Silicon Valley Bank and First Republic Bank in California.",2025-04-17T00:51:00.000+03:00,https://www.startribune.com/as-profits-rise-us-bancorp-remains-vigilant-for-looming-economic-uncertainty/601325805,Bill Lukitsch,positive
Ex-Agency Officials Praise Trump Bid to Add AI to Permit Process,"The Trump administration’s push to deploy modern technology in environmental permitting is being hailed as a smart move by former government officials on both sides of the aisle.
The positive reaction is a dramatic shift—congressional Democrats and environmentalists have generally opposed almost every other permitting tweak President Donald Trump has announced. Still, questions linger about which technology vendors will provide the solutions and whether documents produced with artificial intelligence (AI) will stand up in court.
Trump’s Tuesday memo directs federal agencies to make “maximum use” of technology in permitting, though it doesn’t mention any specific technology by name.

Patricia Bullrich incluyó a cuatro municipios mendocinos en un plan de emergencia para reducir los homicidios,"Patricia Bullrich incluyó a cuatro municipios mendocinos en un plan de emergencia para reducir los homicidios
El Ministerio de Seguridad iniciará el ""Plan 90/10"" con el objetivo de reducir los homicidios y violencia relacionada en 14 comunas del país, distribuidas en cuatro provincias.
El Ministerio de Seguridad de la Nación, que conduce Patricia Bullrich, aprobó este miércoles una resolución con la cual comenzará a aplicar el llamado ""Plan 90/10"", que tiene como objetivo reducir los homicidios en departamentos ""más críticos"" a nivel país.
Mendoza no es ajena a esto. De hecho, está dentro del lote de las cuatro provincias donde se aplicará este ""Plan Territorial de reducción de Homicidios y Violencia Relacionada"", junto a Santa Fe, Buenos Aires y Córdoba.
Municipios ""calientes""
En total, son 14 departamentos ""calientes"" donde se llevarán a cabo las maniobras de seguridad. De la provincia, están nombradas la , , y Guaymallén.
Además, aparecen de Santa Fe, la ciudad de Rosario (Rosario y Villa Gobernador Gálvez), más Santa Fe Capital; de Tucumán, San Miguel de Tucumán; de Córdoba, la Capital y Gran Córdoba; y de Buenos Aires, están incluidas Esteban Echeverría, General Pueyrredón, General San Martín y Tres de Febrero.
Según informó la Nación, el Plan 90/10 tiene ese nombre ya que focalizará la intervención del Estado ""en el 10% de los municipios del país"" mediante estrategias de ""prevención, control del delito y fortalecimiento institucional"". Estos territorios ""concentran el 70% de la población nacional y el 90% de los homicidios intencionales"".
No obstante, en los anexos de la resolución se determinó que las 14 jurisdicciones ""priorizadas"" para las medidas de prevención del delito ""tienen sólo el 15% de la población total del país, y en ellas se cometen 1 de cada 3 homicidios intencionales"".
En la resolución 448/25, se estableció que el Ministerio de Seguridad Nacional ""coordinará las acciones de los Cuerpos Policiales y las Fuerzas Policiales y de Seguridad Federales, las que podrá delegar en el funcionario que designe a tal efecto"".
También se ""invitó"" a las jurisdicciones provinciales ""a adherir a los alcances establecidos por la presente Resolución"", que no implicará ningún tipo de erogaciones presupuestarias.
Narcomenudeo y lavado de dinero
Desde el Gobierno, la ministra de Seguridad, Mercedes Rus, ha valorado el plan nacional, y solicitó que se aplique para los casos de investigaciones y operativos en conjunto con la Justicia Federal relativo a los delitos de narcomenudeo (estupefacientes) y también lavado de activos.
""Para nosotros es muy importante reforzar las investigaciones profundas en eso"", marcó.
En este sentido, agregó vendrá a Mendoza ""una dotación de Policía Federal para que atienda las investigaciones profusas que nosotros queremos tener en materia de estos delitos federales"".
""Desde octubre del año pasado, venimos trabajando muy bien todas las fuerzas en los operativos. El primer operativo conjunto fue el del barrio Santa Teresita. El 90/10 lo vamos a aplicar con esta lógica y con esta perspectiva, que es la que hemos pedido, que es la que entendemos que es importante para la estrategia de seguridad de la provincia"".
Datos de homicidios
Para la cartera de Bullrich, si bien en términos generales la tasa de homicidios ""se mantiene en niveles moderados"" comparados con países de la región, ""persisten focos críticos en ciertas áreas urbanas y territorios con alta marginalidad social"".
En términos de homicidios, la Ciudad de Mendoza tuvo en 2023 una tasa de 5,8 homicidios cada 100.000 habitantes. Luego aparece Godoy Cruz, con una tasa de 5,3 homicidios; Las Heras, con 5,3; y Guaymallén, con 3,2 cada 100.000 habitantes.
De igual forma, estos valores son sensiblemente menores a las ciudades santafesinas; y también se ha registrado una baja progresiva -salvo algunos repuntes- con el paso de los años.
Quizás el ejemplo más claro es el de la Ciudad de Mendoza, que pasó de una tasa de 20,2 homicidios cada 100.000 habitantes en 2014, a 5,8.
En tanto, no está de más poner la lupa en Godoy Cruz, que si bien también hace una década tenía una tasa de 14,5 homicidios, supo tener en 2022 una tasa del 1,9, pero ese número rebotó al 5,3.
Por otro lado, en lo que corresponde a la tasa de homicidios dolosos, también en 2023, aparecen los siguientes datos respecto a Mendoza. En la Ciudad de Mendoza hubo 7 víctimas, lo que dio una tasa de 5,8; en Godoy Cruz hubo 10 víctimas y una tasa de 4,8; en Guaymallén, 11 víctimas en todo el 2023, con una tasa del 3,2; y finalmente Las Heras, con 13 homicidios y una tasa del 5,3.
""La priorización de territorios a intervenir se realizó a partir de un diagnóstico centrado en una serie de indicadores de actividad criminal, sociodemográficos y otros de relevancia estratégica. En ciertos casos, el listado de municipios priorizados fue completado con otros municipios colindantes por integrar conglomerados urbanos que no pueden ser disociados desde el punto de vista de la estrategia de prevención"", destacó la Nación.
El plan de trabajo de seguridad en las comunas
Desde el ministerio que conduce Bullrich se plantea ""la desarticulacion redes delictivas y estructuras criminales que promueven la violencia letal; el fortalecimiento de las capacidades de las Fuerzas Policiales y de Seguridad Federales, y del sistema de justicia, para aumentar el esclarecimiento y la sanción de los homicidios; así como también la disminución de la circulación y el uso ilegal de armas de fuego"".
Otro de los objetivos es ""recuperar el control territorial en zonas de alta conflictividad donde el Estado ha perdido presencia frente a actores violentos"".
El Ministerio aseguró que la ""experiencia internacional y la evidencia basada en estudios de criminología"" sugieren que las políticas públicas en la reducción de homicidios contienen algunos planes que se aplicarán a partir de la implementación de este programa, con las siguientes actuaciones:
- Intervenciones focalizadas en territorios críticos.
- Coordinación entre niveles de gobierno y Fuerzas Policiales y de Seguridad Federales. - Un análisis profundo de los factores de riesgo, tanto individuales como estructurales.
- Focalización en el crimen organizado y la violencia armada.
- Control del acceso a armas de fuego.
- Incluir una combinación de estrategias preventivas y punitivas que involucren tanto a las Fuerzas Policiales y de Seguridad Federales como a la comunidad.
""Este Plan se erige como una respuesta integral, basada en evidencia para reducir no solo las tasas de homicidios intencionales, sino también los factores asociados a la violencia en los territorios más afectados, sin dejar de atender demandas específicas de inclusión realizadas por los gobernadores provinciales a partir de evidencia empírica que surgen de fuentes de datos provinciales"", acotaron.",2025-04-17T00:49:00.000+03:00,https://mdzol.com/politica/2025/4/16/patricia-bullrich-incluyo-cuatro-municipios-mendocinos-en-un-plan-de-emergencia-para-reducir-los-homicidios-1202742.html,mdzol.com,positive

Histórica incautación en el Valle del Elqui: más de 9.000 plantas de marihuana y tres detenidos
Fueron más de 45 mil millones de pesos en droga intervenida a sobre 3500 metros de altura. La mayor incautación en la historia para Carabineros en el Valle del Elqui, desglosada en casi 9400 plantas de hasta dos metros de alto, más de 134 kilos de droga procesada, municiones, armamento y tres detenidos fue el resultado del trabajo investigativo en terreno encabezado por los carabineros especializados del OS7 Coquimbo en la comuna de Vicuña.
La intervención rural se extendió por más de doce horas y consideró un equipo multidisciplinario por parte de la policía uniformada, que desplegó diversos recursos tecnológicos, operativos y logísticos para concretar este importante golpe al narcotráfico y al crimen organizado.
“Aquí tenemos el resultado del trabajo investigativo en terreno desarrollado por nuestros carabineros especializados del OS7 Coquimbo, que nos permitió generar un hito en materia de incautación de drogas, tanto por la cantidad de plantas como por la localización de las mismas. Estamos hablando de una plantación ubicada sobre 3500 metros sobre el nivel del mar, en plena cordillera del Valle del Elqui”, explicó el Prefecto de Coquimbo, Coronel Héctor Canales.
Eran pasadas las once de la mañana del martes cuando un equipo conformado por el OS7 Coquimbo, el GOPE, la Sección Aérea e Intervención, irrumpió en el sector de Quebrada el Churque, al interior de Vicuña.
Diversas diligencias investigativas previas, combinadas con un sigiloso y cuidado trabajo de inteligencia, posicionaban en el sector, una plantación con 9327 plantas en pleno proceso de crecimiento y cuyas alturas superaban incluso los dos metros.
Pero el trabajo fue más allá. La sorpresiva y efectiva irrupción policial permitió detener en el lugar, a tres hombres quienes cumplían funciones de cuidado en el sector. Dos de ellos cuentan con antecedentes y uno mantenía una orden vigente.
Además, carabineros concretó el decomiso de más de 134 kilos de marihuana elaborada, una escopeta y 96 municiones.
Desde el gobierno, valoraron el procedimiento, destacando el trabajo policial en terreno que ha permitido enfrentar los narcocultivos y el crimen organizado.
“Hemos asumido con firmeza el compromiso de proteger a las comunidades y fortalecer la seguridad en todo el territorio. Uno de los focos prioritarios es la erradicación de cultivos ilegales de droga, entendiendo que estos delitos generan un grave impacto en la tranquilidad de nuestras vecinas y vecinos. Por ello, se ha reforzado el trabajo de Carabineros en terreno, incorporando inteligencia policial, tecnología y presencia activa en sectores clave. Desarrollando una labor constante, profesional y coordinada para combatir este ilícito y prevenir el avance del narcotráfico”, concluyó la Seremi de Seguridad Pública, María José Rojas.",2025-04-17T00:47:00.000+03:00,https://www.diarioeldia.cl/noticias/2025/04/16/126186-historica-incautacion-en-el-valle-del-elqui-mas-de-9000-plantas-de-marihuana-y-tres-detenidos,@eldia_cl,positive
"Mayor Adams reverses $167M in cuts to already-bloated NYC public schools budget to expand 3-K, pre-K special education","Mayor Eric Adams is reversing nearly $170 million in proposed cuts to the already-bloated Department of Education — announcing Wednesday he’ll be expanding early childhood education programs citywide.
The $167 million, which had been left out of Adams’ preliminary budget plan for the 2026 fiscal year, will go toward expanding access to the city’s free preschool program for 3-year-olds, dubbed 3-K, and to universal pre-K special education.
“To truly make New York City the best place to raise a family, we know we must invest in our children’s future, and today, we’re making bold investments in early childhood education — to ensure our youngest students have the tools they need to succeed, and so parents don’t have to choose between earning a paycheck and caring for their children,” Adams said.
3 Mayor Eric Adams and former Mayor Bill De Blasio made an announcement about child care at DOE headquarters on Wednesday April 16th. William Farrington Hizzoner made the announcement alongside Schools Chancellor Melissa Aviles-Ramos and former Mayor Bill de Blasio, whose signature platform was expanding universal pre-K and 3-K for working class families.
Speaking later to CNN’s Dana Bash, Adams said the funds would be part of an annual commitment.
“We’re going to make it a permanent part of the government,” he said on “Inside Politics.”
The cash infusion comes after Adams said last week he’d be shelling out to hire 3,700 new teachers next year to meet the state’s new class size law mandate.
His preliminary budget, released in January, already allocated a whopping $41.2 billion for the DOE — a third of the entire city’s budget. Adams’ finalized budget plan is expected in June.
But City Council members had been calling on Adams to restore even more funding for early childhood programs — to the tune of another $30 million — in its own budget proposal this month.
3 The cash infusion comes after Adams said last week he’d be shelling out to hire 3,700 new teachers next year to meet the state’s new class size law mandate. William Farrington “I’m glad the mayor is restoring the cuts that he made. If I take $100 from you, I don’t get to tell people I just gifted you with $100 because I’m just returning the $100,” Council Committee on Finance
Chair Justin Brannan said Wednesday.
Council Speaker Adrienne Adams, who is also running for mayor, and Education Chair Rita Joseph also issued a joint statement with Brannan later Wednesday that poured cold water on Adams’ celebratory announcement.
“Access to a strong early childhood education system is imperative for working- and middle-class families to remain in our city and raise their children here,” the statement said. “While it is positive that Mayor Adams is returning and baselining some of the money withheld from his budget that the Council fought for, he is still cutting tens of millions of dollars from our children.”
The tension underscores a long-standing clash between the Council and City Hall over Adams previously similarly announcing severe budget slashes, before eventually reversing the cuts.
De Blasio, speaking on CNN alongside Adams, noted that the funding announcement comes as President Trump’s administration takes aim at the state Education Department’s resources.
3 The tension underscores a long-standing clash between the Council and City Hall over Adams previously similarly announcing severe budget slashes, before eventually reversing the cuts. William Farrington “What Mayor Adams is doing is even more important given the backdrop of what’s going on in Washington,” he told Bash.
But saving de Blasio’s sole legacy initiative wasn’t enough to snag Adams a re-election endorsement from his predecessor.
“It’s early still in this election here in New York City,” de Blasio, sitting next to Adams, said when Bash asked who he’d be backing.

Tribunal desbloquea fondos retenidos por Trump destinados a energía limpia
La jueza McElroy aceptó la solicitud antes de una futura decisión del gobierno sobre el fondo del tema.
Una jueza federal de Estados Unidos ordenó que se reanude de forma inmediata el financiamiento de miles de millones de dólares para la transición energética y la acción climática que congeló el gobierno de Donald Trump.
En su decisión emitida el martes, la jueza Mary McElroy del estado de Rhode Island consideró que si bien el presidente puede aplicar su programa ampliamente, las agencias federales ""no tienen un poder absoluto de bloquear indefinidamente dos leyes adoptadas por el Congreso bajo la administración precedente"" del demócrata Joe Biden.
Tras volver a la Casa Blanca el 20 de enero, Trump decretó la suspensión temporal de la distribución de recursos provenientes de dos leyes adoptadas por el gobierno de Biden -la Ley de Reducción de la Inflación y la Ley de Inversión en Infraestructuras y Empleo- mientras revisaba si estaban conforme a las políticas de la nueva administración.
A mediados de marzo varias organizaciones sin fines de lucro impugnaron ante la justicia la suspensión de millones de dólares de recursos destinados a proyectos de infraestructura, energía, agricultura, clima y vivienda a través de todo el país.
Los fondos provienen principalmente de los departamentos de Agricultura y de Energía así como de la agencia para protección del medio ambiente EPA, cuyas acciones son ""arbitrarias"" y sobrepasan sus poderes, según los demandantes.

'I was just doing my job': Judge throws out landlord's attempt to 'gag' Irish Independent journalist - VNExplorer,"Journalist Amy Molloy said that she had written articles concerning properties Christian Carter rented out and when he appeared on the tax defaulters list last year.A LANDLORD-TURNED-SCREENWRITER’S ATTEMPT to use new anti-stalking laws to “silence” a journalist, preventing her from writing stories about him for five years, has been thrown out of court.In his ruling today, Judge Anthony Halpin criticised Christian Carter’s attempt to “gag” Amy Molloy, the Irish Independent’s Social Affairs Correspondent, saying that was not the purpose of the civil restraining orders introduced last year.The journalist has broken stories and covered court cases about Carter’s days as a landlord and his tax affairs, Dublin District Court heard.“I was just doing my job,” the journalist emphasised when she testified.Dismissing the case, Judge Halpin declared: “I never envisaged that this forum would be used to dilute journalistic freedom or restrict publication of certain matters. The civil restraining orders became necessary because of the inability of the law to restrain offending behaviour or conduct which is socially disruptive and unacceptable.“All too often, persons directly affected by harmful conduct lack both the inclination and the resources to do anything about it and generally suffer in silence. This piece of legislation was to address these lacunae in the legal system.”He held that Carter endeavoured to use this legal remedy to “suppress” the legitimate publication of facts he did not want in the public domain.In two additional rulings, following applications by Ronan Lupton SC for the newspaper and the journalist, Judge Halpin ordered Carter to pay a €10,000 legal bill incurred by Mediahuis, the publishers of the Irish Independent, and he lifted the in-camera rule allowing the parties to be named and evidence reported.Lupton described the civil restraining order application as a collateral attack, which tramples on the right of freedom of expression.In evidence, the journalist rejected suggestions from the applicant’s solicitor, Alex Rafter, that she had stepped over the line, telling Judge Halpin she was simply seeking a comment, offering Carter the right to reply, which was a fundamental part of journalism, and “was just doing my job”.Carter claimed that the journalist had written 50 articles and had rehashed stories about him since 2017. Some of them also mentioned his sister, award-winning businesswoman Melissa Carter, and he believed that was to sell more papers.He told the court that Molloy recently attempted to contact his wife, up-and-coming Irish actress Florence Ordesh, by emailing her agent.Carter claimed this had caused him distress and depression and put him in fear because he thought it could affect his wife’s career.He said that he had moved on with his life, earned a law degree, worked in arbitration and commenced a career as a screenwriter.In evidence, the journalist said that since 2017, she had written articles concerning properties Carter rented out and when he appeared on the tax defaulters list last year.One of the properties featured in her work was a Cabinteely property, which she alleged had 70 tenants, while Carter claimed it was a 6,000 sq ft 25-roomed mansion with 40 tenants.The Circuit Court had ordered him to pay €20,000 to some of his tenants.Judge Halpin heard he was also featured in a 2017 RTÉ Investigates broadcast called Nightmare to Let.Molloy said she had written 17 or 18 pieces about the businessman concerning his issues with the Residential Tenancies Board, a council and the Revenue Commissioners.The journalist explained that a source informed her that Carter had recently travelled to various destinations, including South America, Canada, and Hawaii.Molloy explained that in light of that, she attempted to reach out to him for a comment on whether he had paid up following his settlement of nearly one million euro with the Revenue Commissioners after under-declaring income tax.She asserted: “If Mr Carter had paid his taxes and had not dangerously overcrowded houses, I would never have had to write about him.”She explained that she had only contacted his wife’s agent because it seemed that her WhatsApp messages to his phone were not received, and she thought he may have blocked her.Molloy stressed that she had no intention of mentioning the actress in her planned article.She revealed that Carter had frequently responded in a cordial way but had also previously threatened her that he could make her lose her job, and he had accused her of writing lies. She said she received some messages from him at about 1 am.She said she was shocked at his effort to take out a restraining order against her.The judge also learned that when Carter began these proceedings, he had not disclosed that he had commenced four defamation cases against media organisations, including the respondent, which are still before the High Court.Lupton described the civil restraining order attempt as a collateral attack, which tramples on the right of freedom of expression.Judge Halpin also noted that having been granted an interim order civil restraining order on 9 April, the applicant sent an email a day later to Kevin Doyle, the paper’s news editor, seeking a private compromise. “This is totally unacceptable and undermines the bona fides of his application before the court,” Judge Halpin said.“A civil, restraining order is a relief that has far reaching powers. The higher standard of proof is therefore deemed necessary in the interest of justice and in the instant case it would restrict the respondent from writing that which the public is entitled to know and would in fact amount to placing a gagging order on the journalist,” he added.In a preliminary application, at the outset of the hearing, Carter also failed in an attempt to exclude journalists from being in court to report on the proceedings.A spokesperson for Mediahuis Ireland, publishers of the Irish Independent, said: “This was an unprecedented attempt to weaponise new legislation designed to protect victims of harassment. Carter had effectively obtained an order that gagged the Irish Independent from legitimate public interest reporting. It is notable he did so by targeting an individual journalist.“Lawsuits that attempt to censor and silence the media are rightly addressed by the proposed Defamation Bill, the enactment of which must remain a key priority for the Government.“Mediahuis Ireland takes any threat to the freedom of the press extremely seriously and is therefore grateful for Judge Halpin’s unambiguous ruling. In particular we welcome the fact that he lifted reporting restrictions so that the public can be made aware of an attempt to use the law in this manner.”Carter was unavailable for comment when approached after the hearing.",2025-04-17T00:52:00.000+03:00,https://ie.vnexplorer.net/r/28907.html,VNExplorer,positive
US senator lands in El Salvador seeking release of wrongly deported Salvadoran man - VNExplorer,"FILE PHOTO: U.S. Senator Chris Van Hollen (D-MD) leads a press conference regarding legislation that would block offensive U.S. weapons sales to Israel, at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, U.S., November 19, 2024. REUTERS/Elizabeth Frantz/File PhotoSAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (Reuters) - Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen arrived in El Salvador on Wednesday morning saying he would seek to meet with senior officials from the Central American country to secure the release of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran man mistakenly deported and being held in a notorious prison.\""I just arrived in San Salvador a little while ago and look forward to meeting with the U.S. Embassy team to discuss Mr. Abrego Garcia\'s release,\"" Van Hollen, of Maryland, who is a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said in a message on his X account.\""I told his wife and family that I would do everything possible to bring him home,\"" he added. \""And we will continue working toward that goal until we achieve it.\""The government of El Salvador did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Van Hollen\'s visit.After Washington acknowledged Abrego Garcia had been deported due to an \""administrative error,\"" the U.S. Supreme Court upheld an order by Judge Paula Xinis directing the government to \""facilitate\"" Abrego Garcia\'s return.In a meeting with President Donald Trump at the White House on Monday, El Salvador\'s president, Nayib Bukele, said he had no plans to return Abrego Garcia. Earlier on Monday, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security said in a court filing that it \""does not have authority to forcibly\"" bring Abrego Garcia back.On Tuesday, Xinis said she would not immediately hold the government in contempt of court, but said there was no evidence the Trump administration had tried to retrieve Abrego Garcia and said she would not tolerate \""gamesmanship or grandstanding.\""Along with Abrego Garcia, the Trump administration has deported hundreds of people, mostly Venezuelans, whom it says are gang members to El Salvador under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 without presenting evidence and without a trial.Neither government has released the names of the men incarcerated, and the men have not had access to lawyers or any contact with the outside world since arriving at the prison.In March, after a judge said flights carrying migrants prosecuted under the Alien Enemies Act should return to the United States, Bukele wrote on X that it was too late, alongside images showing men being rushed off a plane in the dark.A federal judge on Wednesday said officials in Trump\'s administration could face criminal prosecution for contempt of court for violating his order last month halting deportations of Venezuelan migrants under the Alien Enemies Act, a wartime law.Abrego Garcia, 29, left El Salvador at age 16 to escape gang-related violence. He was granted a protective order in 2019 to continue living in the United States. He has never been charged with or convicted of any crime, according to Abrego Garcia\'s lawyers, who have denied the Justice Department\'s allegation that he is a member of the criminal gang MS-13.U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth was to meet later on Wednesday with El Salvador\'s minister of national defense, Rene Merino, at the Pentagon.(Reporting by Nelson Renteria in San Salvador and Diego Ore in Mexico City; additional reporting by Idrees Ali in Washington; Writing by Sarah Kinosian; Editing by Leslie Adler)",2025-04-17T00:39:00.000+03:00,https://ph.vnexplorer.net/r/25746.html,VNExplorer,positive
Champions: Arsenal evita «remontada» e banaliza Real no Bernabéu,"«Gunners» voltaram a ser claramente superiores ao «merengues» e venceram por 2-1 na capital espanhola. Nas meias-finais, vão defrontar o PSG
A operação «remontada» foi um autêntico fracasso! Com uma vantagem de 3-0 no bolso, o Arsenal não quebrou em casa do Real Madrid e até venceu por 2-1 em pleno Santiago Bernabéu para garantir um lugar nas meias-finais da Liga dos Campeões, onde não estava desde 2008/09.
O jogo até começou com um golo anulado a Kylian Mbappé, mas os «gunners» aguentaram-se nos minutos iniciais e podiam ter resolvido a eliminatória, não fosse o penálti falhado por Bukayo Saka (14m). Depois de um puxão de Raúl Asencio a Mikel Merino na grande área «merengue», o internacional inglês assumiu a responsabilidade de bater o penálti, mas a tentativa de Panenka saiu demasiado torta e Thibaut Courtois segurou o Real no jogo com uma sapatada na bola.
Apesar dos festejos efusivos dos anfitriões, o penálti falhado pelo Arsenal não foi o mote para uma reviravolta, como se poderia prever.
O Real Madrid esteve bastante desinspirado e a exibição na primeira parte foi um deserto de ideias. Embora tivesse mais posse de bola, a equipa de Carlo Ancelotti denotou dificuldades na organização ofensiva e nem sequer incomodou a defensiva londrina - chegou ao intervalo sem remates à baliza.
O momento de maior impasse aconteceu antes da meia-hora, quando foi assinalado penálti após uma queda de Mbappé na área dos «gunners», mas o lance foi revisto e revertido.
Com três golos de desvantagem, o Real Madrid tentou ir atrás do prejuízo no arranque do segundo tempo, mas novamente com pouca inspiração. Faltaram ideias ao conjunto «merengue», enquanto a equipa de Mikel Arteta continuou bem sólida na defesa.
Se, no ataque, o Real esteve abaixo do esperado, na defesa não foi melhor. Aos 65 minutos, o Arsenal aproveitou a passividade dos espanhóis e Saka redimiu-se do penálti falhado com uma finalização de classe na cara de Courtois.
Saka a complicar ainda mais a vida ao Real Madrid 😬

O Arsenal nem teve muito tempo para festejar, porque dois minutos depois, William Saliba relaxou quando recebeu uma bola de David Raya, deixou-se desarmar por Vinicius Júnior e o brasileiro encostou para a baliza deserta.

O Bernabéu ganhava nova injeção de confiança para ir atrás de uma noite memorável, mas a falta de capacidade para criar oportunidades de golo voltou a evidenciar-se. A um quarto de hora do final, Mbappé saiu lesionado, o que retirou ainda mais poder de fogo no ataque aos «merengues».
A história da partida só ficou fechada em tempo de descontos, quando o Arsenal garantiu o triunfo. Gabriel Martinelli arrancou ainda antes do meio-campo, ganhou na velocidade a Fran García e finalizou certeiro na cara de Courtois para colocar justiça no marcador.
O Arsenal avança com todo o mérito e vai defrontar o Paris Saint-Germain, enquanto o campeão europeu fica por terra e o destino de Carlo Ancelotti também poderá estar traçado - a saída no final da época é o cenário mais provável.",2025-04-17T00:04:00.000+03:00,https://cnnportugal.iol.pt/champions/liga-campeoes/champions-arsenal-evita-remontada-e-banaliza-real-no-bernabeu,Redação Maisfutebol,positive

Dutton pledges to bring back Howard-era technical schools - VNExplorer,"Peter Dutton wants more high schoolers to adopt trades. (ABC News: John Gunn)A Dutton government would establish a dozen technical colleges for high schoolers to learn trades and other vocational skills, reviving a Howard-era idea on a smaller scale.The colleges, with at least one in each state, will offer a hybrid of apprenticeships and traineeships and academic courses to students from years 10 to 12, operated in partnership with private companies and not-for-profits with $260 million in federal funding.\""I want to see more young Australians learn a trade, build a great career and contribute to our national success,\"" Mr Dutton said.\""Not enough students are taking up the skills we need to solve the urgent national challenges we face.\""Sussan Ley, the Coalition\'s skills spokesperson, told the ABC some of the colleges would use existing facilities, and that the school system was too heavily geared towards university attendance.\""We have always rejected the idea that if you haven\'t made it to university then you haven\'t made it in life, and that principle underpins this announcement,\"" she said.Howard-era idea abolished by Rudd, contemplated by AbbottThe Howard government established two dozen technical colleges in 2005 and had promised as many as 100, but funding was removed by the Rudd government, which deemed them outdated given the growth of the TAFE sector. All but a few closed.Tony Abbott promised a revival as opposition leader in the 2010 election, but did not carry this through when elected in 2013.The Coalition is opposed to Labor\'s multi-billion-dollar push for permanent full-fee TAFE subsidies and has confirmed it will repeal them, arguing it is poorly targeted and promising an alternative skills program of its own.Speaking at a vocational institution in Alice Springs on Tuesday, Labor\'s skills minister Andrew Giles said fee-free TAFE had been a \""runaway success\"" and had boosted enrolments\"" and said the opposition would be \""slamming shut the door of opportunity\"" on TAFE students if it proceeded with a repeal.Whichever alternative prevails after the election, the low take-up and completion rates of apprenticeships will remain a significant contributing factor to labour shortages in the construction sector, a key barrier to building more housing.Both parties have ambitions to boost housing supply but have each acknowledged the migration system may also need to be better utilised to fill the shortage, with Mr Dutton promising to prioritise trades on the skills list.",2025-04-17T00:50:00.000+03:00,https://au.vnexplorer.net/r/27854.html,VNExplorer,positive

'Cruel Irony': Judge Rips Trump's 'Unconstitutional' Ban - NewsBreak,"U.S. District Judge Ana Reyes recently issued an injunction against President Donald Trump’s ban on transgender service members, claiming that the ban violates constitutional rights. Reyes paused her ruling to provide the administration time to appeal to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. Justice Department lawyers claimed that President Trump can dictate military personnel eligibility, but Reyes countered that his authority should not infringe on the rights of marginalized individuals. Reyes wrote, “The ban is soaked in animus and dripping with pretext. Its language is unabashedly demeaning, its policy stigmatizes transgender persons as inherently unfit, and its conclusions bear no relation to fact.” Reyes added, “Indeed, the cruel irony is that thousands of transgender servicemembers have sacrificed – some risking their lives – to ensure for others the very equal protection rights the Military Ban seeks to deny them.” The legal challenge came from active-duty transgender service members and individuals hoping to enlist, who argued they would face discrimination under the policy. Reyes noted that the plaintiffs are likely to succeed in their claims against the ban. She found that the Trump administration failed to justify the broad exclusion of all transgender troops. The administration had directed the Pentagon to declare transgender individuals incompatible with military service, asserting that the ban is necessary for military effectiveness. White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller wrote, “District court judges have now decided they are in command of the Armed Forces…is there no end to this madness?” The guidance issued by the Pentagon shortly before Reyes’ ruling stated that service members diagnosed with gender dysphoria would be processed for separation and classified by biological sex. Reyes’ ruling echoes a similar ban from 2017 that faced multiple legal challenges, which temporarily blocked its implementation. The Supreme Court allowed the ban to take effect in 2019 but did not rule on its constitutionality. Approximately 4,200 active-duty, reserve, and National Guard members have been diagnosed with gender dysphoria. Reyes stated, “At times, however, leaders have used concern for military readiness to deny marginalized persons. First minorities, then women in combat, then gays filled in that blank.” John Baker covers U.S. politics & news for content partner Modern Newsstand LLC.",2025-04-17T00:40:00.000+03:00,https://local.newsbreak.com/the-news-observer-1592485/3965894778936-cruel-irony-judge-rips-trump-s-unconstitutional-ban,John Baker,positive

A resposta somos nós: demarcar as terras indígenas é o mínimo - Brasil de Fato,"Este texto é uma experimentação de escrita compartilhada. Uma co-criação entre uma pessoa indígena Pataxó e uma pessoa não indígena, que, em outros contextos, também se identificam como orientando de mestrado e orientadora, como parceiros de luta — entre os muitos lugares onde nos reconhecemos, nos unimos, e também nos tensionamos.
Partimos de uma imagem que tem nos atravessado nos últimos dias: o Acampamento Terra Livre (ATL). Reconhecemos nele um espaço de força política e ancestral dos povos indígenas — ou, de nós, povos indígenas. Do ATL, uma fala se repetiu, cresceu em coro e ganhou corpos em movimento e canto: “a resposta somos nós.”
Essa frase nasce de um mundo em crise, um mundo que tem sido pensado como fim, como utilidade, um mundo que pode findar ou onde “o céu pode cair” — como dizem algumas lideranças.
Este é o mundo onde uma exigência já não pode mais ser adiada: demarcar. “Demarcar é o mínimo”. E o mínimo carrega a denúncia: a violência estatal contida na contínua negociação daquilo que deveria ser inegociável, os territórios indígenas.
Os dados falam por si: no Brasil, cerca de 1,7 milhão de pessoas se identificam como indígenas. No entanto, apenas 21,79% vivem em domicílios situados em Terras Indígenas (TIs). A grande maioria — 78,21% — vive fora delas, muitas vezes em condições precárias, nas bordas das cidades, entre deslocamentos forçados e violências cotidianas.
Isso nos obriga a afirmar que o direito à demarcação segue sendo negado. É um direito sagrado, mas seu reconhecimento continua lento. E isso tem causas claras. Ao escutarmos lideranças indígenas, e também aliados que se somam à luta, compreendemos melhor os elementos que travam os processos. No Brasil, os interesses políticos seguem emperrando as demarcações. Essa história já dura 525 anos. E não queremos mais discursos. Queremos ação. Urgente.
A garantia dos territórios também passa por potencializar a soberania daqueles que vivem em territórios demarcados, garantir saúde, educação de qualidade, garantir que as terras não sejam invadidas por garimpeiros, madeireiros e fazendeiros.
Garantir o território também é garantir a vida das pessoas e, nesse sentido, queremos lembrar o que as mulheres indígenas têm nos ensinado com firmeza e generosidade: corpo é território, território é corpo.
Para os povos indígenas, o corpo não se separa da terra. Ele foi o primeiro território a ser invadido, colonizado, e o primeiro a resistir. Como diz a deputada federal Célia Xakriabá (Psol):
“O nosso corpo é o nosso primeiro território. Quando falamos de demarcação de terras, também estamos falando de demarcar os nossos corpos, nossos modos de ser, de viver e de existir.”
A existência indígena segue ameaçada, mas também segue viva e potente, abrindo caminhos para outras formas de vida neste planeta. São esses muitos povos que continuam a ouvir a floresta, que sustentam a certeza de que a vida não é mercadoria, e que, às vezes, é preciso segurar o céu com as mãos — gesto de cuidado com todos nós.
Essa história já dura 525 anos. E não queremos mais discursos. Queremos ação
Que as universidades, as escolas, os governos e os espaços políticos saibam escutar o que vem da terra. A demarcação não é concessão — é o mínimo.
E é nesse mínimo que garantimos o máximo, daí a “resposta”: vidas indígenas garantidas em sua potência, universidades indigenizadas, corpos e mentes potencializados pelas diversas outras formas de existir.””””””””””””””””””””’

"Novo PAC já promoveu R$ 6,8 bilhões em investimentos para Mato Grosso do Sul","De acordo com dados divulgados pelo Governo Federal, R$ 18,6 bilhões em investimentos do Novo PAC previstos até o fim de 2026 no Estado de Mato Grosso do Sul, R$ 6,8 bilhões já foram executados, o que significa 36,8% do total em pouco mais de 3 meses. Além disso, conforme os dados, outros R$ 5,5 bilhões estão projetados para o período pós-2026, o que totaliza R$ 24,1 bilhões em ações voltadas para o Estado.
Os investimentos estão distribuídos entre obras finalizadas, outras em execução, além de investimentos em saúde, educação, transporte e principalmente, em habitação, tendo em vista que há um total de 21.330 unidades do Minha Casa, Minha Vida sendo construídas, que serão destinadas a Mato Grosso do Sul.
Entre os empreendimentos financiados com recursos do Novo PAC já concluídos em Mato Grosso do Sul estão:
- Obras de ampliação do Sistema de Esgotamento Sanitário (SES);
- Construção, ampliação ou reforma de escolas e creches e a construção de ou cobertura de quadras esportivas;
- Entrega de 14 ônibus escolares;
- Construção de Centro de Convivência, Complexo Esportivo, aquisição de equipamentos e estruturas acadêmicas em campi do Instituto Federal de Mato Grosso do Sul;
- Entrega de 19 ambulâncias do Samu;
- Retomada ou construção de duas Unidades Básicas de Saúde;
- Nova pista e um novo terminal no Aeroporto de Dourados;
- Duas novas linhas de transmissão de energia;
- Obras de manutenção e restauração em rodovias que cortam o Estado.
Os empreendimentos já concluídos beneficiam moradores de 24 municípios do Estado, entre eles, as cinco maiores cidades de Mato Grosso do Sul: Campo Grande, Dourados, Três Lagoas, Corumbá e Ponta Porã.
Cabe ressaltar que, não apenas em Mato Grosso do Sul, mas no cenário nacional, até o fim de 2024, o Novo PAC já executou R$ 711 bilhões em investimentos, mais da metade (53,7%) do total de R$ 1,3 trilhão previsto até o fim de 2026. O programa prevê, além destes recursos, outros R$ 500 bilhões para investimentos após 2026, totalizando, assim, R$ 1,8 trilhão.
NOVO PAC
A sistematização dos investimentos, por meio do Novo PAC, colabora para que o Governo Federal cumpra os compromissos da universalização do saneamento básico, a inclusão digital, o acesso ampliado à saúde e educação, melhoria das rodovias federais, portos e aeroportos, além da oferta de moradia digna, segurança hídrica e geração de energia.
O programa estimula a inovação científica, o desenvolvimento sustentável e a modernização da indústria nacional, em um esforço entre os governos federal, estaduais, municipais e setor privado para acelerar o crescimento do país.
O Novo PAC ajuda o Brasil a crescer, gerar empregos, criar mecanismos para o desenvolvimento sustentável, destravar a economia, impulsionar e aprofundar a relação entre Estado e mercado e, principalmente, ter o povo no centro dos empreendimentos, por meio de consultas diretas aos governos estaduais e municipais e aos movimentos populares.
Dos R$ 711 bilhões em investimentos do Novo PAC, R$ 345,7 bilhões tiveram como origem recursos privados, R$ 183,1 bilhões de financiamentos e R$ 106 bilhões de estatais com projetos incluídos no programa. Além disso, R$ 71,3 bilhões são provenientes do Orçamento Geral da União (OGU) e R$ 5,1 bilhões, de fundos setoriais.
Conforme o secretário especial do Novo PAC na Casa Civil, Maurício Muniz, há um diálogo constante entre os stados e municípios para que estes empreendimentos realizados com recursos federais, mas com gestão local – ganhem mais agilidade em sua execução. “Para isso, é importante o diálogo, principalmente, com as prefeituras e governos estaduais para que os empreendimentos avancem e sejam entregues”, afirmou.
Para quem quiser consultar as informações, o site do novo PAC foi atualizado com informações até dezembro de 2024 e conta com novos dados por empreendimentos, como estimativa do valor total, estágio da obra, percentual de execução, classificação e tipo de executor.
QUAIS SÃO OS PRINCIPAIS INVESTIMENTOS?
MINHA CASA, MINHA VIDA - O programa retomou o Minha Casa, Minha Vida, que volta a transformar a realidade de milhares de brasileiros. Até dezembro de 2024, foram contratadas 1,3 milhão de novas moradias com um investimento total de R$ 190 bilhões. Dessas, mais de 80% (1.047.829) já foram entregues. Até o início do Novo PAC, muitas obras estavam paralisadas ou em ritmo lento. Desde então, mais de 43 mil moradias que estavam nessa condição foram entregues, beneficiando cerca de 173 mil pessoas.
ÁGUA PARA TODOS - Outro destaque é o eixo Água Para Todos, que busca garantir o acesso universal à água potável e a segurança hídrica. Em dois anos, já foram entregues 191 empreendimentos de abastecimento de água e mais de 54 mil cisternas.
SAÚDE - Desde a retomada do Novo PAC, 1.478 municípios com vazios assistenciais – em territórios de maior vulnerabilidade social e econômica – foram selecionados para receber novas Unidades Básicas de Saúde (UBS). Com processos licitatórios e de contratação já autorizados, mais de 370 municípios já iniciaram as obras. Além disso, 2.222 novas ambulâncias do SAMU foram entregues.
TRANSPORTE EFICIENTE E SUSTENTÁVEL - Desde 2023, os empreendimentos do eixo Transporte Eficiente e Sustentável garantiram o avanço da condição da malha rodoviária federal. A proporção de rodovias com boas condições de tráfego saltou de 50% em dezembro de 2022 para 75% em dezembro de 2024. A ampliação da malha ferroviária – com investimentos na Ferrovia Transnordestina, na Integração Oeste-Leste (FIOL) e na Integração do Centro-Oeste (FICO) – tem fortalecido a logística do país.
TRANSIÇÃO E SEGURANÇA ENERGÉTICA - A carteira de investimentos na área de segurança e transição energética segue crescendo. Até 2026, foram previstos R$ 466,7 bilhões em investimentos. Do total de empreendimentos, 363 (40%) já estão concluídos e 35% estão em execução, restando 25% em fase de preparação ou licitação.
EDUCAÇÃO, C&T - São 990 empreendimentos já concluídos, entre creches, escolas, quadras e coberturas de quadras. Mais de 800 municípios já receberam transporte escolar. O Novo PAC garante, ainda, R$ 2,5 bilhões para implantação de 101 novos campi de Institutos Federais (IFs) em 98 municípios. Serão mais 140 mil novas vagas, além de possibilitar a contratação de 11.400 novos servidores, em até cinco anos.
CONECTIVIDADE - Até dezembro de 2024, o Novo PAC garantiu a conectividade em mais de 70 mil escolas, o que equivale a mais da metade das escolas públicas do ensino básico de todo o país. A meta é universalizar, até 2026, a conectividade em 138 mil escolas públicas, seguindo padrões da Estratégia Nacional de Escolas Conectadas.",2025-04-17T00:30:00.000+03:00,https://correiodoestado.com.br/cidades/novo-pac-ja-promoveu-r-68-bilhoes-em-investimentos-para-mato-grosso/446838,Tamires Santana,positive
Putin quer Marte! Rússia pode estar de volta à corrida espacial,"O presidente da Rússia, Vladimir Putin, declarou, nesta quarta-feira (16), via agência Interfax, que seu país e a China estão desenvolvendo projetos conjuntos de grande envergadura para a exploração espacial. Segundo ele, Moscou mantém firme seu compromisso com programas de investigação do Espaço profundo, que englobam missões à Lua e a Marte, e tem atraído o interesse de diversas nações além de Pequim.
Enquanto Rússia e China se unem por Marte…
- O bilionário Elon Musk, fundador da SpaceX e atualmente conselheiro do governo Donald Trump, nutre, há tempos, o desejo de enviar uma expedição tripulada a Marte;
- Em 15 de março, ele declarou que o foguete Starship da SpaceX tem cronograma para ser enviado ao Planeta Vermelho em 2026;
- Do lado estadunidense, o próprio presidente Donald Trump aproveitou seu primeiro discurso após assumir o cargo para reafirmar a intenção de levar astronautas dos Estados Unidos a Marte:
- “Os Estados Unidos voltarão a ser uma nação em expansão, ampliando nossa riqueza, estendendo nossos domínios e fincando nossa bandeira em novos e magníficos horizontes. Nosso objetivo é enviar americanos para cravar as estrelas e listras no solo marciano”, afirmou.

Vale lembrar que a rivalidade entre Estados Unidos e Rússia na corrida espacial remonta ao período anterior ao histórico pouso lunar, em 20 de julho de 1969, quando ambas as potências disputavam quem chegaria primeiro à superfície da Lua.
Antes disso, no contexto da Guerra Fria, os países queriam enviar a primeira pessoa ao Espaço — vitória soviética, que mandou Iuri Gagarin em 12 de abril de 1961.
O que será da permanência humana no espaço depois do fim da ISS?
A Estação Espacial Internacional (ISS) encerrará suas atividades em janeiro de 2031. Depois disso, a NASA irá tirar o laboratório da órbita da Terra para que ela faça uma reentrada ardente na atmosfera e caia em uma área remota do Oceano Pacifico. Desde o seu lançamento em novembro de 2000, ela tem garantido a permanência humana constante no espaço, mas depois do sim fim, ainda restará alguém no espaço?
Para quem tem pressa:
- A ISS está com data marcada para seu fim, mas a permanência humana constante no espaço está garantida;
- A Estação Espacial Chinesa Tiangong está em operação desde 2021 e deverá permanecer na órbita por mais alguns anos;
- Além dela também existem outros laboratórios orbitais que serão lançados em breve como a Estação Axiom e a Estação de Serviço Orbital Russa (ROSS);
- A Lua também ganhará uma representante nos próximos anos, a Estação Espacial Gateway.
Estação Espacial Tiangong
Bem, a ISS não é a única estação espacial na órbita da Terra, além dela ainda existe a Tiangong, a estação espacial chinesa. Sua construção iniciou em abril de 2021 e atualmente já conta com três módulos. A expectativa é que no futuro o laboratório receba mais três módulos e dobre de tamanho.
A previsão de duração da Estação Espacial Tiangong é de cerca de 10 anos, mas com a adição de novos módulos, talvez ela dure um pouco mais. Isso significa que mesmo após o fim da ISS, a China poderá dar continuidade à permanência humana contínua no espaço.
Laboratórios orbitais que serão lançados nos próximos anos
Além da Tiangong, empresas privadas também estão se programando para lançar suas estações espaciais, uma delas a Estação Axiom. Nos próximos anos a Axiom Space irá lançar módulos que serão acoplados a ISS com intuito de atividades comerciais espaciais. Quando a Estação Espacial Internacional deixar de operar, ela irá se separar, e passará a orbitar a Terra sozinha.

Oshkosh distinguished alumni honored in ceremony,"Oshkosh distinguished alumni honored in ceremony
OSHKOSH, Wis. (WBAY) - A special ceremony was held Wednesday to honor distinguished alumni of the Oshkosh Area School District.
Janette Fennell graduated from Oshkosh West in 1972 and is the founder and president of Kids and Car Safety.
Her advocacy has led to numerous advancements in safety features, including trunk release mechanisms, which she developed after a traumatic experience in 1995 when she and her family were kidnapped and locked in the trunk of their car.
Not one person has died since the implementation of the trunk release mechanism in 2002.
“We work to save kids’ lives, you don’t think about awards for doing that type of work, you just think about saving lives, so this is a nice little whipped cream on top of the sundae,” said Fennell.

Prioritize People Over Medicine in Health Care | Mirage News,"Achieving a Socialised Model of Health Care in Australia with Nurse Leadership
The Australian College of Nursing (ACN) is calling for a fundamental rethink of Australia's approach to health care in the next term of government, with the current system persistently failing to address key factors that affect health and wellbeing, like poor nutrition, housing and poverty.
An ACN White Paper, Achieving a Socialised Model of Health Care in Australia with Nurse Leadership proposes a fundamental shift away from the current model, which focuses on diagnosing and treating diseases rather than addressing social determinants of health.
A more holistic approach to health is critical amid growing inequities in health and soaring rates of chronic disease and lifestyle-related conditions, many of which are preventable.
Implementing a 'socialised healthcare model', where more attention is given to preventive health and circumstances that lead to illness would better address the health needs of the most vulnerable in the community. In such a system, a patient struggling with homelessness would be more likely to be referred to a housing provider, or to support services for substance use or mental health.
Nurses are already delivering socialised care in Australia via nurse-led primary care clinics, school-based youth health nursing initiatives, and mobile nurse-led street health services, but they are excluded from access to Medicare.
""It is a travesty that nurses have to battle very traditional funding models in their effort to deliver care to Australia's most vulnerable, people often not catered to by traditional healthcare facilities,"" said ACN CEO, Adjunct Professor Kathryn Zeitz FACN.
""The existing biomedical healthcare model in Australia puts medicine at the centre of care, rather than people. Causes of disease are not being addressed promptly, leading to poor health that requires increasing amounts of care, attention, and treatment.
""As the largest, most geographically spread, and appropriately educated and qualified health workforce, nurses are ideally placed to provide much-needed health services to vulnerable and disadvantaged people who have difficulty accessing the services they need when they need them most,"" said Adjunct Professor Zeitz.
""ACN wants to see a seismic shift to embrace a socialised model of health care, which identifies the role that the social determinants of health play in poor health outcomes and impeding equity-based health care.
Recommendations
The Australian College of Nursing (ACN) urges federal, state, and territory governments to:
- Review the health care funding model to include socialised models of health care and funding for nurse-led models of care.
- Develop national guidelines for health education providers to embed socialised models of health care into all aspects of the Nursing and Midwifery curriculum.
- Promote a workplace environments that encourages understanding and awareness of social determinants of health.

"Con gol de Lautaro Martínez, Inter se metió en semifinales de Champions League","El Nerazzurri igualó 2 a 2 con Bayern Múnich en Italia con un tanto del Toro y por el 2 a 1 de la ida se insertó entre los cuatro mejores de Europa: ahora será rival de Barcelona.
Inter hizo valer el 2-1 conseguido en Allianz Arena, empató 2-2 con Bayern Múnich en el Estadio Giuseppe Meazza y se clasificó a la semifinal de la UEFA Champions League. El conjunto alemán se puso en ventaja a través de Harry Kane, pero Lautaro Martínez y Benjamín Pavard, en una ráfaga, lo dieron vuelta para el Nerazzurri. La igualdad de Eric Dier no alcanzó y los locales avanzaron a la próxima ronda, donde se enfrentarán con Barcelona, que viene de dejar afuera a Borussia Dortmund.
Tras un primer tiempo disputado, con pocas llegadas y aún menos emociones, el complemento llegó cargado. A los siete minutos, tras un centro pasado de León Goretzka, Harry Kane controló por el segundo palo, amagó y sacó un preciso remate cruzado que se metió pegada al palo derecho de Yann Sommer y empató momentáneamente la serie para los de Vincent Kompany.
Sin embargo, lejos de sentir el golpe, los dirigidos por Simeone Inzaghi reaccionaron rápido y, tras un córner desde la izquierda y un rebote , Lautaro Martínez sacó una volea al segundo palo que devolvía la ventaja en el global para los locales. Para colmo, apenas tres minutos más tarde, sobre el cuarto de hora de juego, otro tiro de esquina pero desde derecha fue a la cabeza de Benjamin Pavard, que liquidó a Jonas Urbig y estiraba la ventaja.
Embed ADEMÁS: Atlanta, San Martín (T) y Gimnasia (M): los líderes invictos de la Primera Nacional A los 30 minutos, llegó otra reacción de los alemanes. Michael Olise movió un córner corto para Serge Gnabry, quien controló y metió un centro pasado para Eric Dier que, sin ángulo, metió un gran cabezazo por arriba que empató el encuentro y le puso suspenso al cruce.
El Inter pudo aguantar el 2-2 y se terminó quedando con la clasificación ante Bayern Múnich con un global 4-3. El equipo de Lautaro Martínez se metió en las semifinales de la Champions League, donde se verá las caras con Barcelona , que eliminó a Borussia Dortmund. Del otro lado, París Saint-Germain y Arsenal definirán al otro finalista.

Texas House approves nearly $8B for public school funding | FOX 4 Dallas-Fort Worth,"The Brief Lawmakers in Austin passed the largest public school funding bill in state history. Some have argued it should be larger to account for inflation. Now the table is set for a big debate on Wednesday night about additional money for private school vouchers. DALLAS - The Texas House passed the largest public school funding bill in state history on Wednesday, dedicating nearly $8 billion to key parts of public education.
It sets the table for a lengthy fight over school vouchers.
House Bill 2 What's new:
HB 2 increases per-student funding, teacher pay, and special needs funding, among other things.
Only four members of the Texas House voted against it.
But some have described it as a ""carrot and stick"" situation.
While a majority of House members agree that public schools need more funding, there is still division, at least between Democrats and Republicans, about Senate Bill 2, which sets aside another $1 billion to give parents state money for private school tuition.

article LIVE UPDATES: Texas House passes school funding bill, expected to vote on school vouchers The Texas House is expected to vote on a controversial school choice bill on Wednesday.
The other side:
Some lawmakers expressed concern that HB 2’s $7.7 billion for public schools is not enough to account for inflation.
""Will this bill catch us up to 2019 levels, yes or no?"" asked Rep. James Talarico.
""This is a bipartisan effort to close the gap,"" replied Rep. Brad Buckley.
""I’m going to take that as a no until I get a yes,"" Talarico said.
School voucher bill returns to Texas House floor After failing in the last legislative session, school vouchers are back on the house floor and this time there's a high likelihood they will pass this time.
What's next:
The House is now debating SB 2, which is expected to pass. It would then go back to the Senate.
If the legislation passes, it will be the largest school voucher program in the country.
It would also be the first time the House has passed a school voucher bill. Last session, it failed in multiple special sessions.
But Gov. Greg Abbott made it his top priority for this year and campaigned against Republicans who voted against it last year.
The governor and President Donald Trump met with Republicans by phone on Wednesday morning about the importance of passing the bill.

En abril el INEA alfabetiza a 456 mil 163 jóvenes y adultos en todo el país: Mario Delgado
- Se fortalece la Estrategia Nacional para la Alfabetización, impulsada por el Gobierno de la Presidenta Claudia Sheinbaum Pardo.
- Esta semana el director general del INEA, Armando Contreras Castillo, firmó acuerdos con los gobiernos de Morelos y Zacatecas en beneficio de 50 mil personas que aún no saben leer ni escribir.
La Secretaría de Educación Pública (SEP) alfabetiza, durante el mes de abril, a 456 mil 163 jóvenes y adultos de todo el país mediante los servicios educativos gratuitos que ofrece el Instituto Nacional para la Educación de los Adultos (INEA), informó el titular de la dependencia, Mario Delgado Carrillo.
Resaltó que la oferta educativa del INEA está dirigida a personas de 15 años en adelante que no tuvieron la oportunidad de cursar o concluir su Educación Básica en el sistema escolarizado, ofreciéndoles servicios de alfabetización en español y lenguas indígenas, con un enfoque bilingüe para comunidades originarias, así como educación primaria y secundaria con certificación oficial de la SEP.
Destacó que estas acciones forman parte de la Estrategia Nacional para la Alfabetización, impulsada por el Gobierno de la presidenta Claudia Sheinbaum Pardo, a través de la cual el INEA ofrece alternativas de estudio y horarios flexibles que permiten cursar la primaria y la secundaria en línea, desde un dispositivo electrónico, así como acreditar los niveles de Educación Básica mediante exámenes y con el acompañamiento de guías de estudio.
Delgado Carrillo afirmó que la alfabetización es la base de la educación, de la identidad y de la diversidad cultural, ya que permite comprender mejor al otro, entender lo que nos hace diferentes, y sentir empatía, compasión y solidaridad.
Por su parte el director general del INEA, Armado Contreras Castillo, recordó que, en sus 43 años de existencia, el Instituto ha brindado servicios a más de 31 millones de mujeres y hombres, a través de su programa de educación especializada para personas adultas, con el objetivo de que puedan concluir sus estudios y ejercer su derecho a una educación libre y gratuita.
Mencionó que el modelo educativo del INEA opera bajo los principios de la Nueva Escuela Mexicana (NEM) y del humanismo mexicano, brindando un acompañamiento educativo de calidad que sitúa a las personas educandas en el centro del proceso formativo, y promueve valores de igualdad, amor y conciencia para fomentar una cultura de paz.
Añadió que, de acuerdo con la Organización de las Naciones Unidas para la Educación, la Ciencia y la Cultura (UNESCO), para construir una cultura de paz son necesarias actividades educativas, culturales, sociales y cívicas de carácter general, que ofrezcan la oportunidad de aprender, dar y compartir.
Finalmente, señaló que la atención educativa que brinda el INEA constituye una labor de conciencia social, en la que desempeña un papel fundamental el apoyo de personas voluntarias, quienes colaboran en distintas tareas de asesoramiento y acompañamiento durante el proceso educativo de quienes así lo requieren.
INEA continua con la firma de acuerdos de la Estrategia Nacional para la Alfabetización
Con el Gobierno del estado de Morelos se consolidó una alianza orientada a combatir el rezago educativo en la entidad, donde se estima que alrededor de 30 mil personas aún no saben leer ni escribir. El director general del INEA, Armando Contreras Castillo, y la gobernadora de la entidad, Margarita González Saravia, coincidieron en que la colaboración entre instituciones es clave para cumplir con la meta nacional de erradicar el analfabetismo en 2026.
En Zacatecas, el director general del INEA, Armando Contreras Castillo signó el convenio de colaboración “México Libre de Analfabetismo”, con el propósito de ampliar el acceso a la educación y avanzar hacia un estado con mayores oportunidades para todas y todos.

Lincoln honors 911 call center workers amid nationwide shortage,"Lincoln honors 911 call center workers amid nationwide shortage
LINCOLN, Neb. (KOLN) - In the midst of a national staffing shortage at 911 call centers, the City of Lincoln said it’s also in need of more telecommunications workers, taking this week to honor what they do.
At the new Lincoln Emergency Communications 911 Center on Wednesday, city officials gathered to share about the important work done by dispatchers, calling them a central link between the public and first responders.
Mayor Leirion Gaylor Baird also signed a proclamation marking this as National Public Safety Telecommunicator Week in Lincoln.
Jessica Loos, the center’s director, said there’s currently 14 openings for call takers, as well as other roles that haven’t been filled in more than a decade.
She adds the center still meets its minimum staffing numbers for each shift, but occasionally she has to mandate overtime or call in workers to meet that standard.
“I don’t know that there’s a better center you can start your career in with 911,” she said. “While we have openings, I’m very confident we’re going to find the individuals that belong here.”
Loos said that those mandates are no secret, and it’s something she tries to be upfront about when hiring new staff.
The LECC also offers a training academy to prepare workers for the half a million calls the center fields every year.
“Not a job for anybody,” Loos said. “We don’t just want somebody picking up your call just to answer your call, we want somebody that’s committed to doing the right thing, getting you the right resource.”
Emma Gettemy, who’s worked for the center twice now, said every day is different. And while it can be stressful, she takes pride in making Lincoln a safer place.
“You have to have the passion for it, and that really helps you build resilience,” Gettemy said. “We cover for each other, we support each other. I know it’s hard for us to always get the days and times off, but we’re here cause we love it and we love helping the Lincoln community.”

Al igual que en la primera vuelta, Luisa González, candidata presidencial por la Revolución Ciudadana, tuvo una victoria contundente en la votación carcelaria en el balotaje, frente al presidente reelecto Daniel Noboa.
Hasta finales de marzo de 2025, según datos del Servicio de Atención a Personas Privadas de la Libertad (SNAI), en las 35 cárceles del país había 34.380 presos. De ese número, solo 4.274 estuvieron habilitados para sufragar el 10 de abril de 2025. Es decir, un 12,43%.
De los habilitados, solo 1.143 se presentaron a votar en las juntas que se instalaron en los centros de detención. En definitiva, solo el 3,32% de los detenidos en prisiones ecuatorianas votaron para elegir Presidente de la República.
Según la normativa ecuatoriana, los presos que no han sido sentenciados, es decir, quienes cumplen prisión preventiva, pueden votar en las elecciones. Para la primera vuelta hubo 6.140 personas habilitadas para votar y para el balotaje el padrón penitenciario se redujo en un 30%.
PRIMICIAS revisó los resultados de las juntas receptoras del voto de todas las prisiones. De los 1.143 votantes, seis dejaron la papeleta en blanco y otros 36 anularon su sufragio. Lo que significa que hubo únicamente 1.101 votos válidos, 17% menos que en la primera vuelta.
Dentro de los votos válidos, el 96,19% (1.059 votos) fueron a favor de Luisa González, candidata de la Revolución Ciudadana (RC). El presidente reelecto Daniel Noboa, en cambio, obtuvo 42 sufragios, lo que significó un 3,81% de la votación carcelaria.
Los votos en cada prisión
Al revisar la votación de los presos ecuatorianos, cárcel por cárcel, se evidencia que González ganó en 29 de las 35 prisiones. En las cárceles de Alausí (Chimborazo), El Rodeo (Portoviejo), Machala (El Oro), La Roca (Guayas) y Chillogallo (Pichincha) ninguno de los votantes habilitados se presentó. Hubo un 100% de ausentismo en los cinco centros.
Mientras que en la cárcel de Ambato, en Tungurahua, dos presos votaron por cada uno de los candidatos, por lo que hubo un empate.
En cuanto a la votación de Luisa González, la mayor cantidad de apoyos fue en la Penitenciaría del Litoral, en Guayaquil. 326 presos votaron por ella en esa prisión. Mientras que el mejor resultado para Noboa fue en la Cárcel de Loja, con 14 votos.
A continuación, puede revisar los datos de votación de cada prisión del país, por provincia o por candidato:

'We might have an Ireland manager there' - Brady tips Duff in top job,"'We might have an Ireland manager there' — Brady tips Duff in top job
Liam Brady has tipped his fellow Ireland legend Damien Duff to manage the national team one day.
Although Brady believes Heimir Hallgrímsson has a chance of leading Ireland into the playoffs for next year’s World Cup, Duff is one he can foresee taking the reins.
Brady worked with Duff when he was assistant to Giovanni Trapattoni, the trio part of the Ireland unit that pushed France in the playoff for the 2010 World Cup.
For someone who seems so averse to managing in his playing career, Duff has revelled in the migration, guiding Shelbourne to their first title in 18 years in only his third season as a senior boss.
Champions League exposure awaits the 46-year-old in the summer and former Arsenal playmaker Brady has been observing his burgeoning managerial career thrive from afar.
“Damien was always serious about his football, a very good trainer,” Brady recalls over their two years together in the Ireland camp.
“I can see he’s a hard task master with his players. He demanded that of himself really. We might have an Ireland manager there for the future.
“I think Damien’s learning now. He’s going to learn in the Champions League too, that's another string to his bow.” Ireland head into the June friendlies against Senegal and Luxembourg having preserved their place in the second tier of next year’s Uefa Nations League.
A couple of 2-1 victories over Bulgaria in March brought encouragement to Brady about the qualifiers beginning in September.
Ireland take on Portugal, Hungary and Armenia, with 72-times capped Brady fancying their prospects of being in the mix to reach the showpiece next year co-hosted by USA, Canada and Mexico.
Hallgrímsson led Iceland to the 2016 Euros and 2018 World Cup as well as Jamaica to the African Cup of Nations last summer.
“I saw green shoots against Bulgaria, if you excuse the pun,” he noted. “There is a bit more confidence about the team. Winning helps confidence, helps belief. I think the manager is going about it the right way, the World Cup is not undoable.
If you think we can beat Bulgaria over two legs home and away, we might be able to finish second to Portugal. That was the way back in my day with Jack. When we qualified, we finished second, now you go to the playoff. I think there is something there, I’m pleased to say after a few barren years.
“Stephen Kenny has to be given credit for giving all these kids early debuts and exposure to international football. And this new guy might pick up the pay-off from that. A lot of the kids have played over 20 games now. His track record is very good.”
Brady enlisted several Irish cadets during his time leading Arsenal’s academy but the landscape has shifted since 2021 when Brexit raises the age for emigrants to 18. He’s pleased that St Patrick’s Athletic have pocketed €1.5m from the Gunners’ North London rivals Tottenham Hotspur for Mason Melia, who heads to Spurs at the end of the season.
“Clubs are going to do that if they have a special player like that,” he stated. “I just hope the money goes back in, clubs realise that this is what we can do if we have good players and we coach them well.
“Players in those two years between 16 and 18 need to get good coaching, competitive matches are play in good facilities. My guess is they’re probably not.
“But I suppose his (Melia’s) profile came about because he was playing with the first team.”",2025-04-17T01:00:00.000+03:00,https://www.irishexaminer.com/sport/soccer/arid-41615047.html,John Fallon,positive
Petro ofrece asilo a opositores ecuatorianos tras denuncia de persecución política por el gobierno de Noboa,"El presidente colombiano, Gustavo Petro, anunció que su país otorgará asilo a opositores políticos ecuatorianos, luego de que se filtrara una lista negra de al menos cien personas —entre ellas periodistas y miembros del movimiento Revolución Ciudadana— inhabilitadas para salir del país por órdenes del gobierno de Daniel Noboa.
«Le daremos asilo a todo el que llegue a territorio colombiano», aseguró Petro a través de su cuenta en la red X, al tiempo que denunció la detención de observadores electorales colombianos en Ecuador como parte de esta ola de represión.
La reacción del mandatario colombiano ocurre tras una serie de denuncias que evidencian la escalada autoritaria en Ecuador, donde se ha impuesto un estado de excepción y se ha militarizado el proceso electoral.
Petro cuestionó la legitimidad de los comicios organizados por el Consejo Nacional Electoral de Ecuador, afirmando que “el Ejército dirigió la jornada electoral, las mesas durante las elecciones, y el conteo de votos. No hay elecciones libres bajo estado de sitio”.
En la mañana del miércoles, el expresidente ecuatoriano Rafael Correa alertó sobre una alerta migratoria contra integrantes de la Revolución Ciudadana, lo que ha derivado en intentos de detención de figuras políticas clave.
Uno de los casos más alarmantes es el de Diego Borja, compañero de fórmula presidencial de RC, quien denunció haber sido detenido junto a su familia cuando intentaba viajar a Colombia. El hecho fue calificado como un acto arbitrario.

También Verónica Sarauz, viuda del asesinado candidato presidencial Fernando Villavicencio, fue víctima de persecución política cuando trataba de ingresar al país.
Diversos actores internacionales y nacionales han repudiado los resultados de la segunda vuelta electoral en Ecuador, apuntando a irregularidades como actas sin firma, estado de excepción vigente y un clima de persecución generalizada.

Azerbaijani Journalist Afgan Sadygod Released on Bail - Civil Georgia,"Azerbaijani journalist Afgan Sadygov was released on bail on April 16 after the Tbilisi City Court granted a prosecutor’s request to replace his extradition detention, the Social Justice Center (SJC) reported .
The SJC, a human rights watchdog representing Sadygov, said his extradition custody was set to expire on May 3, the maximum nine-month period allowed under Georgian law. “Therefore, the Georgian prosecutor had to ask the court to change the form of pre-trial restriction,” the group said.
The SJC argued that no restrictions should have been applied. The court eventually released Sadygov on bail of GEL 5,000 (about $1,800).
The court’s decision follows a February ruling by the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR), which barred Georgia from extraditing Sadygov until a final judgment is issued, which could take years. The imprisoned journalist ended his 161-day hunger strike shortly after hearing the ECtHR’s decision.
Sadygov has reportedly lived in Georgia since December 2023. He was previously arrested in Azerbaijan in 2020 on extortion charges and sentenced to seven years in prison, later reduced to four years by the Supreme Court. He was released after about two years under an amnesty, following a 242-day hunger strike while in prison.
In Georgia, he was arrested in August 2024. Earlier, he was denied permission to travel to Turkey and told at the Tbilisi airport that his only option was to return to Azerbaijan.

零售總額增4.6% 新消費成長前景好 - 內地 - 香港文匯網,"一季度，限額以上單位通訊器材類商品零售額同比增長26.9%，文化辦公用品類增長21.7%，家用電器和音像器材類增長19.3%，傢具類增長18.1%。盛來運提到，僅上述4項就拉動社會消費品零售總額增長1.4個百分點。此外，商務部數據顯示，截至4月8日零時，消費者累計購買12大類家電以舊換新產品3,571萬台，發起汽車以舊換新補貼申請208.5萬份，有力促進了消費的回升。
香港文匯報訊（記者 朱燁 北京報道）國家統計局數據顯示，一季度，社會消費品零售總額同比增長4.6%，比去年全年提升了1.1個百分點，幅度較大。國家統計局副局長盛來運認為，其中，「兩重」「兩新」政策，尤其是消費品以舊換新政策效果明顯，像電動自行車、手機、平板、智能手錶等新擴圍產品的銷售增速非常高。
一季度，限額以上單位通訊器材類商品零售額同比增長26.9%，文化辦公用品類增長21.7%，家用電器和音像器材類增長19.3%，傢具類增長18.1%。盛來運提到，僅上述4項就拉動社會消費品零售總額增長1.4個百分點。此外，商務部數據顯示，截至4月8日零時，消費者累計購買12大類家電以舊換新產品3,571萬台，發起汽車以舊換新補貼申請208.5萬份，有力促進了消費的回升。
服務消費增長加快
談及消費市場呈現的主要特點，盛來運表示，一是市場銷售穩步回升；二是商品零售增長較快；三是服務消費方興未艾；四是消費新動能持續釋放。
從一季度數據來看，在提振消費相關政策的支撐下，服務消費增長加快。一季度，服務零售額同比增長5%，比商品零售快了0.4個百分點。與消費結構升級相關的消費保持兩位數增長。一季度，居民人均交通通信支出同比增長10.4%，教育文化娛樂支出增長13.9%。「服務消費是我們未來支撐消費增長的一個非常重要的領域，而且發展成長性、發展空間都非常大。」盛來運說。
消費場景不斷拓展
此外，隨着大數據、人工智能加速運用，一些新的消費場景不斷創新和拓展，比如直播帶貨、即時零售，「夜經濟」、數字消費、AI遊戲等。一些文化類消費較快增長，《哪吒2》持續火爆，票房收入已經突破150億元。這些新的消費場景不斷拓展、新的消費產品不斷創新，既顯示了中國消費創新的動力，也顯示了新消費的成長前景。
盛來運說，下一步，我們要按照黨中央、國務院決策部署，認真落實好《提振消費專項行動方案》，積極穩就業、促增收、減負擔，提升居民消費能力，大力增加優質消費供給，持續釋放消費潛力，不斷優化消費環境，增強消費意願，促進國民經濟持續向好發展。

Person of interest in custody in attack against 2 Jewish students at DePaul University,"Person of interest in custody in attack against 2 Jewish students at DePaul University
Chicago police did not provide additional details about the arrest. The attack happened on Nov. 6 outside the DePaul student center in the 2200 block of North Sheffield Avenue in Lincoln Park.
A person of interest is in custody in an attack last November against two Jewish students at DePaul University.
Chicago police did not provide additional details about the arrest. The attack happened on Nov. 6 outside the DePaul student center in the 2200 block of North Sheffield Avenue in Lincoln Park.
Max Long and Michael Kaminsky were outside the student center when they were approached and attacked by two men wearing black face masks, according to Chicago police. The incident was being investigated as a hate crime.
Long and Kaminsky filed a lawsuit against DePaul earlier this month, alleging the university was negligent and failed to protect their safety while on campus.
Long suffered a concussion, and Kaminsky fractured his wrist during the attack, the complaint says. A DePaul Public Safety officer was also present but failed to intervene, according to the lawsuit.
“Jewish students should feel safe on their own campus,” Kaminsky said at a news conference announcing the suit. “When universities infringe upon these rights, accountability must be demanded.”
The university has condemned the attack, saying “such an act clearly defies DePaul’s values to uphold and care for the dignity of every individual.”
The attack took place several months after pro-Palestinian students erected an encampment on DePaul’s campus, following a national trend that saw students call for an end to the Israeli bombardment of Gaza in the wake of the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attacks in Israel.
The Trump administration has targeted students who had been involved with pro-Palestinian activism or speech, with a few high-profile detentions of students including Mahmoud Khalil, a green card holder who was a leader of protests at Columbia University in New York.
But schools are also seeing visas stripped from students with no known connection to protests. In some cases, past infractions such as traffic violations have been cited. Some colleges say the reasons remain unclear to them — and they are seeking answers.

Peso mexicano gana terreno frente al dólar y BMV hila tres sesiones con ganancias,"El peso mexicano y la Bolsa Mexicana de Valores concluyeron la jornada de este miércoles 16 de abril con avances, favorecidos por un debilitamiento general del dólar y señales de prudencia por parte del presidente de la Reserva Federal de Estados Unidos, Jerome Powell, respecto a futuras decisiones sobre tasas de interés .
Publicidad El tipo de cambio cerró la sesión en 19.96 pesos por dólar, lo que representó una ganancia de 0.80% respecto al cierre del martes, de acuerdo con datos del Banco de México.
Analistas de Monex señalaron que la divisa mexicana se benefició de la caída del dólar ante los renovados temores de guerra comercial entre Estados Unidos y China, y anticiparon que el peso podría fluctuar entre 19.84 y 20.14 por dólar en operaciones overnight, tomando en cuenta que en México no habrá actividad financiera hasta el lunes por el asueto de Semana Santa.
Las advertencias de Powell
Durante un discurso en el Club Económico de Chicago, Powell advirtió sobre una coyuntura compleja para el banco central estadounidense, con presiones inflacionarias derivadas de los aranceles y, al mismo tiempo, signos de debilidad en el crecimiento económico y el empleo. Estos comentarios alimentaron la expectativa de que la Fed no apresurará cambios en su política monetaria.
Los inversionistas también se vieron alentados por un sólido reporte del Producto Interno Bruto (PIB) de China en el primer trimestre, pese a las tensiones comerciales con Washington. Además, las ventas minoristas en Estados Unidos crecieron por encima de lo esperado en marzo, lo que ayudó a mejorar el apetito por activos de riesgo.
Bolsa Mexicana de Valores hila tres sesiones al alza
El índice referencial S&P/BMV IPC avanzó 0.71% para ubicarse en 53,018.57 puntos, con un volumen de 168.2 millones de acciones negociadas, cifra menor al promedio diario reciente de 200 millones debido al periodo vacacional. Fue la tercera sesión consecutiva de ganancias para la plaza bursátil.
Entre los mayores ganadores del día estuvieron Industrias Peñoles, con un alza de 7.85%, y Grupo BMV, con un avance de 3.90%.
Fitch mantiene calificación de México
En el ámbito local, destacó que la agencia Fitch Ratings reiteró la calificación crediticia de México en “BBB-” con perspectiva estable, lo que contribuyó a sostener la confianza de los inversionistas.

Putin elogia Musk e o compara ao pai do programa espacial soviético - Folha PE,"Putin elogia Musk e o compara ao pai do programa espacial soviético
O líder russo comparou Musk a Sergei Korolev, que desenvolveu o primeiro satélite, o Sputnik
Vladimir Putin - declarações acontecem em um momento de aproximação entre a Rússia e os Estados Unidos - Foto: Mikhail Metzel/POOL/AFP
O presidente russo, Vladimir Putin, elogiou nesta quarta-feira (16) o bilionário norte-americano Elon Musk e o comparou ao lendário engenheiro de foguetes soviético Sergei Korolev.
Suas declarações acontecem em um momento de aproximação entre a Rússia e os Estados Unidos sob a administração do presidente Donald Trump, da qual Musk é uma figura-chave.
""Vocês sabem, há um homem — mora nos Estados Unidos — Musk, que se poderia dizer está entusiasmado com Marte"", disse Putin a estudantes durante uma visita à Universidade Bauman, um centro em Moscou especializado em ciência e engenharia.
""Esse é o tipo de pessoa que raramente aparece entre os seres humanos, movida por uma ideia específica. Embora hoje isso pareça inacreditável, esse tipo de ideia muitas vezes dá frutos com o tempo"", acrescentou.
O líder russo comparou Musk a Sergei Korolev (1907–1966), o pai do programa espacial soviético e herói nacional russo, que desenvolveu o primeiro satélite, o Sputnik, assim como a Vostok 1, que colocou em órbita o primeiro cosmonauta, Yuri Gagarin, em 1961.
""Assim como as ideias de Korolev, de nossos pioneiros, chegaram no tempo certo"", declarou Putin.
Elon Musk, o homem mais rico do mundo e o conselheiro mais influente de Trump, é o fundador da SpaceX, uma empresa americana que lança foguetes para a Nasa e é proprietária da rede de internet via satélite Starlink.
O bilionário tem criticado com frequência a Ucrânia, que enfrenta uma ofensiva russa há três anos.
No mês passado, Musk acusou o presidente ucraniano, Volodimir Zelensky, de querer uma ""guerra eterna"" e, em fevereiro, afirmou que Kiev havia ido ""longe demais"" no conflito.",2025-04-17T00:03:00.000+03:00,https://www.folhape.com.br/noticias/putin-elogia-musk-e-o-compara-ao-pai-do-programa-espacial-sovietico/405187,,positive

US approves sale of training choppers to PH,"ADDED ASSET The Philippine military plans to procure at least 10 TH-73A helicopters from the United States (one photographed here on Aug. 6, 2021, in Milton, Florida), according to Manila’s top envoy to Washington. —US Navy photo
MANILA, Philippines — After approving the sale of 20 F-16 fighter jets to the Philippines, the US Department of State has approved the sale of an unspecified number of training helicopters to Manila worth $120 million, which could be an added boost to the military’s assets in the face of growing tensions in the region.
In a statement on Wednesday, the US Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) said the approval came after the Philippines requested to buy from the US TH-73A training helicopters.
Article continues after this advertisement The DSCA and Manila have not disclosed how many helicopters the Armed Forces of the Philippines wanted to acquire.
A US state department officer informed the Inquirer in an email that the government is considering buying “up to six” training helicopters. Manila’s envoy to Washington, Ambassador Jose Manuel Romualdez, told the Inquirer that the plan was to procure “at least 10” of them.
READ: US approves sale of 20 F-16 fighter jets worth $5.5 billion to PH
The AFP had also requested to purchase aircraft simulators, spare engines, pack-up kits, fuel tanks, aircraft hoists and lifts, commercial avionics, and commercial flight management systems.
The DSCA said Congress had been notified of the approval of the possible Foreign Military Sales (FMS) of training helicopters to the Philippines, the United States’ oldest treaty and military ally in the region.
Article continues after this advertisement Funding options Under the US FMS, a country “may purchase or receive US-made defense articles and services either with their own funds or with funds provided through US government-sponsored assistance programs.”
In certain cases, defense equipment may be obtained through grants or leases, according to the DSCA.
Article continues after this advertisement It said that the principal contractor of the training helicopters would be the AgustaWestland Philadelphia Corporation in Philadelphia (Leonardo).
The proposed sale followed two weeks after the US approved the sale of F-16 aircraft to the Philippines for an estimated cost of $5.58 billion (or P319 billion).
It also came after US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth visit to the Philippines on March 28, where he renewed Washington’s “ironclad commitment” to Manila’s defense.
The DSCA said the proposed sale would support the foreign policy and national security of the United States by “helping to improve the security of a strategic partner that continues to be an important force for political stability, peace, and economic progress in Southeast Asia.”
Beijing, which has a long-standing maritime dispute with Manila over the West Philippine Sea, has warned the Philippines against threatening “regional peace” after the United States approved the sale of F-16 fighter jets.
Procurement plan “The Philippines’ defense and security cooperation with other countries should not target any third party or harm the interests of a third party. Nor should it threaten regional peace and security or exacerbate regional tensions,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said earlier this month.
Earlier, AFP chief Gen. Romeo Brawner Jr. said the military would procure more assets for the military, including missile systems, warships, and multi-role fighter jets, “to build a strong and reliable deterrent force.”
In 2024, President Marcos approved the military’s revised wish list for its “Re-Horizon 3,” the last stage in the AFP modernization program.
The new procurement plan would have a timeline of 10 years and is expected to cost about P2 trillion.

Navigation through Suez Canal sees improvement in March: canal chief-Xinhua,"ISMAILIA, Egypt, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Suez Canal Authority (SCA) Chairman Osama Rabie said on Wednesday there is a slight improvement in navigation through the canal during March.
The number of ships passing through the canal in March increased by 2.4 percent compared to January, Rabie announced during a ceremony in Ismailia Governorate in northeast Egypt, celebrating the achievements made by the canal over the past few years.
He added that the waterway recorded an 8.8 percent increase in revenues compared to January.
The SCA chief also noted that 264 ships adjusted their routes to pass through the Suez Canal instead of the Cape of Good Hope since the beginning of February.
""The United States is currently attacking the Houthis in Yemen, and it remains unclear whether these U.S. attacks have weakened the Houthis' ability to target shipping in the Red Sea,"" Rabie told Xinhua.
Egypt, which relies heavily on revenue from the Suez Canal, has repeatedly called for calm following a series of attacks on commercial vessels in the Red Sea.
In March, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi said that due to the regional turmoil -- including attacks on vessels in the Red Sea by Yemen's Houthis -- the Suez Canal was losing approximately 800 million U.S. dollars in revenue each month.
The U.S. military has resumed airstrikes on Houthi-held areas in northern Yemen since March 15 in a bid to deter the group from attacking Israeli targets, the U.S. Navy, and international shipping lanes in the region.
However, the Houthi group responded by affirming its unwavering support for Gaza. It has resumed attacks on Israeli targets and U.S. military vessels in the Red Sea, as Israel ended a January ceasefire with Hamas and restarted military operations in Gaza. ■",2025-04-17T00:37:00.000+03:00,https://english.news.cn/20250417/d1ff9654d54a48aaaa19333127a7a5b7/c.html,Xinhua,positive

General Assembly Passes State's $59.8 Billion Budget - Chattanoogan.com,"The Tennessee House and Senate on Wednesday passed the state’s $59.8 billion budget for the 2025-26 fiscal year, fulfilling the General Assembly’s only constitutional duty.
Officials said, ""This year’s spending plan, which recognizes a two percent growth rate, ""reaffirms the General Assembly’s commitment to conservative budgeting, while prioritizing the needs of Tennesseans across the state. The balanced budget advances the state’s efforts to improve public safety, invest in infrastructure, advance education, support rural healthcare, and increase disaster relief funding for Hurricane Helene recovery.
""The legislative amendment makes fiscally responsible adjustments to the administration’s initial budget proposal by shifting $19.94 million in recurring allocations to non-recurring, allowing the state to better manage long-term spending obligations.
""Additionally, the General Assembly repurposed funds for legislative initiatives to support critical community needs, while maintaining Governor Lee’s major priorities.""
The administration gave this assessment of the budget:
Grant Pool for Critical Community Services
In the 2025-26 budget, the General Assembly created a $42.5 million grant pool, with nonrecurring funds, for important emergency and community services. The grants include:
Disaster Relief for Hurricane Helene
The General Assembly continued to support victims of Hurricane Helene by providing $26 million nonrecurring for disaster relief for Helene victims in Northeast Tennessee and $20 million nonrecurring for local match funds for FEMA disaster relief.
Rural Hospital Support and Healthcare Investments
Lawmakers made significant investments in hospitals by using TennCare Shared Savings to provide an additional $78 million to help hospitals, particularly in rural areas, with uncompensated care and $4 million to complete capital projects at county health departments.
Additional healthcare investments include:
Safety and Security Improvements
The Legislative amendment also provides additional allocations in safety and security:
Major investments secured
In addition to the adjustments made to fund legislative priorities, the budget maintains important investments proposed by Governor Lee including:
Expanding choices for parents
In the January special session, the General Assembly passed historic legislation to provide Education Freedom Scholarships to empower parents with the freedom to pick the right school for their child and have a say in where their tax dollars are spent – regardless of income or zip code. This school choice initiative invests $145.9 million in Education Freedom Scholarships.
Statements from Legislative Leadership
Senate Finance, Ways and Means Chairman Bo Watson (R-Hixson):
“With revenues at more typical levels after years of historic growth, this budget reflects the careful discipline needed to protect Tennessee's financial future. We’ve kept recurring spending in check and preserved low taxes, while supporting critical community services and investing in rural hospitals that serve some of our most vulnerable populations. Tennessee is a shining example of fiscal conservatism, and this budget reflects that lasting commitment.”
House Finance, Ways and Means Chairman Gary Hicks (R-Rogersville):
“Our focus is on lasting financial strength and stability for the Volunteer State. This budget reaffirms our commitment to Tennesseans to keep our state on a conservative path to greater prosperity. We have tightened our belts, kept government spending low, and addressed a diverse range of needs, benefiting all Tennesseans.”
Lt. Governor Randy McNally (R-Oak Ridge):
“Tennessee's strong and historical commitment to fiscal responsibility continues to serve taxpayers well. Despite slow revenue growth and a national economy in reset, Tennessee is investing in education, cutting spending and making strong commitments to public safety. We are also redoubling our support for infrastructure by allocating additional money for our roads. While other states struggle to stay afloat financially, we are operating with little debt and our rainy day fund remains at historic levels. Once again, Tennessee is leading the nation in fiscally responsible, conservative budgeting.”
House Speaker Cameron Sexton (R-Crossville):
“This budget reflects Tennessee’s strong commitment to responsible leadership and forward-thinking investment. We’re addressing core priorities like education, public safety, and transportation while maintaining our conservative fiscal principles. It’s a budget that balances our needs today with a vision for tomorrow.”
Senate Majority Leader Jack Johnson (R-Franklin):
“This budget prioritizes critical investments for Tennesseans, keeps our state financially secure, and advances us toward a prosperous future. It continues our commitment to education and infrastructure, while also streamlining government operations and eliminating hundreds of vacant positions to protect taxpayer dollars. I commend Governor Lee and my colleagues in the General Assembly for their work to craft a budget that meets the needs of our citizens and upholds Tennessee’s legacy of fiscal responsibility.”
House Majority Leader William Lamberth (R-Portland):
“This is a spending plan that serves all citizens by prioritizing investments in education, strengthening public safety, maximizing our infrastructure and ensuring Tennessee remains one of the lowest-taxed states in the nation. I am proud of the collaborative work by members in both chambers to balance our budget needs of today with our obligation to future generations. Tennessee is on solid financial footing.”

　　4月15日是全民國家安全教育日，香港特區維護國家安全委員會舉辦了「全民國家安全教育日」開幕典禮暨主題講座。42名參加了第二屆「國家安全教育參訪團」的本港中小學生，以前往北京及上海參訪交流的經歷為背景，表演了舞台情景短劇《學子心 祖國情》。
　　六名參演學生接受大公報記者訪問，分享參訪團所見所感，以及台前幕後的趣事，表達了香港年輕一代對國家發展的正面認知和主動維護國家安全的堅定決心。\大公報記者 陸九如（文） 麥潤田（圖） 融媒組（視頻）
　　「參加國家安全參訪團令我對國家近代史產生了更全面的認識。」就讀港島民生書院的陳卓謙表示，赴內地學習的行程涵蓋很多地方，以往從沒經歷過。他參加了國安宣講會，還看到天安門廣場升旗儀式。陳卓謙在中國共產黨歷史展覽館看到許多傳奇人物的事跡，讓他了解到新中國成立時，千千萬萬先輩所作出的努力和犧牲，「這樣的精神值得香港年輕人學習。」作為首次參演短劇的同學，陳卓謙指開闊了視野，未來會從自己做起，並將體驗和經驗分享給同學，幫助大家培養國家安全的意識和國民身份認同。
　　敬仰錢學森無私奉獻精神
　　就讀福建中學高二年級的胡聞韜十分珍惜去人民大會堂參觀，在觀禮台上看升旗儀式的寶貴經驗。「我認為黨史館將歷史的厚重感和現代的科技感完美結合，通過多媒體互動，將黨和國家的發展脈絡呈現給同學們。」胡聞韜在短劇中飾演錢學森一角。被問到如何呈現「中國航天之父」這一重要角色時，他表示通過了解錢學森生平，觀看紀錄片和媒體介紹等，深入理解錢學森排除萬難，毅然決然回國發展航天事業的心路歷程。「錢老的事跡完美體現了熱愛祖國、無私奉獻的兩彈一星精神。」胡聞韜還指，錢學森曾說：「外國人可以做的，怎麼中國人就不行。」這讓他明白只要下定決心，毅然走下去，就一定會成功。
　　瑪利諾修院學校（中學部）許雅妍分享，行程中觀看升旗禮，清楚地看到三軍儀仗隊的英姿，看到全場莊嚴肅立唱國歌，一股愛國情懷油然而生。「我覺得自己對國家安全肩負了更大的使命。」許雅妍說，她在參訪團後還報名參加青年國安大使的培訓計劃，「希望有機會去做國安展覽館的義務導賞員。」許雅妍透露，參訪團後對基本法、憲法、國家安全法等法律產生濃厚興趣，希望未來能成為一名律師。「台上一分鐘，台下十年功。」許雅妍分享說，本次短劇表演提高團隊凝聚力、自信心和溝通能力。
　　朱晁陞就讀於聖公會李兆強小學，首次到訪北京，首都的繁華留下非常深刻印象。在行程中，他最難忘參觀清華大學，「那裏的大哥哥大姐姐都很厲害，而且很謙虛」，令他萌生日後去該校讀書的想法。他亦對國家航天發展很感興趣，希望日後從事守護國家安全、回饋社會的職業。他說，許多同學首次參加話劇，綵排過程中發生很多趣事，「這是大家值得一起學習的寶貴經驗。」
　　 現今安穩生活 先輩用生命鑄造
　　就讀於順德聯誼總會胡少渠紀念小學的邵梓謙，在劇中飾演與小紅軍對話的小學生，他認為現今人們安穩生活是先輩們用自己的生命鑄造的，所以更應該珍惜。此次參訪團令他印象最深刻的是參觀中關村第三小學的校園，以及和當地的同學進行交流。
　　在劇中飾演其中一位小紅軍的是來自中華傳道會安柱中學的張浩榮，他告訴記者，平時比較開朗，但扮演小紅軍需保持嚴肅。「紅軍長征是中國共產黨歷史上一項偉大的壯舉，他們為人民的幸福不惜自我犧牲的精神令人動容。」他過往認為，只要國家不被侵犯，自身利益無損，就算國家安全。但在參訪團結束後，他知道國家安全包括許多範疇，與人民生活息息相關，國家的穩定需要共同維護。張浩榮說，參觀航天城讓他了解到國家最新的科技發展，認識到包括導航系統、國防在內的航天科技是國家安全的重要組成部分，他認為新時代的年輕人，應積極為祖國的科技事業貢獻力量。",2025-04-17T00:01:00.000+03:00,http://www.takungpao.com.hk/news/232109/2025/0417/1078626.html,大公报,positive

State workers make case for remote work in Texas House hearing,"AUSTIN __ State employees asked Texas House lawmakers Wednesday for more flexibility to work from home as agencies enact stricter rules for the state’s nearly 150,000 workers following a March order by Republican Gov.

"Vista Energy compra la participación de Petronas en Argentina por US$ 1,500 millones | ECONOMIA | GESTIÓN","Vista Energy, el segundo mayor productor de crudo en la floreciente formación de shale de Vaca Muerta en Argentina, adquirió la participación del 50% de Petronas en un yacimiento petrolífero de la zona.
La adquisición de la participación, denominada La Amarga Chica, tiene un valor aproximado de US$ 1,500 millones. Vista pagará US$ 900 millones en efectivo ahora, de los cuales US$ 300 millones se financiarán con un préstamo bancario de Banco Santander SA.
Petronas también recibirá una participación de aproximadamente el 7% en Vista, por un valor aproximado de US$ 300 millones. Vista pagará otros US$ 300 millones en dos cuotas en 2029 y 2030.
El acuerdo prácticamente consolida la salida de Argentina de la empresa malaya Petronas, después de que también se retirara de un proyecto de gas natural licuado con la estatal YPF S.A.
También es otra señal de que la explotación de Vaca Muerta estará cada vez más encabezada por empresa locales, en lugar de multinacionales: Exxon Mobil Corp. vendió su portafolio de shale oil argentino el año pasado y TotalEnergies SE busca hacer lo mismo.
YPF, propietaria del otro 50% de La Amarga Chica, seguirá siendo el operador.
Los accionistas de Vista —fundada por Miguel Galuccio, miembro de la junta directiva de SLB, que atrajo a Petronas al yacimiento hace una década cuando dirigía YPF— dieron luz verde el mes pasado a la dirección para que llevara a cabo una adquisición y la financiara con deuda o con la venta de acciones.
Vista se está expandiendo en un momento incierto para la industria petrolera mundial, ya que los precios caen en medio de la guerra comercial de Donald Trump. Galuccio advirtió hace varias semanas que la dirección consideraría recortes presupuestarios si el crudo ligero Medanito producido en Vaca Muerta, que sigue de cerca al Brent, cae por debajo de los US$ 55.
Pero también hay vientos de cola para el shale argentino, luego de que el presidente Javier Milei flexibilizara esta semana los controles de cambio que durante mucho tiempo han reprimido el crecimiento y se llevan adelante expansiones de oleoductos.
El acuerdo proporcionará un rápido crecimiento a Vista. Antes de la adquisición, había fijado como objetivo una producción diaria de hasta 100,000 barriles este año, un aumento con respecto a los 70,000 de 2024, a través de un plan para invertir más de US$ 1,000 millones. Con La Amarga Chica, obtiene inmediatamente un aumento de 40,000 barriles y tendrá que incrementar sus gastos de capital.",2025-04-17T00:56:00.000+03:00,https://gestion.pe/economia/empresas/vista-energy-compra-la-participacion-de-petronas-en-argentina-por-us-1500-millones-noticia,Redacción Gestión,positive

Senate committee approves plan to sell ready-to-drink cocktails in Alabama grocery stores,"Alabama took another step toward allowing ready-to-drink cocktails on grocery and convenience store shelves Wednesday, as the Senate Tourism Committee advanced a bill establishing a framework for their sale and distribution.
SB268 , sponsored by State Sen. Bobby Singleton (D-Greensboro) received a favorable report following brief discussion and the adoption of a small amendment. The bill defines a new category of “mixed spirit beverages” — single-serve cocktails containing no more than 7% alcohol by volume — and would allow them to be sold outside ABC stores through a newly created licensing structure.
The adopted amendment changed the taxation rate on mixed spirit beverages to 3.5 cents per ounce, which amounts to approximately 42 cents for a standard 12-ounce can.
RELATED: Alabama closer than ever to allowing ready-to-drink spirits on grocery store shelves
Under the bill, suppliers would be required to designate exclusive sales territories and enter into distribution agreements with licensed wholesalers. A new excise tax would be levied on RTD sales, split between the state’s general fund and the Alcoholic Beverage Control (ABC) Board for regulatory and enforcement purposes.
State Sen. Rodger Smitherman (D-Birmingham) raised concerns about potential revenue impacts to the ABC Board. “This, in essence, is going to diminish their ability to provide that level of revenue for the state,” one senator said. “Now I realize… it’s speculative until we see the performance of what takes place.”
Despite reservations, Smitherman added that he was “taking a chance” on the legislation and its impacts on revenue.
The bill now heads to the full Senate for consideration. If passed into law, it would mark a significant shift in Alabama’s alcohol sales policy, opening the door for canned cocktails and similar products to be sold alongside beer and wine in retail stores beginning October 1, 2025.

SEN. JONES' BILL TO END ELDERLY PAROLE FOR VIOLENT SEX OFFENDERS PASSES KEY SENATE COMMITTEE,"Printer-friendly version
East County News Service

April 16, 2025 (Sacramento, CA) -- In February, Senate Minority Leader Brian W. Jones (R-San Diego) introduced Senate Bill 286, to close what he called a “dangerous loophole” in California’s Elderly Parole program that allows violent sex offenders and murderers as young as age 50 to be released early.
Authored by Jones, and coauthored by
Assemblymember Stephanie Nguyen(D-Elk Grove), the Senate Public Safety Committee earlier this month unanimously approved the bipartisan SB 286, also known as Mary Bella’s Law, to close that loophole.“Releasing violent rapists under the so-called ‘elderly parole’ is not only an insult to victims but a grave danger to Californians,” Jones stated in a press release.. “Survivors of violent sex crimes and the families of murder victims should never have to live in fear that their attacker could walk free long before serving their full sentence.
""But under current law, the system is rigged in favor of criminals, forcing the Board of Parole Hearings to justify why these offenders shouldn’t be released. That’s completely backward. The law should protect law-abiding Californians, not violent criminals.”
Before the bill hearing, Leader Jones held a press conference with
San Diego District Attorney Summer Stephan, Sen. Suzette Martinez Valladares(R-Santa Clarita), Auburn-California headquarteredCrime Victims United, and more than 40 victims and victim advocates including: Colleen Stan, known as the ""Girl in the Box"" from the Lifetime Movie, survivor of Cameron Hooker of Red Bluff, CA; Mary Johnson, survivor of Cody Klemp of Moreno Valley, CA; Claira Stansbury speaking on behalf of her sister Bella Clark, survivor of Charles Mix of Riverside, CA; and, Johanna Call, survivor of Michael Dausey of Shasta County, CA.The current Elderly Parole program was quietly expanded through a last-minute, gut-and-amend budget bill,
Assembly Bill 3234 (Ting – 2020), which lowered the age threshold for elderly parole from 60 years of age to 50 years of age. A loophole in that bill allows violent sex offenders to be eligible for elderly parole after serving only 20 years.Despite its major societal and fiscal impacts, AB 3234 was rushed through the process without a single Senate policy committee hearing. Proponents of the measure vowed that sex offenders and rapists would not be eligible for Elderly Parole, but ‘""accidentally"" left out that key protection — and have refused to fix their mistake.
Since its passage, multiple rapists and child molesters have become eligible for Elderly Parole, forcing victims and their families to relive their trauma as they fight to keep their perpetrators behind bars.
Mary Bella’s Law will finally correct this dangerous loophole, ensuring that rapists and child molesters aren’t eligible for Elderly Parole. A petition in support of SB 286 has garnered almost 700 signatures statewide.
“I’m grateful to the Senate Public Safety Committee for advancing this commonsense, bipartisan measure and putting victims first. Today’s bill passage is a win for public safety and a message to crime victims that they have not been forgotten,” Jones said.
SB 286 was the second attempt by Jones to close this loophole for rapists in the Elderly Parole program. His previous bill,",2025-04-17T00:46:00.000+03:00,http://www.eastcountymagazine.org/sen-jones-bill-end-elderly-parole-violent-sex-offenders-passes-key-senate-committee,Karen Pearlman,positive

Thai authorities crackdown on Indian call center gang in Thailand,"Thai authorities crackdown on Indian call center gang in Thailand
PATTAYA, THAILAND – In a decisive operation, the Immigration Bureau’s Investigations Division (Immigration Division 3), in collaboration with local officials in Sriracha District, dismantled an Indian call center gang operating out of rented pool villas in Chonburi province.
The gang was accused of scamming fellow Indian nationals into online gambling schemes, Pattaya Mail reported.
Raid uncovers scamming operation in sriracha
Led by Colonel Jiraphong Rujiradamrongchai, Chief of the Investigation Division at Immigration Division 3, authorities arrested eight individuals, one man and seven women, during the raid.
Evidence seized included laptops, Wi-Fi routers, mobile phones, Indian SIM cards, CCTV cameras, passports, and cash totaling Rs 50,000 (US$583.47)
Investigations revealed that the gang leader had rented three pool villas under a one-year contract with a monthly rental fee of 95,000 Baht (US$2,846.87). The suspects claimed to be working for a U.S.-based company while living together in the villas.
They reportedly scammed 10 to 20 individuals daily by luring them into online gambling schemes.
Several suspects arrested in connection with a call center scam in Thailand revealed they initially entered the country as tourists but were recruited into the operation after running out of money, with their roles typically lasting a month before being replaced by new recruits.
Authorities actions towards growing scam concerns
Law enforcement authorities actively work toward identifying further members of the gang followed by seeking appropriate legal consequences.
The government initiated these actions to stop call center scams because they lead to major financial losses and target defenseless people.
Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra leads the government efforts to suppress scams through electricity cutoffs and internet service interruptions.
As authorities intensify their efforts, operations like the Sriracha raid highlight the importance of vigilance against evolving scam tactics targeting unsuspecting victims worldwide.",2025-04-17T01:00:00.000+03:00,https://news.outsourceaccelerator.com/thai-authorities-crackdown-on-indian-call-center,Julliana Anne Briones,positive

QXO Announces $500 Million Stock Offering Amid Acquisition Plans,"- QXO aims to raise $500 million via a common stock offering.
- Funds will support the acquisition of Beacon Roofing Supply.
- Stock saw a 1.96% decrease post-announcement.
QXO's Strategic Capital Raising Initiative
In a recent financial maneuver, QXO (QXO, Financial) has revealed its intention to bolster its financial resources by raising $500 million through a common stock offering. This strategic move signals QXO's ambition to strengthen its market position by investing in growth opportunities.
Purpose Behind the Capital Raise
The primary objective of this capital infusion is to facilitate the acquisition of Beacon Roofing Supply. By increasing its stake in the building materials sector, QXO aims to expand its operational capabilities and enhance shareholder value.
Market Reaction to The Announcement
The announcement, however, came with immediate market consequences. QXO shares experienced a slight decline of 1.96%, settling at $13.98 in after-hours trading. This dip reflects the market's cautious sentiment towards the equity issuance, which could dilute existing share value in the short term.
Investor Considerations
For investors, the key takeaway is QXO's proactive approach to leveraging capital markets for growth. While the short-term stock dip might be concerning, the long-term strategic benefits of the acquisition could outweigh initial dilution impacts. Keeping a close eye on further developments will be crucial for evaluating QXO's future performance.",2025-04-17T01:11:04.983+03:00,https://www.gurufocus.com/news/2785330/qxo-announces-500-million-stock-offering-amid-acquisition-plans,@gurufocus,positive

N.B. signs free trade pact with Ontario,"N.B. signs free trade pact with Ontario
Premiers pledge to keep pushing other provinces to come up with similar agreements to reduce trade barriers within Canada
Article content
New Brunswick has signed a free trade agreement with Ontario, the biggest market in Canada with more than 16 million people, as uncertainty swells over U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariffs.
Premier Susan Holt and Ontario Premier Doug Ford – dubbed Captain Canada for taking on the belligerent president – signed the memorandum of understanding on Wednesday in Toronto to reduce trade and labour mobility barriers.
Nova Scotia Premier Tim Houston took part as well, inking a separate free trade agreement between his province and Ontario.
The goal is to move forward as quickly as possible and remove as many barriers as possible.
Susan Holt
But noticeably absent from the ceremony were the 10 other provincial and territorial premiers, all of whom have talked about the importance of showing unity in the face of Trump’s threats.
“It’s a great day for New Brunswick because New Brunswick entrepreneurs and businesses are now going to have free and clear access to a market of millions and millions of people in Ontario,” Holt said at a news conference on Wednesday after the signing ceremony.
“I’m excited about that. The goal is to move forward as quickly as possible and remove as many barriers as possible to trade across this country.”
Since taking office in November, the Republican president has launched a global trade war, spooking markets and raising fears of a widespread economic recession. He has already tariffed Canadian autos, aluminum and steel, and threatened even more punishing duties.
Trump’s repeated comments that he wants to turn Canada into his country’s 51st state has rankled Canadians and become the dominant issue in the lead up to the April 28 federal election.
The three leaders admitted they had work to do convincing other premiers to sign similar agreements. And it was odd to see Ford sign separate deals with New Brunswick and Nova Scotia but not the two neighbouring Maritime provinces sign agreements with each other.
Holt said she was confident the Atlantic provinces would hammer out a deal soon, noting that even Andrew Furey, the outgoing premier of Newfoundland and Labrador, is intent on signing an agreement before his successor is picked by Liberal Party members on May 3.
Quebec, which borders New Brunswick and is its biggest trading partner, poses one of the biggest barriers to free trade because its labour agreements protect the local workforce from others taking their jobs.
Quebec Premier François Legault has also been slow to smooth transportation bottlenecks, finishing the twinning of the TransCanada highway that runs through his province at a pace much slower than what the Canadian Chambers of Commerce had demanded.
The untwinned section, from Saint-Antonin to Saint-Louis-du-Ha! Ha! near New Brunswick is supposed to be converted to a divided, four-lane highway by the end of 2026 after years of delays.
Much was made at the press conference about how New Brunswick and Ontario would use the same transportation rules on everything from tire pressure, to safety vests, to first aid kits. The idea is to ensure transport trucks don’t need to swap out or change parts and equipment when they move across borders, lowering costs and making trade smoother and more seamless.
But, Quebec, with its own set of transportation rules, must be crossed first, a journey of hundreds of kilometres.
“I have started the conversation with Premier Legault to assess his willingness to get into this and really tackle some of the sticky labour mobility challenges that we’ve been facing between New Brunswick and Quebec for a long time,” Holt said.
“We also hope that Quebec agrees to change their transportation rules to recognize our drivers, and our vehicles, and our tire pressure and flags the same way we are prepared to recognize theirs.”
Canada has had free trade with the United States since 1989, when it entered into force, but interprovincial trade barriers remain.
You talk about tariffs, my goodness, we’ve been tariffing each other, it seems, for decades, generations.
Doug Ford
Ford said studies show that growth domestic product would rise between four and eight per cent with freer trade within Canada, adding $200 billion of economic activity.
“Across the country internal trade barriers increase the cost of everyday goods and services by nearly 15 per cent,” the Progressive Conservative premier said. “You talk about tariffs, my goodness, we’ve been tariffing each other, it seems, for decades, generations, actually.”
Ford said much like Trump’s tariffs, “these trade barriers hurt our economy, drive away jobs and investment, and divide us from each other. With President Trump taking direct aim at Canada’s economy, it can’t be business as usual.”
While most economists suggest free trade with the United States was good overall for Canada, there was upheaval along the way, with plant closures and job losses in certain sectors, especially when Canadians failed to compete.
Holt said she wasn’t worried that would happen to some New Brunswick businesses if they compete without barriers with Ontario.
With 16 million people in Ontario versus the fewer than 900,000 in New Brunswick, she argued “the balance is in our favour,” for homegrown products like Mrs. Dunster’s donuts and Petit-Sault beer.
And she said the $1.7-billion New Brunswick seafood industry could fill the plates of scores of Ontarians with more lobster, crab, red fish, oysters and mussels.
“I am not expecting that businesses will close because they can’t compete,” Holt said. “Our government has been very keen to work with New Brunswick entrepreneurs on their competitiveness, their productivity, their access to markets, their automation.
“And so, in partnership with the federal government, we’ve been encouraging businesses to get really lean and mean, and we’ve never had more interest from businesses that really want to seize this opportunity, with the threat the tariffs have imposed, to make investments.”
Although there was a lot of serious economic talk, there were moments of levity too.
Ontario is introducing legislation to ensure any other province that does not impose trade barriers to goods from Canada’s most populous province will receive the same free access for its own goods.
Ford, who’s noticeably wider than the slim and fit Houston, mentioned one of his favourite treats.
“You can tell this guy’s in shape,” he said gesturing toward Houston. “He hasn’t eaten too many pizzas like me, but anyways, I’ll go with the frozen pizza. The frozen pizza made in Nova Scotia will be automatically recognized as very safe to buy and eat here in Ontario. And to take that one step further, if the truck driver who’s moving those frozen pizzas is trained and certified in Nova Scotia, their credentials will automatically be recognized here.”
New Brunswick has already begun dismantling trade barriers with other provinces. Last month, the Liberal government introduced legislative amendments, aimed at improving labour mobility and reducing interprovincial obstacles.
Amendments to the Fair Registration Practices in Regulated Professions Act, when passed by the Liberal majority, would allow people in regulated professions to begin working immediately in their new jurisdiction during the registration process.
Amendments to the Liquor Control Act would allow New Brunswickers to participate in the direct-to-consumer sales of alcohol and erase personal exemption limits for alcohol. Previously, the New Brunswick government had fought all the way to the Supreme Court of Canada to retain the right to confiscate alcohol and fine New Brunswickers who brought in too much booze from Quebec or other provinces.

"New Bedford man killed in highway crash remembered as caring, supportive, with musical talent","A local man killed in a Wednesday highway crash is being remembered.
According to Massachusetts State Police, at approximately 11:20 a.m., the Dartmouth Barracks received a report of a three-car crash involving a tractor trailer on Interstate 195 West in the Town of Dartmouth. The caller indicated that one of the operators was not breathing and that person was declared dead at the scene by Dartmouth EMS.
The deceased operator was identified as Anthony Moniz, 62, of New Bedford.
Those who knew Moniz, like Jimmy James, described a supportive friend who was more than the musical talent that he possessed.
“I’ve known Tony for many years because of the music scene. Tony was that friend that you might not see all the time, but he’s always there, watching and cheering you on.

"法官扎根田间，""司法护农""有实招|法官_新浪财经_新浪网","□ 通讯员 魏良敏 李思宇
近年来，东海县人民法院房山人民法庭立足农林业集群乡情，提出“农家法庭 法润乡村”服务理念，为辖区群众站好“护农法治岗”，努力把矛盾化解在基层、化解在萌芽状态，在全面服务乡村振兴中展现“小法庭”的“大担当”。
农田改为鱼塘，
法院依法护耕地稳农基
永久基本农田经依法划定后，任何单位和个人不得擅自占用或改变其用途，这是我国耕地保护的一条红线。房山法庭通过依法裁判及判后延伸，坚决防止耕地“非农化”“非粮化”，努力让每一寸耕地都成为丰收的沃土。
承包农田，开挖鱼塘，变身“塘主”，乍一听是条致富的“好路子”，实际上却可能“踩”上法律红线。房山法庭在受理的一起土地纠纷案件中，王某从同村村民手中承包土地并进行特色农田改造，后将涉案土地转租给张某，张某联合其他两人合伙经营，在原本种植农作物的土地上，开挖鱼塘进行水产养殖，改变土地用途。王某多次与张某协商，要求张某将鱼塘恢复为农田，张某不予理睬。经当地村镇多次组织调解无果，王某将张某诉至法庭。
时值春耕时节，承办法官了解案情后，决定上门巡回审理，化解双方纠纷。房山法庭现场告知私挖鱼塘村民破坏基本农田是违法行为，要求其立即整改，恢复土地原貌。在法官的释法说理下，张某认识到自己错误，同意将土地恢复原状，双方握手言和。
房山法庭坚持能动司法、绿色发展、系统保护、最严法治、协同共治理念，建立耕地纠纷多元化解机制，采取“属地化解”模式将案件分配至对应乡镇，聘请乡镇政府、司法所等工作人员担任调解专员，提供绿色通道就地解决土地纠纷。以司法助力“坚决遏制耕地‘非农化’、严格管控耕地‘非粮化’”，加强涉耕地非诉执行案件审查，审慎采取耕地查封等措施，助力政府依法收回耕地、盘活资源，与政府相关部门探索建立闭环“保护圈”。充分发挥司法的规则引领和价值导向功能，引导全社会不断提升农用地保护法治意识，为保护土地资源安全、粮食安全提供更加有力的司法服务和保障。
一次有效调解，
让案件从“两难”到“双赢”
“吴法官，我们村土地流转遇到了问题，3600多亩土地面临抛荒，很棘手啊，请法庭帮帮我们。”2023年5月初，陆圩村党支部徐书记心急如焚地来到房山法庭。
由于村集体的3600多亩土地发包给某农业公司，承包期限5年，到第3年，小麦正值收割之时，由于该公司经营不善，管理能力有限，同时在发包土地之时，双方未能准确测量承包面积亩数并交接，某农业公司要求解除土地承包经营合同，并明确表示即使不同意解除，该公司也不会再继续栽种夏季水稻和支付土地承包金。如果该公司不继续履行合同和交纳支付土地承包金，陆圩村委会就无力向老百姓支付流转土地租金，3600多亩土地也面临抛荒，损失巨大，影响恶劣。
房山法庭立即开展诉前调解，与乡镇党委政府齐发力，向双方详细讲解农村土地承包法的相关规定，从“法理情”等多方面入手，做双方思想工作。最终，经过承办法官释法明理和耐心调解，双方逐渐放下芥蒂。某农业公司同意将小麦等农作物收割完，便于村委会安排下茬耕作。本来是两难的一起案件，如若不及时解决问题，农民和农业公司的利益都会损失惨重，在法庭调解下最终迎来转机，解了燃眉之急。
土地是农业的根本，维护土地安全，保护土地正常运行，是关系农业发展、农民幸福的大事。房山法庭积极加强与村镇党委、人大代表、政协委员的沟通交流，促进与司法所、派出所、矛调中心等组织的对接，主动融入社会治理大格局，通过“巡回审判+多元解纷+科技赋能”等模式，将司法服务延伸到农家院落、田间地头，让群众切实感受到公平正义就在身边，为乡村振兴注入法治暖流。
今年以来，房山法庭还在辖区内积极推进融合法庭，对接基层司法、行政及社会力量，构建预防、排查、化解链条式解纷体系，凝聚前端纠纷预防化解合力，推动更多苗头性纠纷、批量性纠纷化解在当地。
深耕法治沃土，
“一线体验”激活普法新维度
“邀请我们参加这个庭审非常好，让大家知法懂法，才能更好解决问题，希望法官以后经常到田间地头给大家普法。”房山法庭积极组织辖区内村镇干部、种田大户、人民调解员、网格员等群体走进法庭，现场观摩一起典型的土地纠纷案件庭审。庭后，大家座谈交流，通过面对面的互动沟通，不仅能直接了解各村面临的同类纠纷，集思广益，提建议、想办法、解矛盾，还能提升与会人员的专业素养，促进土地流转的规范化、法治化。
不仅要“请进来”，还要“走出去”。近日，房山法庭把“农家小法庭”搬到田间地头，通过巡回开庭的形式成功审结一起土地承包经营权纠纷案。村干部、人民调解员、群众等20余人现场旁听庭审。通过法官、人民调解员、村干部一个多小时的调解，被告同意支付欠付原告李某的土地承包费1.5万元，双方签署调解协议，该纠纷得以圆满化解。法官还结合本案例，用通俗易懂的语言向村民们讲解签订土地流转合同应注意的问题，对民法典中规定的土地承包经营权等法律法规及法律常识进行讲解。
房山法庭还成立“助耕普法小分队”，组织法庭干警走访种植大户、家庭农场，针对农户农业生产过程中遇到的困难和法律需求，通过按需送法，为农民答疑解惑。同时，利用当地群众赶集节点，开展“法治赶大集”活动，通过多角度、全方位、深层次的普法活动，不仅帮助农民解决农业生产方面的法律问题，还通过普法教育提升其风险防范能力，从源头减少纠纷，维护农村社会稳定，为粮食安全提供司法保障，有效推动乡村法治化建设进程。",2025-04-17T01:03:00.000+03:00,https://finance.sina.com.cn/jjxw/2025-04-17/doc-inetmkha6204170.shtml,sina.com.cn,positive

"First Pacific Islander installed Archbishop of Nouméa, Wallis-and-Futuna, and Vanuatu","Monsignor Susitino Sionepoe, from Wallis-and Futuna, was officially installed on Saturday as the new Archbishop of Nouméa, Wallis-and-Futuna, and Vanuatu.
He is the first Pacific Islander to access this key position, which had been held by 81-year-old Monsignor Michel-Marie Calvet since 1981.
Monsignor Sionepoe's inaugural mass was held in the Saint Joseph Cathedral of Nouméa, in presence of thousands of Catholics, some of them coming from as far as New Zealand, where Wellington-based Mgr Gábor Pinter, the Nuncio of the Vatican, is based for the whole region.
Eleven bishops from the region, including Guam, Papeete, Port Vila, Kiribati and Wallis-et-Futuna, were also in attendance.
Officials from New Caledonia also included French High Commissioner Louis Le Franc, Senator Georges Naturel, Congress President Veylma Falaeo, Southern Province President Sonia Backès, the mayors of Nouméa Mayor (Sonia Lagarde), Mont-Dore (Eddie Lecourieux) and Dumbéa (Yoann Lecourieux) and pro-independence leader Roch Wamytan.
During his inaugural homily, the new archbishop appealed to all Catholics, especially in New Caledonia, to remain ""artisan of peace"".
Catholicism is a major religious denomination in New Caledonia, with a 182-year history in the French Pacific territory.
In the weeks following destructive riots that broke out on 13 May 2024, several Catholic missions throughout New Caledonia were targeted by arson and largely destroyed.
As he was officially and liturgically intronised and ushered into the Cathedral, 60-year-old Mgr Sionepoe, who was elevated to the position by Pope Francis on 15 January 2025, was surrounded by conches and drums from Lifou Island, as well as traditional singing and dancing from his native islands of Wallis-et-Futuna.
The ceremony was also attended by over six hundred Catholics outside the Cathedral on a giant screen.
Back in Wallis-and-Futuna, the live broadcast was followed by thousands.
Monsignor Sionepoe, from Wallis-and-Futuna, was ordained priest in 1993 and became Bishop of Wallis in 1998.
During his career, he has also served in Tonga, in the North of New Caledonia and Fiji.",2025-04-17T00:04:00.000+03:00,https://www.rnz.co.nz/international/pacific-news/558417/first-pacific-islander-installed-archbishop-of-noumea-wallis-and-futuna-and-vanuatu,@RNZInews,positive

核心提示
在锦州市黑山县，一场轰轰烈烈的产业转型升级大戏正在上演。黑山县锚定新能源与高端制造“双赛道”，紧抓庞河经济开发区获批国家“十四五”时期重点支持的产业转型升级示范园区契机，以“壮士断腕”的决心，推动传统工业升级换代；洞悉锦州建设百万千瓦级清洁能源大基地带动上下游协同发展红利，运用“链式思维”重塑产业布局；既充分发挥自身优势，大力发展绿色能源产业，又敢于突破常规，积极布局高端制造业。在这场工业变革的浪潮中，黑山县正以破立并举的姿态，提升区域发展的“含金量”。
壮士断腕
升级传统工业
走进黑山县庞河经济开发区，曾经轰鸣的机器声似乎还在耳边回响，而今这里已悄然发生翻天覆地的变化。曾经的传统工业区，如今正逐步蜕变为绿色、智能的现代化产业园区，上演着一场“壮士断腕”式的传统工业革新大戏。
一直以来，黑山县的传统工业，如纸品工艺、木制品加工、农机装备等，长期处于全球产业链的“微笑曲线”底端，以生产组装为主，研发与营销环节相对薄弱。同时，传统消费品行业存在供需结构性矛盾，如木业和化工产业，产品同质化严重，亟须通过智能化、品牌化提升市场竞争力，若无法突破低附加值困境，将难以支撑现代化产业体系建设。
2021年，黑山县庞河经济开发区获批国家“十四五”时期重点支持的产业转型升级示范园区，成为政策资源集聚的核心载体。几年来，园区通过淘汰落后产能、引入数字化与绿色化改造，推动“腾笼换鸟”，带动城市更新与低碳发展，助力黑山县实现从“农业大县”向“工业强县”跨越。
4月11日，记者在辽宁逸立达电梯有限公司生产车间看到，工人们正忙碌在操作台前，焊接板材、调试设备……机器的轰鸣声交织成一曲奋进乐章。作为锦州市唯一一家集电梯产品研发、设计、制造、安装、改造、售后服务于一体的“AAA”级现代化企业，在转型发展中曾一度面临重重困境。
“企业发展之初，我们满怀壮志地引进了业内先进生产设备，想借此在市场中迅速站稳脚跟，开疆拓土。”总经理钱富全的目光透过办公室窗户，似乎在回望那段激情燃烧又布满荆棘的岁月，“可市场风云变幻，技术更是日新月异，眨眼间，新的生产标准、更前沿的技术理念不断涌现，我们急需更新设备、投入研发，然而融资难这只‘拦路虎’猛地横在了面前。”说到这里，钱富全微微叹了口气，神情凝重。关键时刻，黑山县政府及时伸出援手，不仅提供政策扶持和资金支持，还积极帮助企业对接高校和科研机构，引进高端人才和技术。在政府和企业的共同努力下，逸立达电梯成功实现转型升级，计划2025年实现年产量1000台，跨入中型电梯企业行列。
黑山县的产业革新之路并不仅限于逸立达电梯一家企业。今年，黑山县将原来的四个主导产业精简为农副产品精深加工、新能源、先进装备制造三个产业，深入实施“12361”高质量发展战略。在转型过程中，制定了严格的环保标准，淘汰一批高污染、高能耗的企业，为绿色发展腾出了空间。同时，积极引导传统企业向绿色化、智能化方向转型。澄明食品产业园、绿源肉业等重大项目发挥支撑作用，加快建设农副产品精深加工、新能源两个百亿级产业集群，并依托恩微电子、微控磁悬浮低温发电机等项目延链强链，推动先进装备制造产业发展新质生产力。
如今，黑山县的传统工业正在经历着深刻的变革。一手抓传统产业转型升级倍增存量，一手抓战略性新兴产业培育壮大引进增量。在这场“壮士断腕”的革新之路上，黑山县展现出浴火重生后的强大韧性与无限潜力。
链式思维
重构产业布局
在黑山县这片充满活力的土地上，传统工业革新与新兴产业培育并驾齐驱，而“链式思维”正成为推动产业布局重构的新引擎。4月14日，记者走进黑山县，亲眼见证了这里是如何立足禀赋做强绿色能源，同时敢为人先布局高端产业，打造绿色发展的新篇章。
清晨的黑山风电场，百余台风机在朝霞中划出优美弧线。2024年底，黑山常兴300MW风电项目实现全容量并网发电。在国家电投东北公司锦州分公司主控室，实时跳动的数据见证着发展奇迹。
“这里年均有效发电时数优势明显，堪称‘风口的明珠’。”项目负责人邱立斌指着三维监控系统介绍。黑山县地处“三北”风带核心区，凭借风速、风力稳定集中、有效发电时数长、交通便利等得天独厚的条件，正崛起为东北地区重要的清洁能源基地。
2023年4月29日，辽宁单体容量最大陆上风电项目——锦州黑山一期400兆瓦风电项目实现全容量并网；2023年12月26日，锦州黑山二期200兆瓦风电项目实现全容量并网；2024年12月28日，锦州黑山常兴300兆瓦风电项目全容量并网发电……随着一个个项目里程碑节点的取得，百万千瓦级新能源大基地建设规模效益尽显。
站在广袤的风电场中，一排排巨大的风力发电机巍峨矗立，叶片在风中缓缓转动，将无尽的风能转化为绿色电能，输送到千家万户。风电项目每年可提供25.1亿千瓦时绿色电能，节约标准煤约76.8万吨，减排二氧化碳约188.34万吨。有力带动省内清洁能源装备制造、科技研发、配套服务等相关产业发展，同时，依托风电大基地规模优势和集群效应，融合发展智能电网、储能、氢能、绿色交通、清洁供热等产业，可有效将辽宁有限的可再生资源优势转化为配套投资优势和上下游产业优势，形成以清洁能源为主体、多元互济的能源生产消费产业链条，有力促进绿色低碳高质量发展。
在高端制造领域，黑山县同样展现出敢为人先的勇气。位于黑山县经济开发区的黑山电子（芯片）科技产业园项目，就是这一布局的生动实践。走进产业园，一期项目净化板工程已装修2个车间，预计4月中旬结束。整个车间整体装修工程预计4月末结束，随后，整体设备入厂调试，开工投产。项目投产运营后，预计年产芯片60亿枚，实现产值3.8亿元，项目建成后，将增强庞河经济开发区综合实力和核心竞争力，带动相关产业发展，助力产业链延伸及产业群集中。
如今，黑山县正以“链式思维”重构产业布局，绿色能源与高端制造双轮驱动，共同绘制出一幅绿色发展的新蓝图。未来，这里将成为更多企业投资兴业的热土，为黑山县经济社会发展注入新的活力。

走进黑山县，无论是风电项目的施工现场，还是高端制造产业园的生产车间，都能感受到政企携手并进的温暖合力。
“政府的支持是我们项目顺利进行的坚强后盾。”黑山风电项目的负责人邱立斌谈及项目建设时满是感慨。在黑山风电项目的建设过程中，政府工作人员主动深入施工现场，实时跟进项目进度，积极协调解决企业遇到的各类难题。为高效推进项目，黑山县政府组建了由县领导挂帅的项目前期工作推进专班，发改、自然资源、交通运输等8个部门的工作人员集中办公，在项目用地、规划、审批、环评等手续办理上开辟绿色通道，确保项目建设一路畅通。
黑山电子（芯片）科技产业园项目建设过程中，黑山县政府同样给予了全方位的支持。从项目选址、规划审批到施工建设，每一个环节都有政府工作人员忙碌的身影。为确保项目的顺利进行，黑山县还成立了专门的项目服务小组，为企业提供“保姆式”服务。
当下，黑山县正积极建设中国北方杂粮加工县域物流枢纽。走进物流园区，可以看到综合物流园区、 农产品 公用保鲜仓储、10万吨粮食仓储库等项目正在紧锣密鼓的建设中。这些项目的落地实施，将逐步完善黑山县的物流发展布局，为经济发展提供更加有力的支撑。
在政府和企业的共同努力下，黑山县的工业转型取得显著成效。传统产业得到了革新升级，绿色能源和高端制造产业蓬勃发展。如今的黑山县，已经不再是过去传统工业占主导地位的县城，取而代之的是一个充满活力和希望的新兴工业城市。
未来，黑山县将继续坚持绿色发展理念，以新能源和高端制造为引领，推动工业转型向纵深发展。政府将进一步完善新能源产业链，提高风电、光伏等绿色能源的占比；同时，还将继续加大高端制造产业的布局力度，吸引更多的高端企业和人才入驻。",2025-04-17T01:02:00.000+03:00,https://finance.sina.com.cn/jjxw/2025-04-17/doc-inetmkhf9489777.shtml,sina.com.cn,positive
"四川""个转企一件事""为企业减负增效|许可_新浪财经_新浪网","本报成都讯（记者刘铭）近日，记者从四川省市场监管局了解到，该局联合相关部门印发了《“个体工商户转型为企业一件事”优化提升工作方案》（以下简称《方案》）。《方案》通过跨部门、跨层级、跨地区的流程再造与数据共享，推行“流程云管理、信息云共享、结果云反馈”的“个转企一件事”模式，为“个转企”提供统一规范、高效便捷的政务服务，进一步优化营商环境，推动改革从宏观制度性调整向微观感受度提升转变。
　　《方案》首次探索实现登记事项与许可事项联办。将与个体工商户经营关联紧密、需求较多的道路货物运输经营许可及道路运输证变更、烟草专卖零售许可3个事项纳入“个转企一件事”改革范畴。申请人在申请“个转企”时，可同步申请道路货物运输经营许可及道路运输证变更，转型为个人独资企业的个体工商户，可同步变更烟草专卖零售许可，实现“一次申请、准入即准营”。
　　《方案》提出，“个转企一件事”服务平台为申请人提供清税信息自助核验服务，未办理清税的个体工商户可通过提供的通道自助办理清税；申请人在申请“个转企”变更登记时，市场监管部门同步查询交通运输部门、烟草专卖部门核验相关许可办理情况，对已经办理相关许可的，智能提示同步办理相关许可变更需求，减少申请人跑动次数。
　　《方案》新增“个转企”转型前清税信息核验环节，个体工商户在转型过程中，采取“事前温馨提示+事中人工反馈”双模式，对不符合“个转企”转型条件的企业，将意见反馈至服务平台，提示企业及时完成清税，防止申请人转型后因欠税受到相关行政部门的约束和惩戒。对符合“个转企”转型条件的，税务部门按规定直接予以变更，无需企业再次提交申请材料。
　　按照个体工商户转型的需求，《方案》将“个转企”各部门办理事项颗粒化，形成16个情形事项，申请人可根据实际情况选择组合。同时，提供“同步办理”和“分段办理”两种模式。选择“同步办理”的，市场监管部门将信息同步推送至相关部门；选择“分段办理”的，待市场监管迁移登记办理完成后，企业可根据自身需求继续办理其他事项。
　　《方案》提出，对于材料齐全、符合法定形式的企业，市场监管部门于1个工作日内办理完变更登记（备案）；其他部门办理时限不超过4个工作日。办理时限由原来“个转企一件事”的9个工作日压减至现在的5个工作日办结，办理效率提速44%；提交材料由改革前的30份精简到约8份，提交材料压缩率达73%。",2025-04-17T01:04:00.000+03:00,https://finance.sina.com.cn/jjxw/2025-04-17/doc-inetmkhf9490220.shtml,sina.com.cn,positive
开局良好！一季度我国GDP同比增长5.4%,"经济成绩单四大“量”点：数量增、质量升、变量显、增量足
　　一季度我国经济起步平稳，开局良好。国家统计局4月16日发布的数据显示，一季度国内生产总值（GDP）318758亿元，按不变价格计算，同比增长5.4%，比上年四季度环比增长1.2%。3月当月，工业生产、消费、投资增速均比1至2月有所加快。专家分析，一季度经济增速超出预期，前期出台的宏观政策和今年以来扩容加码的增量政策叠加发力，有效扩大了需求。
　　国家统计局副局长盛来运4月16日在国新办新闻发布会上表示，从短期来看，美国加征高额关税会对我国经济和外贸带来一定压力，但是改变不了中国经济持续长期向好的大势。中国经济基础稳、优势多、韧性强、潜力大，有底气、有能力、有信心应对外部挑战，实现既定发展目标。
　　 数量增——GDP同比增长5.4%
　　一季度经济增长稳中有升。一季度国内生产总值达到318758亿元，按不变价格计算，同比增长5.4%，这一增速高于去年全年5%的增速，也高于去年一季度5.3%的增速，在全球主要经济体中名列前茅。
　　宏观政策“组合拳”效应持续释放，主要生产需求指标加快回升。数据显示，一季度，规模以上工业增加值同比增长6.5%，投资同比增长4.2%，消费同比增长4.6%，三个指标的增速较去年全年、1至2月均加快。
　　一季度，我国居民就业和收入总体稳定，收入增长与GDP增长基本同步。数据显示，一季度，全国城镇调查失业率指标是5.3%，3月全国城镇调查失业率是5.2%，比2月回落0.2个百分点。全国居民人均可支配收入，扣除物价因素，实际同比增长5.6%，与GDP增长基本同步。
　　 质量升——产业、需求结构改善
　　一季度我国经济高质量发展“向新向好”，新质生产力培育壮大。
　　从产业结构看，规模以上装备制造业、高技术制造业增加值占规模以上工业的比重继续提升。一季度，装备制造业的比重达到33.7%，同比提高1.9个百分点，高技术制造业的比重是15.7%，提高0.5个百分点。
　　从需求结构看，高技术产业投资比重上升。一季度，高技术产业投资同比增长6.5%，占全部投资的比重是10.3%，同比提高0.3个百分点。过去五年，三大需求中，内需对经济增长的平均贡献率超过80%。
　　生产端和需求端都呈现出向智能化、绿色化转型的趋势。一季度，新能源汽车产量同比增长45.4%，充电桩产量同比增长26.3%；非化石能源消费占能源消费总量的比重同比提高了1.5个百分点。
　　“我国经济持续推动转型升级和高质量发展，原来依靠投资和出口带动的发展模式发生了根本改变，依靠内需和创新驱动共同推动的经济增长新格局正在形成。”盛来运表示。
　　 变量显——“两重”“两新”效应显现
　　今年以来，“两重”“两新”政策支持力度更大、补贴范围更广，政策效应持续显现，内需全面发力，成为推动经济实现“开门红”的主要动力。
　　在消费品以旧换新政策带动下，电动自行车、手机、平板、智能手表等产品销售增速较高。数据显示，一季度，限额以上单位通讯器材类商品零售额同比增长26.9%，家用电器和音像器材类商品零售额同比增长19.3%。
　　在大规模设备更新政策带动下，一季度设备工器具购置投资同比增长19%，比去年全年加快3.3个百分点，对全部投资增长贡献率是64.6%，有效拉动了投资。
　　“两新”“两重”政策相关产品的制造业也表现较好。比如，一季度，农产品加工专用设备、包装专用设备产品产量同比增长达到两位数。
　　 增量足——择机推出增量政策
　　当前，外部环境更趋复杂严峻，经济持续回升向好基础还需巩固。下阶段，为了应对外部环境的不确定性，更加积极有为的宏观政策有望加码，推动经济运行持续向好。
　　“存量政策和增量政策共同发力，推动今年一季度经济开局良好。美国加征高额关税，二季度出口可能面临较大挑战，择机推出增量政策的必要性上升。”民生银行首席经济学家兼研究院院长温彬表示。
　　货币政策方面，央行此前明确，将根据国内外经济金融形势和金融市场运行情况，择机降准降息。分析人士预计货币政策将加强逆周期调节，未来各项货币政策举措将会有效落地。
　　财政政策方面，今年以来，地方新增专项债发行提速，带动了到位资金的改善和项目的推进。一季度，新增专项债累计发行量接近1万亿元，固定资产投资实际到位资金同比增长3.7%。中办、国办印发的《提振消费专项行动方案》要求“发挥财政政策引导带动作用”“将促消费同惠民生、补短板结合起来”。受访专家认为，加大消费补贴力度等更加积极的财政政策发力可期。",2025-04-17T01:01:00.000+03:00,http://news.10jqka.com.cn/20250417/c667524348.shtml,上海证券报·中国证券网,positive
"Column: VA is improving, not cutting, service to veterans","The Virginian-Pilot and Daily Press say their mission is to “deliver the truth every day.” But that doesn’t always happen.
A handful of reckless politicians and their media allies have spent the last two months trying to scare veterans into thinking the Trump administration is cutting their Department of Veterans Affairs health care and benefits.
That couldn’t be further from the truth. As I’ve said repeatedly, we’re reforming the VA to eliminate the waste and bureaucracy that have gotten in the way of veteran care for years — problems no one has attempted to fix until now.
Here in Virginia, Sen. Tim Kaine and Rep. Bobby Scott have been lying brazenly about the staffing situation at VA’s new North Battlefield Outpatient Clinic. They said the new clinic is going to open with only 30% of the staff it needs and blamed the situation on our efforts to fix problems across the department.
Did The Virginian-Pilot and Daily Press Editorial Board question these lies? Nope. The board reported them uncritically without checking the facts in an uninformed editorial (“Caring for our warriors,” April 9).
There were so many errors, it was hard to know where to even begin. Among other things, the piece claimed that:
- The North Battlefield clinic would open with “only 150” employees, 350 less than it should have, a situation it blamed on “deep staffing cuts across the VA.”
- The Trump administration wants to slash veterans’ health care across the nation.
- We have no plan for reforming VA.
- The VA is only for “military retirees.”
It’s amazing that the editorial board, which serves a state and region with such a rich military history, knows so little about VA. But if its only source of information is career politicians whose goal is scoring political points by scaring veterans, it’s no surprise the board is so woefully uninformed.
We contacted the editorial board and asked for corrections. Among other things, we noted that:
- The North Battlefield clinic is right on track in terms of staffing. Like most VA clinics, North Battlefield is opening in phases and the facility is expected to have about 540 staff members by early 2026.
- The Trump administration isn’t slashing health care or benefits — it’s expanding them. To that end, we’ve opened several new VA clinics since President Donald Trump took office in January.
- We have plenty of plans to reform VA, such as the one
published in The Hill on March 6. What’s more, anyone who spends five minutes looking at our website (news.va.gov/va-press-room) can see the progress we’ve made to better serve veterans, including processing disability claims faster than ever before, accelerating the deployment of a new medical records system and redirecting hundreds of millions of dollars from non-mission critical efforts to health care, benefits and services that directly support VA beneficiaries. - The VA serves all eligible veterans, families, caregivers and survivors — not just military retirees, as the editorial mistakenly claimed.
The editorial board’s reaction to our request was exactly what you’d expect given the state of today’s media. It made a few trivial, cosmetic changes but otherwise refused to present both sides of the story in its editorial.
If the board had any integrity, it would have admitted its editorial was based on false assumptions about how VA operates and a failure to do even the most basic reporting. Instead, the board was too busy regurgitating political talking points to care.
Unfortunately, our experience with The Virginian-Pilot and Daily Press Editorial Board is par for the course. Like most other media outlets, the board refuses to cover the Trump administration fairly or accurately, regardless of what the facts are.
This is a sad state of affairs, but there is one silver lining.
If this guest column runs on the opinion page, the papers will at least be delivering the truth today. Maybe not every day, as their mission dictates, but it’s a start.
Doug Collins (@SecVetAffairs on X) is the 12th secretary of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.

Trump Backs Texas Legislators for Pushing School Vouchers Bill,"A roomful of Texas lawmakers and Gov. Gregg Abbott joined President Donald Trump on a phone call on Wednesday to reaffirm Republican commitment to universal school choice in the Lone Star State.
The meeting took place in Austin during a break from the House floor. The legislation, which was already approved by the state Senate, earmarks $1 billion for private school vouchers in the first year, or up to $10,000 per selected child.
It also provides up to $2,000 for homeschooling expenses and up to $30,000 for special education students who choose a different school. Low-income students would receive priority consideration. The Legislature could increase the allocation in future years based on interest from Texas families.
A vote on the measure, Senate Bill 2, was postponed on Wednesday afternoon so House members could first discuss the $8 billion public school appropriations bill—House Bill 2—which has implications for universal school choice because many Democrats have said increased funding on public schools, especially in the way of special education, should take priority over school measures.
The bill passed 144–4 and now goes to the state Senate.
X.
“It’s [Texas] leading in energy and leading in jobs,” Trump said. “And now we’re going to be leading in education too. I just think it’s a really forward-thinking vote.”
Universal school choice legislation has failed in the past, but several Republicans who opposed it, some of them in very rural areas where there are no alternatives to public schools, were not reelected last year. Texas Policy Research, a nonprofit that reports on the state Legislature, indicates that there are enough Republicans in the House to push through school choice even if all 62 Democrats in that branch oppose it.
On the House floor on Wednesday, Democrats wore “I Love Public Schools” stickers on their lapels.
Democrats have argued that Texas universal school choice allows private schools to deny students admission even though those vouchers are paid with taxpayer dollars that would otherwise go to public schools.
They have also said that many schools in urban areas and suburbs charge more than $40,000 per year and wouldn’t be attainable for low-income recipients.
There appeared to be bipartisan support for the $8 billion public school appropriations bill despite some concerns about funding inequities among some schools for programs such as bilingual instruction.
Democrats and Republicans continued to make amendments to House Bill 2 into the afternoon.
Rep. Brad Buckley (R-Salado) said the public school appropriations package includes more funding per student, significant salary hikes for teachers, additional money for teacher certifications and training, and more than $1 billion for special education programs.
“It’s the largest school funding bill in Texas history,” he said.",2025-04-17T00:57:00.000+03:00,https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/trump-backs-texas-legislators-for-pushing-school-vouchers-bill-5842942,Aaron Gifford,positive

"Buhari's group CPC declares loyalty to Tinubu, dismisses plot to leave APC","Members of Congress for Progressive Change (CPC) bloc have reaffirmed their loyalty to President Bola Tinubu and the ruling party, the All Progressives Congress (APC).
The defunct CPC is former President Muhammadu Buhari's party. It merged with others to form the APC and eventually kicked out the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) from power in 2015 after the latter had ruled for 16 years.
Other parties that formed the merger include the new Peoples Democratic Party (nPDP), Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN), All Nigeria Peoples Party (ANPP), and a faction of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA).
Meanwhile, there have been speculations about a purported move by the CPC bloc to exit the APC over the Tinubu administration's alleged marginalisation.
ALSO READ: PDP leaders are secretly backing APC – coalition alleges
The reports come amid growing talks by main opposition leaders to form a big coalition ahead of the 2027 elections to challenge the ruling APC.
However, in a statement issued after a meeting on Wednesday, April 16, 2025, the CPC bloc described the rumoured defection of their members as “false and mischievous.”
They reiterated that they “remain resolutely committed to the APC,” describing the party as a “collective project” that must be protected.
“We, the undersigned leaders and committed members of the former Congress for Progressive Change (CPC), who were part of those instrumental in the historic merger that gave birth to the All Progressives Congress (APC), hereby issue this statement to clarify our unalloyed loyalty to our great party and express firm solidarity with the administration of President Bola Ahmed Tinubu, GCFR,” the statement reads.
“We wish to state categorically that we have neither left the APC nor do we intend to leave.
“The CPC bloc remains one of the legacy foundations of the APC, and we are resolute in our commitment to the party and its progressive ideals.”
CPC bloc is proud to be part of the APC
At the same time, bloc members stressed that they are proud of the sacrifices made to build the APC and warned against any attempt to dismantle the platform.
“We will not allow some people to dismantle the party we helped to build through years of tireless work and dedication,” the group said.
The former CPC members described ongoing efforts to sow a seed of discord in the ruling party as an act of “division and desperation” that they “totally reject.”
“We align ourselves fully with the economic and governance reforms being undertaken by President Bola Tinubu,” the CPC leaders said.
“Though challenging, these policies are necessary steps to rebuild our economy and secure a better future for all Nigerians.
“We urge patience and collective support as the benefits unfold; while we acknowledge that some party members may feel sidelined, we emphasise that such grievances are not exclusive to any one bloc.

“We advise those concerned to seek redress through constitutional channels within the party and not to resort to negative public agitation or hasty exits from the party.”
The statement was signed by 23 leaders of the defunct party, including former governors of Katsina and Nasarawa, Aminu Masari and Umaru Al-Makura, respectively; Adamu Adamu, former education minister; and Farouk Aliyu, former member of the House of Representatives.
Others include Lucy Ajayi, former executive director of the Lagos International Trade Fair Complex Management Board; Okoi Obono-Obla, former presidential aide; and Osita Okechukwu, former director-general of the Voice of Nigeria (VON).",2025-04-17T00:59:00.000+03:00,https://www.pulse.ng/articles/politics/buharis-group-cpc-declares-loyalty-to-tinubu-dismisses-plot-to-leave-apc-2025041621594898765,Nurudeen Shotayo,positive
"El beneficio de TSMC en el primer trimestre se dispara, pero las políticas de Trump enturbian su futuro","El beneficio de TSMC en el primer trimestre se dispara, pero las políticas de Trump enturbian su futuro
- Los analistas esperan un beneficio de 10 900 millones en el primer trimestre
- Los ingresos del primer trimestre se disparan y superan las expectativas del mercado
- La administración Trump, una gran incertidumbre para TSMC
- Convocatoria de resultados a las 0600 GMT del jueves
TSMC 2330, el principal productor mundial de chips avanzados utilizados en aplicaciones de inteligencia artificial, está listo para reportar un salto del 57% en la ganancia del primer trimestre el jueves, aunque también es probable que señale los riesgos de las políticas comerciales del presidente estadounidense Donald Trump (link).
El mayor fabricante de chips por contrato del mundo, entre cuyos clientes figuran Apple AAPL y Nvidia NVDA, se ha beneficiado de la tendencia a integrar funciones de IA en los productos en línea. Pero la empresa se enfrenta a vientos en contra por los aranceles de importación de Trump (link) y sus críticas al dominio de Taiwán en la industria de chips.
Se espera que Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co 2330 registre un beneficio neto de 354.600 millones de dólares taiwaneses (10.920 millones de dólares) en los tres meses finalizados el 31 de marzo, según una estimación de LSEG SmartEstimate elaborada a partir de 18 analistas. Las SmartEstimates dan mayor peso a las previsiones de los analistas que son más consistentemente precisas.
Esa estimación se compara con el beneficio neto del primer trimestre de 2024, de 225.500 millones de dólares.
TSMC ha estado gastando miles de millones de dólares en nuevas fábricas en el extranjero, aunque ha dicho que la mayor parte de la fabricación permanecerá en Taiwán. El mes pasado anunció con Trump en la Casa Blanca planes de inversión en EE.UU. por valor de 100.000 millones de dólares en , además de los 65.000 millones prometidos para tres plantas en el estado de Arizona.
Trump ha elogiado a la industria taiwanesa de chips y la ha amenazado con aranceles.
La semana pasada, Trump dijo que había dicho a TSMC que tendría que pagar un impuesto de hasta el 100% si no construía fábricas en Estados Unidos.
La administración Trump también está sondeando la importación de chips , junto con productos farmacéuticos, en un intento de imponer aranceles a ambos alegando que la amplia dependencia de la producción extranjera de semiconductores y medicamentos es una amenaza para la seguridad nacional.
TSMC comunicó la semana pasada un aumento de sus ingresos del primer trimestre en dólares taiwaneses, ligeramente por encima de las expectativas del mercado. La empresa dará a conocer sus previsiones de ingresos en dólares estadounidenses en su conferencia sobre resultados trimestrales, prevista para las 0600 GMT del jueves.
También actualizará sus perspectivas para el trimestre en curso y para todo el año, incluidos los gastos de capital previstos para aumentar la producción.
En su última presentación de resultados en enero, TSMC dijo que esperaba un gasto de capital este año de entre 38.000 y 42.000 millones de dólares, un aumento de hasta el 41% con respecto al año pasado.
Si bien el auge de la IA había contribuido anteriormente a elevar el precio de las acciones de TSMC, éstas han caído un 20% en lo que va de año ante la incertidumbre sobre las políticas comerciales y arancelarias de Estados Unidos.
En Taiwán, la empresa es tan importante para la economía orientada a la exportación que a menudo se la denomina coloquialmente la ""montaña sagrada que protege al país"".

TN legislators need to protect the 340B Drug Pricing Program | Opinion,"Poor Tennesseans need affordable meds. This bill ensures they can access them. | Opinion
HB 1242/SB 1414 is a bill before the Tennessee General Assembly that can protect 340B and the ability of struggling Tennesseans to purchase affordable drugs.
- Eight other states have passed similar laws to protect affordable drug pricing
- All savings from affordable drug plans must be reinvested into patient care
- This care may include pediatrics, dental care, and medication management for low-income and uninsured patients
Tennesseans already struggling to afford their prescriptions are now facing even bigger challenges. The 340B Drug Pricing Program, which helps provide affordable medications through safety-net providers, is under attack.
In recent years, drug companies have limited how the program uses contract pharmacies, making it harder for patients to get the medications and care they need.
House Bill 1242 / Senate Bill 1414, a bill before the Tennessee General Assembly, aims to stop these harmful practices and protect 340B. If passed, Tennessee will join states like Arkansas, Louisiana, and Mississippi in protecting patients' access to affordable medication.
Here’s how 340B works: Drug companies agree to sell certain outpatient medications at a discount to safety-net providers, such as community health centers. In return, these companies receive Medicaid and Medicare payments. Providers then use the savings to make medications affordable and support critical services like pediatrics, dental care, and medication management for low-income and uninsured patients.
Contract pharmacies – including local pharmacies – are essential to this process. They help ensure patients receive their medications close to home. But drug companies are now restricting how these pharmacies can take part, cutting off access to life-saving medications and vital services for patients.
Avoid higher medical costs for everyone
These restrictions hit rural and low-income communities the hardest, where community health centers and local pharmacies are often the only healthcare providers available. B
y undermining the 340B program, drug manufacturers not only harm patients but also place added strain on pharmacies already navigating tight margins and rising costs.
For patients, this means they may go without needed care, leading to worsening health, more emergency room visits, and higher costs for everyone.
Here's the reality: Protecting the 340B program is a win for both patients and Tennessee’s bottom line.
Unlike many healthcare programs, 340B doesn’t use taxpayer dollars. And community health centers must reinvest all 340B savings into patient care. This helps lower prescription costs for patients and supports vital services, like OB care in rural areas, which might not survive otherwise.
Legislature should choose people over profits
Passing HB 1242 / SB 1414 will put patients first. To date, eight other states have already stepped up to protect their residents by passing similar laws. Tennessee lawmakers can – and must – do the same.
Pharmaceutical companies’ efforts to limit 340B are clear: They want to boost their profits, leaving our state’s most vulnerable patients struggling to obtain the care they need.
The question remains, when is enough, enough?
It’s time for Tennessee legislators to act. Pass HB 1242 / SB 1414 and protect access to affordable medications for the patients who need them most.
Editor's note: The Senate version passed 27-5 and the House version passed 82-4, both on April 16.

Developer Scott Rechler's big vision for Manhattan's skyline,"New York City real estate developer Scott Rechler is on a mission to reshape Manhattan’s future — and skyline.
As CEO of RXR, Rechler has $17 billion in properties under his management but also finds time to squeeze in being on the MTA board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Board of Directors, giving him a deeper understanding of the city’s infrastructure and its challenges than almost anyone else in Manhattan.
A lifelong New Yorker born on Long Island, Rechler’s optimism for the city’s potential is tempered by the realism that success in the city is never guaranteed.
“New York… has proven over and over that it can rebuild itself bigger and stronger, but it’s not something that’s preordained and it’s something that we can’t take for granted,” he told me.
4 A rendering of 175 Park Avenue where a hotel will occupy the top floors. Ekoo Media, Inc./Skidmore, Owings & Merrill Rechler thinks now — more than ever — we need to invest in creating something that will last, which is why he is planning to build the ultimate skyscraper at 175 Park Avenue, which he claims will be the tallest building by occupied floor in the Western Hemisphere at 1,581 feet.
Technically, One World Trade Center is taller but Rechler notes its that building’s 408 foot spire which makes it 1,776 feet.
Quibbling aside, the project will create an entirely new skyline in Manhattan by 2030, when Rechler hopes the project will be completed.
Rechler draws parallels to Trump’s transformation of the dilapidated Commodore Hotel into the Grand Hyatt during a grim chapter in New York’s history in the 80s, which sits adjacent to where his own project will be.

Skidmore Owings & Merrill “The city was just coming out of a really tough time… and that Commodore hotel, which was a public-private partnership… actually lifted the city up.
“We’ll have the opportunity to actually sort of fulfill what was his [Trump’s] original dream, which is a much taller building on that site,” he adds.
But Rechler clarifies his project is about more than height.
“As you reimagine and want to reinvent places like New York, you’ve got … to build things that are the best that they can be — things that are going to grab people’s imagination. “
“You can imagine people… feel energized and proud to walk into that building.”
4 “New York… has proven over and over that it can rebuild itself bigger and stronger, but it’s not something that’s preordained and it’s something that we can’t take for granted,” Rechler said. Stephen Yang This seems to align with Trump’s own vision, which was laid out in a recent executive order which stated: “Federal public buildings should be visually identifiable as civic buildings and respect regional, traditional, and classical architectural heritage in order to uplift and beautify public spaces.”
While Rechler is excited to highlight RXR’s expanding vertical presence in New York City, the biggest change for the average New Yorker may be how office space is reshaping the city.
Amid a dramatic return to the office, high-end offices are booming — with companies like JPMorgan not only building more space but holding onto temporary offices as well.

Restituiscono gli animali sequestrati alla madre di Ariel Ruiz Urquiola,"Sono tornati a casa i due animali che erano fuggiti dalla fattoria di Ariel Ruiz Urquiola e sono stati ""sequestrati"" per due giorni da un vicino. Quest'ultimo non ha voluto raggiungere un accordo con la madre del scientifico cubano, che vive in Svizzera perché il regime di L'Avana le impedisce l'ingresso nell'Isola.
Invece di concordare con la madre dei Ruiz Urquiola un risarcimento per la rottura della recinzione perimetrale, il vicino, conosciuto come El Niño Dopico, si è rivolto a agenti del DTI e alle autorità del Ministero dell'Agricoltura della provincia, come confermato dallo stesso attivista in due collegamenti in diretta realizzati da CiberCuba per denunciare ciò che stava accadendo in tempo reale.
Gli animali sono rimasti al sole per due giorni, durante i quali la mamma di Ariel Ruiz Urquiola ha temuto il peggio: che venissero sequestrati. E in questo caso la situazione era particolarmente dolorosa perché lei aveva assistito alla nascita di uno dei vitelli sequestrati. Infine, l'impatto mediatico di ciò che stava accadendo in tempo reale ha dato risultati.
Si presenta la circostanza che lo stesso giorno in cui gli animali furono ""sequestrati"", uno dei lavoratori della finca di cui Ariel Ruiz Urquiola ha l'usufrutto a Viñales (Pinar del Río) si dimise e il cui contratto non ha potuto rinnovare perché non gli è permesso entrare a Cuba per farlo. Questa situazione provocata dal regime stesso è stata utilizzata dalle autorità del Ministero dell'Agricoltura per sostenere che, a causa dell'inadempimento del contratto, la finca deve essere sgomberata e gli animali sequestrati.
Lo scorso dicembre, le autorità del Partito Comunista, sul modello della vecchia Guardia Rurale, sono arrivate nella fattoria e hanno minacciato di portare via tutti gli animali, anche se sono riusciti a sequestrarne solo due.
In questa occasione hanno utilizzato un approccio diverso, ma l'obiettivo è lo stesso: portarsi via poco a poco tutti gli animali. La madre di Ariel Ruiz Urquiola è decisa a rimanere a Viñales ""fino all'ultimo bovino"".
Da parte sua, Ruiz Urquiola ha avviato una protesta pacifica davanti al Bundeshaus, a Berna, per reclamare il rispetto dei diritti della sua famiglia.
In un video inviato a CiberCuba, Ariel Ruiz Urquiola esprime gratitudine al pubblico di questa piattaforma per averlo aiutato a recuperare i suoi animali. ""Voglio ringraziarvi per averci aiutato ad amplificare questa ennesima violazione flagrante dei diritti umani di una anziana, in questo caso, di mia madre, e degli animali, che hanno anch'essi diritti, anche se in un paese senza diritti per le persone, quali diritti possono esserci per gli animali?""

"Commentary | By saying 'no' to Trump, Harvard saves its soul - Santa Cruz Sentinel","Harvard University just gave us all a lesson in how to answer a bully with one powerful word: “No.”
The Trump administration tried to intimidate Harvard — as it has so many government agencies, corporate executives, law firms and other universities — by threatening to cut off government money. In Harvard’s case, that meant a “review” of $8.7 billion in multiyear grants. The administration last week demanded a humiliating settlement that would have imposed an outside “audit” of faculty hiring, student admissions and other internal matters.
Harvard refused to capitulate. “The university will not surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights,” wrote Harvard President Alan M. Garber on Monday. “No government — regardless of which party is in power — should dictate what private universities can teach, whom they can admit and hire, and which areas of study and inquiry they can pursue.”
President Donald Trump doesn’t like “no” for an answer. So, on Monday night, the administration quickly followed through on its threats by freezing $2.2 billion in grants to the university. Harvard will suffer a world of pain as this First Amendment drama plays out. But in this graduate’s eyes, at least, the university has saved its everlasting soul.
Harvard and many other great universities had seemed to be wandering in a wilderness of uncertainty and equivocation until Monday’s stand on principle. Free speech on campuses was imperiled from the left and right, especially after the Hamas terrorist attack on Oct. 7, 2023. Jewish students felt threatened, and so did pro-Palestinian protesters. When university presidents tied to explain campus rules, they seemed incoherent.
“Will Harvard Bend or Break?” was the title of a lengthy New Yorker article published last month. It explained how the Harvard Corporation, the university’s governing body, had suffered the embarrassment of appointing Claudine Gay as Harvard’s first Black president in July 2023, only to fire her six months later amid criticism of Harvard’s failure to curb antisemitism on campus and her alleged plagiarism.
Harvard’s crisis deepened on March 31, when the White House announced its review of $8.7 billion in grants and then, on April 3, sent its first draft of settlement demands. To restore $400 million in threatened cuts, Columbia University had already caved to Trump’s demands.
Penny Pritzker, a former Commerce secretary who’s the senior fellow of the corporation, struggled with her colleagues this month for consensus about Harvard’s values, its fears about the future and its red lines, a Harvard official told me. Through these discussions, one participant said, the corporation reflected on the meaning of Harvard’s Latin motto: Veritas, or “truth.”
The Trump administration’s diktat last Friday crossed that red line. Federal “investment” in Harvard through the billions in research grants wasn’t an “entitlement,” the April 11 letter warned. To “maintain Harvard’s financial relationship with the federal government,” it must alter its governance, reduce the power of students and faculty, cease any racial or other preferences, and screen international students who are “supportive of terrorism or anti-Semitism.”
It got worse: The government’s letter demanded that Harvard accept an outside audit of its students, faculty, staff and leadership to ensure “viewpoint diversity” — code for installing more pro-Trump voices. Whatever you think of Harvard’s skewed ideological mix (in a 2022 poll by the Harvard Crimson, more than 80% of the faculty described themselves as “liberal” or “very liberal”), this isn’t a problem the government should fix.
The corporation bravely rejected the deal, and within hours the administration froze the $2.2 billion in grants.
Freedom isn’t free, as the saying goes. Harvard will now begin to pay what officials recognize is a very painful price for its independence. The university had a whopping $53.2 billion in its endowment as of last October, but much of that money is tied up in thousands of separate bequests and can’t be easily tapped.
Harvard said last week that it plans to borrow $750 million to deal with its financial needs. But university officials told me private money won’t be able to make up the government shortfall — and Garber is already reckoning with the need for layoffs and budget cuts that will erode Harvard’s research mission, perhaps for years to come.
What’s really going on in this battle for Harvard’s soul? Martin Wolf of the Financial Times argued recently that Trump, like Mao Zedong in China more than 50 years ago, has embarked on a “cultural revolution” that seeks “to overthrow the bureaucratic and cultural elites” that are anchored in the nation’s great universities.
Liberal professors aren’t yet forced to wear dunce caps or work in “reeducation camps” in farms and factories. Maybe that’s next. For the moment, a salute to “Fair Harvard,” and how it’s living the motto, veritas.",2025-04-17T01:00:00.000+03:00,https://www.santacruzsentinel.com/2025/04/16/commentary-by-saying-no-to-trump-harvard-saves-its-soul,David Ignatius,positive
"Religiosos en EE.UU. publican diez ""verdades"" para combatir estigmas sobre inmigrantes - Infobae","Denver (EE.UU.), 16 abr (EFE).- Más de 200 líderes religiosos de Colorado, representando distintas expresiones de fe, divulgaron este miércoles un documento con diez “verdades” destinadas a contrarrestar “falsedades, inexactitudes y caracterizaciones erróneas” sobre los inmigrantes en Estados Unidos.
El documento, firmado por 231 pastores, sacerdotes, rabinos y capellanes de diversas tradiciones religiosas, destaca el impacto económico y el aporte cívico de la población inmigrante, como parte de una campaña para combatir el estigma creciente sobre esta comunidad.
“Los inmigrantes forman parte de nuestras familias, vecindarios y comunidades religiosas. Son nuestros amigos y compañeros de trabajo. Trabajan en los negocios que frecuentamos. Sus hijos son compañeros de clase de los nuestros”, subrayaron los firmantes.
Apoyados en estudios, estadísticas y otras fuentes documentadas, los líderes religiosos expusieron diez afirmaciones clave. Entre ellas, destacaron que los inmigrantes pagan impuestos, suplen la escasez de mano de obra, impulsan la economía y, en su mayoría, no reciben beneficios públicos.
También señalaron que el proceso para inmigrar legalmente es complejo y costoso, que las razones para migrar son múltiples y que la mayoría de los inmigrantes respeta la ley y contribuye a la seguridad de sus comunidades, por lo que no constituyen una amenaza para la seguridad nacional ni pública.
“Al proclamar la verdad, buscamos crear una narrativa más honesta y objetiva que guíe nuestra toma de decisiones a nivel local y nacional”, esgrimieron los religiosos.
Además, advirtieron sobre el impacto negativo que tendrían las deportaciones masivas en sectores clave de la economía, como la construcción, la agricultura y la industria de la hospitalidad.
Al presentar la declaración, el reverendo Mark Meeks, de la Iglesia Presbiteriana Capitol Heights en Denver, expresó que apoya a los inmigrantes porque “aportan amistad, son familias que trabajan juntas para vivir plenamente y son personas de fe que fortalecen los valores morales de nuestra nación”.
La iniciativa fue coordinada por el Comité de Servicio de los Amigos Americanos (AFSC) de Colorado y por la Red Interreligiosa de Inmigración del mismo estado.
La publicación de la declaración coincidió con la aprobación inicial en el Senado estatal de un proyecto de ley que limita la cooperación de las autoridades locales con el Servicio de Inmigración y Aduanas (ICE), así como con el bloqueo temporal, ordenado por una jueza federal en Colorado, del uso de la Ley de Extranjeros Enemigos para llevar a cabo deportaciones.
A nivel nacional, la secretaria de prensa de la Casa Blanca, Karoline Leavitt, aseguró este martes que, en lo referente a deportaciones, “estamos muy seguros de que cada acción tomada por esta administración está dentro de los límites de la ley”.

Town planners recommend approval of fifth short-term rental,"Smithfield’s Planning Commission has recommended approval of what would be the historic district’s fifth year-round short-term rental.
Smithfield changed its zoning ordinance in 2020 to allow homeowners the option of leasing their residences as short-term rentals through booking services like Airbnb and Vrbo, provided the homeowner obtains a town business license and signs a short-term rental affidavit. The ordinance allows “by right” use as a short-term rental for up to 104 nights per calendar year, and requires a special use permit for anything beyond that.
Former Town Councilman Jim Collins is the latest to apply for such a permit. The property in question is 328 Main St. Collins said he currently rents the property as a long-term rental, which the town defines as 30 days or more, and is looking to offer short-term rentals.
The property is adjacent to the circa-1903 Johnson house at 330 Main St., which is under conversion to operate as Feathered Elegance Boutique & Tea Room, in which Collins’ wife is a partner.
Smithfield’s Town Council, which will have the final say on the requested permit, has approved three such permits for full-time short term rentals to date, all in the downtown area. A fourth operating on Mason Street was already operating and grandfathered as of the 2020 change.
The Planning Commission previously voted 4-2 in December to recommend denial of an after-the-fact permit to operate the circa-1946 house at 104 Jordan Drive, which is outside the historic district, as a year-round short-term rental.
Tim Ryan, who’d made the application for 104 Jordan Drive, said he withdrew it before it reached the Town Council after receiving the Planning Commission’s less than favorable reaction and fearing he’d face “the same misinformation issue” about its water connection.
Ryan has been embroiled in a seven-month dispute with town government over its requiring him to connect the circa-1929 former gas station that now operates as Red Point Taphouse to town water. Red Point and 104 Jordan Drive are each currently connected to a private well that predates the town’s annexation of the area. Town staff advised last year that the conversion of the former gas station into a brewery and the then-proposed conversion of 104 Jordan Drive into a short-term rental would require both properties to hook to town water, an assertion Ryan disputes.
The Town Council voted 4-3 on April 1 against granting Red Point Taphouse’s request for a special use permit that would have waived the brewery’s required connection. Ryan and Red Point’s former co-owners, Derek Joyner and Nick Hess, sold the brewery to Ben and Elen Osmanson in January, and the trio say they plan to sell the building to cover the estimated $30,000 cost of hooking to town water.",2025-04-17T01:04:00.000+03:00,https://www.smithfieldtimes.com/2025/04/16/town-planners-recommend-approval-of-fifth-short-term-rental,Stephen Faleski,positive

"中马携手共建""一带一路""成果丰硕","中马携手共建“一带一路”成果丰硕
12年来，中马共建“一带一路”合作取得丰硕成果，基础设施建设不断升级、贸易规模持续扩大、新兴领域合作方兴未艾，成为区域经济一体化和中国—东盟共建“一带一路”的典范。展望未来，中国将与马来西亚一道，将高质量共建“一带一路”推向新高度，为全球南方国家团结合作、共同发展注入正能量。
马来西亚是古代海上丝绸之路沿线重要国家，也是最早响应共建“一带一路”倡议的国家之一，更是共建“一带一路”早期收获最丰硕的国家之一。2013年以来，共建“一带一路”倡议同马来西亚“昌明经济”框架等深度对接，中马合作取得丰硕成果，成为区域经济一体化和中国—东盟共建“一带一路”的典范。
务实合作持续提质升级
当前经济全球化遭遇空前“回头浪”，极限施压和关税讹诈严重扰乱全球贸易秩序，让全球产业链供应链面临断供断链风险，中马共建“一带一路”在逆境中展现出强大活力，为变乱交织的世界注入稳定剂，推动打造更紧密的中国—东盟命运共同体。
基础设施建设不断升级。比如，由中交马东铁项目公司承建的马来西亚东海岸铁路作为中马高质量共建“一带一路”旗舰项目，全长约665公里，计划2027年底竣工，将打通关丹港和巴生港，构建起连接马来西亚东西海岸的重要“陆上桥梁”，填补马来半岛东西岸没有铁路贯通的空白，提升货物运输效率。今年1月，马东铁项目正线A、B段轨道铺通，标志着项目取得重要阶段性进展。
贸易规模持续扩大。中国已连续16年成为马来西亚最大贸易伙伴，而马来西亚则是中国在东盟成员国中的第二大贸易伙伴和最大进口来源国。2024年，中马双边贸易额达到2120亿美元，比两国建交时增长近千倍。中马贸易结构互补性强，中国自马进口计算机零部件、棕榈油和塑料制品等，对马出口服装和纺织品等。
“两国双园”合作不断深入。马中关丹产业园和中马钦州产业园区树立了“两国双园”模式下双边经济合作的创新典范。马中关丹产业园依托两国自然禀赋、产业优势和市场资源，园区产业体系加速构筑，已成为马来西亚东海岸经济特区最成功的工业园区之一。随着扩建工程全面完成，关丹港吞吐量预计将翻番，从2600万吨增至5200万吨，马中关丹产业园升级扩园与新项目建设将进一步促进共建“一带一路”沿线货物流动和贸易发展。
新兴领域合作方兴未艾
随着全球供应链加速重构，中马积极探索共建“一带一路”更深层次的产业链合作。在电子产品和机械制造领域，中马企业形成了产业链“垂直分工”的模式。这种合作模式不仅提高了两国产业链的效率，还带动了相关技术的进步。更重要的是，它增强了中马两国在全球供应链中的竞争力。随着两国产业园区的进一步发展，这种跨境供应链合作将持续拓展到新能源和人工智能等更多领域。
此外，随着中马“绿色丝绸之路”合作不断深入，合作领域也不断拓宽。中国企业在沙巴州建设的地面光伏项目已经上网发电，在吉打州南部的瓜拉基蒂光伏电站商业运行顺利。在制造业领域，中资企业也成为马来西亚光伏行业发展的重要推动力量，有力促进了当地光伏全产业链发展。在新能源汽车领域，马来西亚宝腾汽车与中国吉利控股集团的合资合作，提升了宝腾的生产效率并恢复了其在马来西亚的销售，吉利计划投资100亿美元建设汽车枢纽，预计将吸引更多高质量的电动汽车及零部件投资，提升马来西亚在全球汽车和相关技术领域的地位。
围绕“数字丝绸之路”，中马在人工智能、丝路电商、智慧物流等领域合作取得了长足进步，助力马来西亚建设成为区域数字经济领导者。目前，在中国企业的支持下，马来西亚“数智港口”“绿色智慧电厂”“数智供应链”等项目正在不断落实。
构建更紧密的命运共同体
中马共建“一带一路”走过12年光辉历程，如今又一次站在了新征程起点上。2025年，马来西亚正式成为金砖伙伴国，同时担任东盟轮值主席国和中国—东盟关系协调国。中国将与马来西亚一道，将高质量共建“一带一路”推向新高度，推动构建更为紧密的中国—东盟命运共同体。
加快中国—东盟自贸区3.0版落地。2024年，中国与东盟十国领导人宣布实质性结束中国—东盟自贸区3.0版谈判，马来西亚发挥2025年东盟轮值主席国作用，积极推动中国—东盟自贸区3.0版落实落地，共同反对贸易保护主义。全面深化《区域全面经济伙伴关系协定》（RCEP），有力带动中马共建“一带一路”高质量发展再上新高度，全面拓展新兴领域互利合作，加强标准和规制领域互融互通，促进贸易便利化及包容发展，为中马合作注入新动能，开辟新路径。
统筹推进重大标志性工程和“小而美”民生项目。在共建“一带一路”合作框架下，中马加快建成马东铁标志性工程，进一步提升东盟立体互联互通网络。同时，打造更多中马共建“一带一路”“小而美”民生项目，深化中马农业领域合作，在种植、贸易合作基础上，针对市场需求发挥各自优势，进一步开展农业技术、农业设备、农业基础设施建设、农产品深加工等方面合作，将中马双赢的“榴莲经济学”推广到更多农业合作领域。
通过合作建设皇京港和升级关丹港，有效提升马来西亚航运货运量，进一步释放中国与马来西亚参与地区产业链分工和国际贸易的潜能，对冲贸易保护主义的不确定性，维护中国—东盟产业链供应链稳定。对于双方相互间出口规模较大的产品，进一步优化和加强产业链垂直分工合作，用好两国产业园区，优化跨境供应链，加快推动中马、中国—东盟市场多元整合，为各自发挥优势创造更加有利条件。在稳定供应链、产业链的基础上构建东盟区域价值链，构建区域内多梯度、强互补的产业网络，实现产业链与全球生产体系对接融合，摆脱全球产业价值链“低端锁定”风险，共同推进中马乃至中国—东盟产品向全球价值链高端攀升。
当前，全球局势变乱交织，逆全球化、保护主义行为冲击中国周边和国际经贸体系秩序。但逆流并非主流，中国与马来西亚携手合作，以高质量共建“一带一路”为主要平台，将让古老的海上丝绸之路焕发新的生机，为中国同周边国家开辟友好合作新境界，为全球南方国家团结合作、共同发展注入正能量。

Ex-Agency Officials Praise Trump Bid to Add AI to Permit Process,"The Trump administration’s push to deploy modern technology in environmental permitting is being hailed as a smart move by former government officials on both sides of the aisle.
The positive reaction is a dramatic shift—congressional Democrats and environmentalists have generally opposed almost every other permitting tweak President Donald Trump has announced. Still, questions linger about which technology vendors will provide the solutions and whether documents produced with artificial intelligence (AI) will stand up in court.
Trump’s Tuesday memo directs federal agencies to make “maximum use” of technology in permitting, though it doesn’t mention any specific technology by name. It’s his ...

国内男性九价HPV疫苗首批接种落地长沙 湖南日报数字报刊,"湖南日报4月16日讯（全媒体记者 周顺）进口九价HPV疫苗多项新适应证，于4月14日获得国家药品监督管理局的上市批准，适用于16至26岁男性接种。15日，国内首批适用于男性的九价HPV疫苗在长沙、广州、西安同时开打。这也标志着我国HPV防控正式迈入“男女共防”新阶段，为全人群健康防护再添重要屏障。
据悉，此次国内男性九价HPV疫苗首批接种落地长沙，得益于湖南省在HPV疫苗推广中的多项创新实践。作为全国首批发布《加速消除宫颈癌行动实施方案》的省份，湖南明确将“男女共防”纳入健康战略，长沙市率先构建“线上预约+线下服务”体系，并推出周末接种、社区咨询等便民措施。
“男性是HPV感染的重要传播者和潜在受害者。因此，男女共防是实现群体免疫的关键。”湖南省疾控中心教授陈曦表示，全球范围内90%男性在其一生中至少感染一次HPV，男性感染后虽症状隐匿，但可引发阴茎癌、肛门癌及生殖器疣，且易导致伴侣反复感染。
面对HPV感染的严峻挑战，预防胜于治疗。继今年1月四价HPV疫苗男性适应证获批后，此次九价疫苗的上市为男性健康防护提供了更强大的“武器”。
“四价疫苗覆盖HPV6、11、16、18四种亚型，预防约70%相关疾病；九价疫苗新增HPV31、33、45、52、58五种高危型别，覆盖疾病范围提升至约92%。”长沙市岳麓区疾控中心副主任苏威武指出，相较于四价HPV疫苗，九价HPV疫苗诱导的抗体水平更高，保护期预计超10年，长期成本效益更优。此外，相关部门还将通过动态监测疫苗库存、优化预约流程，确保疫苗供应稳定。
目前，全省已开放超千家接种门诊，16至26岁男性可通过“湖南疾控”微信公众号、“约苗”微信小程序等平台在线预约，选择就近社区接种点。湖南地区九价疫苗单剂价格为1327.5元，需在6个月内完成三剂次接种（0、2、6月）。",2025-04-17T01:14:24.986+03:00,https://epaper.voc.com.cn/hnrb/html/2025-04/17/content_1734019.htm?div=-1,,positive

Chicago OKs ban on Jan. 6 rioters from city jobs | FOX 32 Chicago,"The Brief The City Council passed a resolution urging HR to block the hiring of applicants convicted in the Jan. 6 Capitol attack. The measure passed 43-3 and applies regardless of pardon or clemency status. Alderman Gilbert Villegas led the effort, citing the importance of defending democracy. CHICAGO - Chicago is now the first major U.S. city to adopt a policy aimed at keeping Jan. 6 offenders out of city government jobs.
What we know:
On Wednesday afternoon, the Chicago City Council passed a resolution calling on the city’s Human Resources Commissioner to use discretion in rejecting job applicants who were convicted of crimes tied to the January 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. The measure passed by a wide margin—43 yeas to 3 nays.
Yea-Nay votes on Chicago Jan. 6 hiring resolution | Provided
The resolution, R2025-0015310, applies regardless of whether an applicant has received clemency or a pardon and takes effect immediately.
""You should not be allowed to work for the same government you are attempting to overthrow,"" said Alderman Gilbert Villegas, the resolution’s chief sponsor. ""There is a misalignment in values there.""
The measure comes after the State of Illinois identified 53 residents involved in the Jan. 6 attack, including several from Chicago. At least one was found to be employed by the city as a police officer.

The backstory:
Villegas, a veteran of the United States Marine Corps, said the Capitol riot shook his sense of duty and drew a rare comparison in his life.
""There’s only been two times that I’ve thought about putting my uniform on and reactivating—September 11th and January 6th—because this democracy is worth fighting for,"" he said during council remarks.
He was joined by Aldermen Chris Taliaferro, Bill Conway, and Matt Martin in sponsoring the measure.
What's next:
While the resolution is not a formal ordinance, it strongly signals the City Council’s stance and gives the Commissioner of Human Resources broad backing to apply the new hiring standard going forward.
The resolution takes effect immediately.

中国与东盟各方本币使用基础日益坚实 一季度跨境人民币业务收付金额同比大幅增长,"作为全球第四大支付货币、第三大贸易融资货币，人民币国际化水平稳步提升。上海证券报记者4月16日获悉，一季度，中国与马来西亚、柬埔寨等东盟国家的跨境人民币业务收付金额同比大幅增长，贸易投资本币使用水平持续上升。
　　中国人民银行表示，随着中国与马来西亚、柬埔寨等国家经贸和人员往来日益密切，各方本币使用基础更加坚实，未来将继续完善跨境人民币使用政策，为中国及相关国家经营主体使用人民币进行跨境贸易投资结算提供更加便利、友好的环境。
　　据统计，2025年一季度，中马跨境人民币业务收付金额为1020亿元，同比增长27%；中柬跨境人民币业务收付金额为50亿元，同比增长45%。
　　马来西亚是共建“一带一路”的重要节点国家，中国已经连续16年成为马来西亚第一大贸易伙伴。多年来，中国人民银行立足于中马跨境贸易投资需求，同马来西亚国家银行一道，共同为双边本币结算创造良好的政策环境，促进提升双边贸易投资本币使用水平。
　　2014年，两国央行签署在吉隆坡建立人民币清算安排的合作备忘录，次年授权中国银行（马来西亚）担任吉隆坡人民币业务清算行。记者从中国银行（马来西亚）获悉，该行通过提供授信、国际结算、贸易融资等一揽子金融服务，助力 亿纬锂能 （ 300014 ）、 蔚蓝锂芯 （ 002245 ）、旗滨玻璃、冠宇电池等一批蕴含新质生产力的中资企业在马来西亚开拓市场。
　　为培育壮大离岸人民币市场，中国银行（马来西亚）还先后与国家石油公司（Petronas）、巴生西港（Westport）等马来西亚行业龙头合作，为其提供人民币产品和服务，并撮合这些企业与“走出去”的中资企业开展合作。
　　近年来，中柬经贸合作往来也在不断加强，中国已连续13年保持柬第一大贸易伙伴地位，也是柬最大的外资来源国及重要的旅客来源国。中国人民银行一直高度重视与柬埔寨国家银行的沟通交流和货币合作，推动出台鼓励双边本币使用的政策，跨境结算规模增长迅速。
　　2023年，柬埔寨国家银行与银联国际签署合作备忘录，就两国二维码支付互联互通达成合作。银联用户可以通过扫描KHQR二维码，向在柬的约180万家商户进行支付；柬埔寨居民将能使用Bakong钱包在中国和全球使用银联二维码的商家进行支付。
　　当前，我国正持续推进跨境二维码支付互联互通，为中国及相关国家消费者提供更便捷的跨境支付服务。日前，在中国人民银行与越南国家银行的指导下，银联国际与越南国家支付公司（NAPAS）、中国工商银行、越南外贸银行在河内联合宣布签署合作协议，约定共同推进中越两国跨境二维码支付互联互通。",2025-04-17T01:05:00.000+03:00,http://news.10jqka.com.cn/20250417/c667524382.shtml,上海证券报·中国证券网,positive

"APA, NCPA Cheer First-Of-Its-Kind State Law Banning PBMs from Owning Pharmacies | User | dailytimesleader.com","Alexandria, Va., April 16, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- In a significant victory for patients and community pharmacies in Arkansas, Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders signed HB 1150 into law today. This is groundbreaking legislation that prohibits state permits to pharmacies owned by pharmacy benefit managers effective Jan. 1, 2026. The National Community Pharmacists Association, which represents the country’s independent pharmacies, supported the Arkansas Pharmacists Association’s leadership on HB 1150 as it moved through the legislative process.
APA is the voice of Arkansas pharmacists and has worked hard to advance HB 1150 and other PBM reform efforts. NCPA, which represents the country’s independent community pharmacies, has also persistently advocated that state and federal policymakers rein in the conflicts of interest and anticompetitive business practices that arise with PBMs vertically integrated upstream with health insurers and downstream with pharmacies. These practices include contract terms that restrict competitors’ access to patients, massive clawbacks, steering patients away from competing community pharmacies, below-cost reimbursements, and punitive audit practices. Prohibiting PBM ownership of pharmacies via HB 1150 would put an end to these tactics and promote Arkansans’ access to quality pharmacy care.
“Today is a new day in Arkansas for our patients as the fox will no longer guard the henhouse,” said John Vinson, APA’s chief executive officer. “This bipartisan legislation passed overwhelmingly to protect public health and safety for Arkansans. HB 1150 will stop the abusive self-dealing at PBM affiliated pharmacies that raises prescription drug prices and limits patient access. The pharmacists of Arkansas are very grateful for a courageous legislature and Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders. We also thank Attorney General Tim Griffin for his support.”
“Time and time again, PBMs have proven themselves to be resistant to transparency and reform,” said Anne Cassity, NCPA’s senior vice president of government affairs. “HB 1150 is a structural change that gets to the heart of the problem – the conflicts of interest inherent in vertical integration that PBMs have been manipulating to the detriment of patients, taxpayers, and pharmacies. We applaud HB 1150 and are eager to see its provisions implemented in Arkansas and, ideally, throughout the country.""
Since the introduction of HB 1150, similar ownership provisions were introduced or amended into bills in Indiana, New York, Texas, and Vermont. Additionally, on April 14, a bipartisan coalition of 39 state and territory attorneys general sent a letter to congressional leaders urging them to pass legislation prohibiting PBMs from owning or operating pharmacies. A bill to do so was introduced late last year by Sens. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Reps. Diana Harshbarger (R-Tenn.) – who wrote a letter in support of Arkansas HB 1150 – and Jake Auchincloss (D-Mass.).

Un nuevo paso de peatones unirá la Avenida y Urbieta con la plaza Cervantes,"Secciones
Servicios
Destacamos
El Departamento de Movilidad del Ayuntamiento va a implantar a partir de la semana que viene un nuevo paso de peatones en la avenida de ... la Libertad que unirá el final de la calle Urbieta con la plaza Cervantes, permitiendo así dar una continuidad natural al recorrido peatonal desde la propia Urbieta. Esta actuación está alineada con el «objetivo municipal de priorizar al peatón», señala Olatz Yarza, concejala de Movilidad, y de reforzar los itinerarios peatonales en ejes estratégicos de la ciudad como es este caso.
La actuación prevista, que tiene un presupuesto de 47.205 euros (IVA incluido), pretende facilitar la movilidad de los peatones desde la esquina de la avenida de la Libertad con la calle Urbieta hacia la playa de La Concha, a través de la plaza Cervantes. Hoy en día, para cruzar los pocos metros que separan ambas vías hay que cruzar hasta tres pasos de peatones. El primero es el que está situado en el cruce situado entre la avenida de la Libertad y la calle Urbieta, el segundo une ese punto con la acera de los números pares de la Avenida y el tercero es desde el que se accede a la plaza Cervantes.
Si la climatología lo permite y los trabajos siguen el cronograma presentado por Movilidad, para el inicio del mes de mayo los ciudadanos podrán cruzar desde la avenida de la Libertad directamente a esa zona peatonal de La Concha.
El paso de peatones planteado va a tener una anchura de 3,10 metros y bordillos rebajados para garantizar la accesibilidad de las personas con problemas de movilidad. Los trabajos para la implantación del paso de peatones se va a realizar aprovechando los trabajos de reparación de la rejilla de ventilación que está realizando la empresa Telpark en ese punto de la ciudad, «y no generarán nuevas afecciones al tráfico, ya que se realizará el proceso de pintado por turnos», señala la edil jeltzale.
Las obras de sustitución de la rejilla situada en la calzada del cruce entre la avenida de la Libertad y la calle Urbieta las está realizando la empresa que gestiona el parking municipal de La Concha. Telpark recibió el encargo desde Movilidad para que cambiara esa rejilla que estaba causando problemas a los vehículos que circulaban por ese punto y la rebajara a cota cero. Desde Telpark garantizan que esas obras en las que llevan semanas trabajando estarán finalizadas para cuando el paso de peatones esté implantado.
En cuanto a la marquesina de la parada de taxis que está situada en el cruce de la Avenida con Urbieta, Movilidad anuncia que se reubicará y recolocará al lado de su actual ubicación.

"TSMC Q1 profit set to jump, but Trump's policies cloud its future | MarketScreener","TAIPEI (Reuters) - TSMC, the main global producer of advanced chips used in artificial intelligence applications, is set to report a 57% leap in first-quarter profit on Thursday, though it is also likely to flag risks from U.S. President Donald Trump's trade policies.
The world's largest contract chipmaker, whose customers include Apple and Nvidia, has benefited from a trend towards integrating AI features into online products. But the firm faces headwinds from Trump's import tariffs and his criticism of Taiwan's dominance of the chip industry.
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co is expected to report a net profit of T$354.6 billion ($10.92 billion) for the three months ended March 31, according to a LSEG SmartEstimate drawn from 18 analysts. SmartEstimates give greater weighting to forecasts from analysts who are more consistently accurate.
That estimate compares to the 2024 first-quarter net profit of T$225.5 billion.
TSMC has been spending billions of dollars on new factories overseas, though it has said most manufacturing will remain in Taiwan. It announced plans for a $100 billion U.S. investment with Trump at the White House last month, on top of $65 billion pledged for three plants in the state of Arizona.
Trump has both praised Taiwan's chip industry and threatened it with tariffs.
Last week, Trump said he had told TSMC it would have to pay a tax of up to 100% if it did not build factories in the U.S.
The Trump administration is also probing the import of chips, along with pharmaceuticals, in a bid to impose tariffs on both on the grounds that extensive reliance on foreign production of semiconductors and medicine is a national security threat.
TSMC last week reported a surge in first-quarter revenue in Taiwan dollars, slightly ahead of market expectations. The company gives its revenue outlook in U.S. dollars on its quarterly earnings call, scheduled for 0600 GMT on Thursday.
It will also update its outlook for the current quarter as well as for the full year, including planned capital expenditure for production increases.
On its last earnings call in January, TSMC said it expected capital spending this year of $38 billion to $42 billion, an increase of as much as 41% from last year.
While the AI boom had previously helped to drive up TSMC's stock price, shares have dropped 20% so far this year given uncertainty about U.S. trade and tariff policies.
In Taiwan, the company is so important to the export-oriented economy it is often colloquially referred to as the ""sacred mountain protecting the country"".

And it is not just Mr Loh’s entry into politics that makes the boy, aged 12, more tuned in to current affairs, despite his young age.The family of six does not have a television set at home, so the four children, two boys and two girls, are encouraged to read The Straits Times daily. “I am a subscriber of the hard-copy paper, and I strongly believe that is why my children must also read the paper on a daily basis,” said Mr Loh, speaking to reporters at the Whampoa Drive Market and Food Centre on April 15.

El Ayuntamiento de San Bartolomé ha tomado medidas para hacer oficial la adjudicación, por 6,2 millones de euros, con impuestos, de las obras a dar nueva forma a la céntrica plaza de Santa Elena de Playa Honda. Se ha decidido confiar en las empresas Lanzagrava y Obras Públicas Canarias, según acuerdo adoptado en la mañana de ayer miércoles en junta de gobierno presidida por el alcalde, Isidro Pérez.
Por parte municipal, según previsión trasladada a CANARIAS7 por el regidor, se tiene el propósito de que la firma del contrato sea factible durante mayo próximo. En este supuesto se confía en que a lo largo del verano pueda concretarse el acta de replanteo y que sea posible, además, el comienzo de las primeras faenas, de cara a permitir la construcción de un aparcamiento bajo suelo, el primero en la localidad de más población en el municipio; y de un edificio de usos múltiples.
Para la concreción de los diversos trabajos a ejecutar se ha marcado un periodo de al menos año y medio de actividad, de manera que parece probable tener que esperar hasta bien entrado 2027 para poder contar con las nuevas infraestructuras operando a pleno rendimiento.
El patrocinio de la iniciativa es municipal al completo, gracias a diversos ajustes financieros adoptados durante 2024, una vez que hubo que revisar al alza el presupuesto marcado de salida para la iniciativa, cifrado en 4,5 millones de euros. Con los cambios se pudo sacar la actuación a concurso con una dotación de algo más de 6 millones de euros.
La baza principal de la iniciativa tiene que ver con un gran edificio de usos múltiples, de tres alturas, en la parcela municipal existente, de unos 3.000 metros cuadrados de superficie. Contará con una biblioteca pública, un espacio para mayores y una zona para dar cabida a la actividad cultural cotidiana de Playa Honda, en sintonía con el Centro Cívico.
En cuanto al aparcamiento a concretar bajo una buena parte de la plaza de Santa Elena, contará con capacidad para dar sitio a 110 vehículos. Se tiene previsto que funcione con carácter disuasorio para el tráfico rodado, como ya contó este periódico. Deberá contar con un sistema de control inteligente, con técnicas innovadoras para la gestión del estacionamiento, con presencia de soluciones inteligentes orientadas a simplificar la búsqueda de plazas libres y reducir el número de vehículos en circulación.
La ambiciosa iniciativa, considera el alcalde, «satisface una demanda histórica de colectivos y asociaciones locales que ahora tendrán su propio espacio para desarrollar sus actividades».

"四川""个转企一件事""为企业减负增效_手机新浪网","四川“个转企一件事”为企业减负增效
本报成都讯（记者刘铭）近日，记者从四川省市场监管局了解到，该局联合相关部门印发了《“个体工商户转型为企业一件事”优化提升工作方案》（以下简称《方案》）。《方案》通过跨部门、跨层级、跨地区的流程再造与数据共享，推行“流程云管理、信息云共享、结果云反馈”的“个转企一件事”模式，为“个转企”提供统一规范、高效便捷的政务服务，进一步优化营商环境，推动改革从宏观制度性调整向微观感受度提升转变。
《方案》首次探索实现登记事项与许可事项联办。将与个体工商户经营关联紧密、需求较多的道路货物运输经营许可及道路运输证变更、烟草专卖零售许可3个事项纳入“个转企一件事”改革范畴。申请人在申请“个转企”时，可同步申请道路货物运输经营许可及道路运输证变更，转型为个人独资企业的个体工商户，可同步变更烟草专卖零售许可，实现“一次申请、准入即准营”。
《方案》提出，“个转企一件事”服务平台为申请人提供清税信息自助核验服务，未办理清税的个体工商户可通过提供的通道自助办理清税；申请人在申请“个转企”变更登记时，市场监管部门同步查询交通运输部门、烟草专卖部门核验相关许可办理情况，对已经办理相关许可的，智能提示同步办理相关许可变更需求，减少申请人跑动次数。
《方案》新增“个转企”转型前清税信息核验环节，个体工商户在转型过程中，采取“事前温馨提示+事中人工反馈”双模式，对不符合“个转企”转型条件的企业，将意见反馈至服务平台，提示企业及时完成清税，防止申请人转型后因欠税受到相关行政部门的约束和惩戒。对符合“个转企”转型条件的，税务部门按规定直接予以变更，无需企业再次提交申请材料。
按照个体工商户转型的需求，《方案》将“个转企”各部门办理事项颗粒化，形成16个情形事项，申请人可根据实际情况选择组合。同时，提供“同步办理”和“分段办理”两种模式。选择“同步办理”的，市场监管部门将信息同步推送至相关部门；选择“分段办理”的，待市场监管迁移登记办理完成后，企业可根据自身需求继续办理其他事项。
《方案》提出，对于材料齐全、符合法定形式的企业，市场监管部门于1个工作日内办理完变更登记（备案）；其他部门办理时限不超过4个工作日。办理时限由原来“个转企一件事”的9个工作日压减至现在的5个工作日办结，办理效率提速44%；提交材料由改革前的30份精简到约8份，提交材料压缩率达73%。",2025-04-17T01:16:13.710+03:00,https://finance.sina.cn/2025-04-17/detail-inetmkhf9490220.d.html?vt=4&cid=76729&node_id=76729,sina_mobile,positive

本报南宁讯（何正君 记者顾艳伟）近日，广西壮族自治区南宁市市场监管局会同南宁市政务服务局、南宁市公安局等8部门印发《关于深入推进个体工商户转型为企业“一件事”改革的实施意见》（以下简称《实施意见》），进一步深化“高效办成一件事”改革，加快推进“个转企”工作。
根据《实施意见》，南宁市精减材料，将部门之间的个体工商户转型为企业，申请材料整合为一张表单——《个体工商户转型为企业“一件事”登记文书》，通过广泛应用信息共享和电子证照，不同事项相同的申请材料无需重复提交，能通过共享获取的材料，不再要求提供纸质版，简化办事流程，减轻申请人负担。
南宁市从企业实际需求出发，将个体工商户转型为企业变更登记、税务变更登记（申领发票）、印章刻制备案、社保单位参保登记或参保信息变更、医保单位参保登记或参保信息变更、住房公积金缴存登记、银行基本账户开立预约信息或信息变更预约等事项进行集成办理，建立个体工商户转型为企业“一件事”跨部门联动办理机制。各部门协同配合，按照“一窗受理、内部流转、并联办理”模式，提供全方位服务。
基于广西数字政务一体化平台，南宁市依托广西企业开办“一窗通”平台，建立个体工商户转型为企业“一件事”集成联办服务专区（以下简称“个转企”专区）。申请人通过“个转企”专区向企业登记机关提出申请，登记完成后，结果信息即时推送至公安、税务、社保、医保、公积金、银行等部门机构，相关部门共享并认可变更登记信息，同步办理相关业务。整个流程个体工商户只需进行一次网上变更登记，即可完成多项业务，无需重复申请，真正实现“一网通办”。
南宁市市场监管局按照“合法、精简、高效、便捷”原则，牵头编制《个体工商户转型为企业“一件事”办理流程图》《个体工商户转型为企业“一件事”材料清单》，强化部门间业务、系统协同与信息共享，线上实现“一网通办、一次办、零跑动”，线下做到“一窗通办、一次提交、只跑一次”。办理结果支持一次领取或寄递服务，有效减少材料、环节、时间和跑动次数。",2025-04-17T01:16:15.760+03:00,https://finance.sina.cn/2025-04-17/detail-inetmkhe2715672.d.html?vt=4&cid=76729&node_id=76729,sina_mobile,positive

"辽宁自贸试验区深耕八年见""丰景""_手机新浪网","辽宁自贸试验区深耕八年见“丰景”
转自：辽宁日报
本报讯 记者董翰博报道 一片改革开放“试验田”经过精心耕作、悉心管护，正在收获累累果实，培育“良种”的经验也在向更大范围推广。辽宁自贸试验区建设运营8年来，实际利用外资累计50亿美元，外贸进出口额突破1万亿元。2024年，28项创新经验在全省复制推广，其中1项创新经验在全国复制推广；外贸进出口额达1543.7亿元，同比增长22%，其中通过制度创新推动外贸新增量达230亿元。
建设自由贸易试验区是党中央在新时代推进改革开放的重要战略举措。2017年4月辽宁自贸试验区揭牌成立至今，建设运营已有8年。这一平台在制度创新方面探索了哪些新途径、积累了哪些新经验？经营主体有何获得感？4月16日，省商务厅及辽宁自贸试验区沈阳片区、大连片区、营口片区的相关负责人在省政府新闻办召开的新闻发布会上对社会普遍关注的问题作介绍、解答。
省商务厅相关负责人表示，8年来，全省上下全面落实党中央、国务院关于自贸试验区建设的战略部署，推动自贸试验区提质增效，以制度创新为核心，立足创新推动制度型开放、创新带动外贸高质量增长、创新推动全产业链发展、创新推动区域联动发展四方面重点，各项工作取得积极成果。
自贸试验区是深层次改革的排头兵、高水平开放的引领者。8年来，我省坚持创新推动制度型开放。在参与国内、国际标准制定方面，2024年辽宁自贸试验区积极对接国际高标准，共计推出4项改革创新经验在全省复制推广。
贸易便利化是自贸试验区的发力重点。我省进行一系列探索，创新带动外贸高质量增长。比如，我省推出中欧班列综保区前站式集拼、中欧班列“多点集发”海关监管等系列创新模式。2024年，中欧班列进出口货值16.8亿元，同比增长13%。开展跨境电商零售进口“便捷监管”、跨境出口商品清单布控自动分拣等模式。2024年，辽宁自贸试验区跨境电商进出口额达68.1亿元，同比增长39.8%。
推动产业高质量发展是自贸试验区制度创新的重要目标。多年来，辽宁自贸试验区一直在围绕重点产业培育加强部署，创新推动全产业链发展。经过8年的开拓创新，辽宁自贸试验区初步构建了以汽车及零部件、航空装备、生物可降解材料等主导产业为支撑的产业体系。2024年，辽宁自贸试验区工业产值达1315亿元。沈阳片区形成了央地合作打造航空产业集群等多项创新成果，聚集了沈飞民机、南航沈阳维修基地等30余家航空制造与维修的骨干企业。大连片区形成了进出口车辆运输降本增效工作新举措等多项创新成果，聚集了东风日产、奇瑞汽车两大整车厂以及一批汽车零部件配套企业。营口片区形成了科技创新型企业“靶向培育”新机制等多项创新成果，聚集了东盛集团等规模以上新材料企业30家。
自贸试验区联动发展是统筹深层次改革和高水平开放的内在要求。“2024年以来，我省持续强化自贸试验区与重点产业园区联动创新发展，成果不断涌现。”省商务厅相关负责人举例，沈阳片区与大连片区联合试点进口食品《入境货物检验检疫证明》（以下简称《证明》）电子化互认，解决了企业往返海关开具纸质《证明》等问题，截至2024年年底，共签发《证明》2.8万份、食品《证明》近2万份，为企业节省了大量运营成本。
省商务厅相关负责人表示，今年辽宁自贸试验区将深入实施自贸试验区提升战略，更好发挥辽宁自贸试验区示范引领作用。谋划制定辽宁自贸试验区提升战略实施方案或重点任务清单，积极推进大连片区整合提升；开展首创性、集成式探索，持续推动沈阳片区开展飞机保税维修业务，促进国际艺术品产业创新发展，深化大连片区大宗商品贸易制度创新，建立出口汽车“出厂即入港、入港即退税、报备即出口”物流新模式，支持营口片区陆港枢纽产业园、绿色包装产业园建设。",2025-04-17T01:16:37.261+03:00,https://finance.sina.cn/2025-04-17/detail-inetmkha6205036.d.html?vt=4&cid=76729&node_id=76729,sina_mobile,positive
开局良好 彰显强大韧性潜力_手机新浪网,"开局良好 彰显强大韧性潜力
国家统计局4月16日发布数据，今年一季度，我国国内生产总值（GDP）318758亿元，同比增长5.4%。
今年是“十四五”规划收官之年。面对复杂严峻的外部环境，以习近平同志为核心的党中央团结带领全国各族人民沉着应变、综合施策，国民经济实现良好开局，长期向好的发展大势没有改变。
起步平稳 延续回升向好态势
国家统计局副局长盛来运在16日举行的国新办新闻发布会上说，一季度，随着各项宏观政策继续发力显效，国民经济起步平稳、开局良好，延续回升向好态势。
观察经济运行稳不稳，主要看四大宏观指标，即经济增长、就业、物价和国际收支状况。
从经济增长看，一季度GDP同比增长5.4%，增速高于去年全年5%的增速，也高于去年一季度5.3%的增速，在全球主要经济体中名列前茅，延续了稳中向好、稳中回升的态势。
从就业和物价看，同期，全国城镇调查失业率平均值为5.3%。其中，3月份全国城镇调查失业率为5.2%，比上月下降0.2个百分点。一季度，全国居民消费价格指数（CPI）同比下降0.1%，但扣除食品和能源的核心CPI同比上涨0.3%，保持温和上涨。
再看国际收支。3月末，我国外汇储备规模为32407亿美元，比上月末增加134亿美元，连续16个月稳定在3.2万亿美元以上。
从生产端和需求端观察，经济增长稳中有升的态势明显。
一季度，全国规模以上工业增加值同比增长6.5%，比上年全年加快0.7个百分点；服务业增加值同比增长5.3%，比上年全年加快0.3个百分点；社会消费品零售总额同比增长4.6%，比上年全年加快1.1个百分点；全国固定资产投资（不含农户）同比增长4.2%，比上年全年加快1个百分点。
社会预期持续改善，市场活力和信心有所增强。一季度，民间投资由上年全年下降转为同比增长0.4%。中国中小企业协会发布的数据显示，一季度中小企业发展指数为89.5，较去年四季度上升0.5点。3月份，制造业采购经理指数（PMI）为50.5%，比上月上升0.3个百分点，连续两个月扩张。
今年以来，国际环境变乱交织，不利影响加深，国内结构调整阵痛仍在释放，不少企业经营比较困难。面对复杂严峻的国内外环境，中国经济攻坚克难，成绩的取得来之不易。
“一季度经济开局良好，高质量发展向新向好，彰显了中国经济强大的韧性和潜力。”盛来运说。
中国经济发展韧性的背后，离不开政策的保驾护航。
在消费品以旧换新政策拉动下，一季度，限额以上单位通讯器材类商品零售额同比增长26.9%，文化办公用品类增长21.7%，家用电器和音像器材类增长19.3%，家具类增长18.1%，仅这四项就拉动社会消费品零售总额增长1.4个百分点。
今年以来，地方新增专项债发行提速，带动了到位资金的改善和项目的推进。一季度，新增专项债累计发行量接近1万亿元，固定资产投资本年实际到位资金同比增长3.7%，去年全年为下降2.3%。基础设施投资同比增长5.8%，比上年全年加快1.4个百分点。
“在充分肯定成绩的同时，我们也清醒地看到，当前外部环境更趋复杂严峻，全球贸易保护主义快速升温，世界经济秩序受到重创，国内结构转型任务仍然比较繁重。”盛来运说，持续推动经济回升向好，需要付出更加艰巨的努力。
向新向好 积蓄高质量发展新动能
细看首季成绩单，中国经济在实现“量”的合理增长的同时，“进”的步伐更加稳健，创新引领作用持续增强，发展新动能加快培育壮大。
“从统计数据情况来看，‘五个维度’反映出今年一季度新质生产力加快培育壮大，高质量发展继续取得新成效。”盛来运说。
创新持续推进。人工智能、量子科技等一批先进技术的推出和应用，带动了高技术产业发展。一季度，规模以上高技术制造业增加值同比增长9.7%，信息传输、软件和信息技术服务业增加值增长10.3%，创新动力不断增强。
协调发展持续改善。一季度，规模以上装备制造业占规模以上工业的比重达33.7%，同比提高1.9个百分点；高技术制造业的占比达15.7%，提高0.5个百分点，工业向高端化、智能化、绿色化转型的趋势明显。
高水平开放继续推进。目前，我国已与世界上150多个国家和地区成为贸易伙伴。今年一季度，对共建“一带一路”国家的出口同比增长7.2%，货物进出口额占全部进出口额比重超过50%，多元化市场格局正在形成。
绿色转型、绿色发展扎实推进。以新能源汽车、锂电池、光伏为代表的新能源产业继续保持较高增长速度。一季度，非化石能源消费占能源消费总量的比重比上年同期提升了1.5个百分点。
民生改善和安全发展继续取得新进展。就业形势总体稳定，居民收入增长与经济增长基本同步，能源保供有力有效，化解地方债、中小金融机构、房地产等风险的政策积极有效，安全发展得到加强。
锚定高质量发展首要任务不动摇，中国始终保持战略定力，奋楫向前、向“新”求“质”，立足国内大市场、做强国内大循环——
宇树机器人惊艳“亮相”、DeepSeek引领人工智能大模型发展潮流……今年以来，高水平创新成果竞相涌现，科教融汇、产教融合推动高校科研成果加快转化为现实生产力。最新发布的《国家创新指数报告2024》显示，我国创新能力综合排名居世界第10位。
“中国的创新正不断给世界带来惊喜。”西门子股份公司董事会主席博乐仁在上个月参加中国发展高层论坛2025年年会时说，面对增长从何而来的难题，中国已经给出了答案：以高技术、高效能，追求高质量的增长。
从中国发展高层论坛2025年年会到博鳌亚洲论坛2025年年会、2025中关村论坛年会，“创新”已经成为全球工商界代表观察中国的共同话题。
脱口秀、演唱会、舞台剧持续升温，急救培训、AI课程、厨艺缝纫等“夜校”成上班族新宠，“赏花+”新业态不断上新，各类新品首发首秀精彩纷呈……今年以来，消费新动能持续释放。一季度，社会消费品零售总额近12.5万亿元，消费在政策的推动下持续改善。
“无论国际形势如何变化，我们都要坚定信心、保持定力，坚定不移推动高质量发展，以中国高质量发展的确定性来应对外部变化的不确定性。”盛来运说。
有底气、有信心、有能力应对外部挑战
美加征关税对中国经济的影响有多大？中国能否实现5%左右的经济增速预期目标？
“从短期来看，美国加征高额关税会对我国经济和外贸带来一定压力，但是改变不了中国经济长期向好的发展大势。”盛来运说，中国经济基础稳、优势多、韧性强、潜力大，我们有底气、有信心、有能力应对外部挑战，实现既定发展目标。
随着中国经济转型升级的持续推进，原来依靠投资和出口带动的发展模式发生了改变，依靠内需和创新驱动共同推动经济增长的新格局正在形成。
过去五年，三大需求中内需对经济增长的平均贡献率超过80%。2024年，以新产业、新业态、新商业模式为核心内容的“三新”经济增加值占我国GDP的比重约为18%。
首季中国经济成绩单上一组组数字，凸显了中国经济的强大韧性和潜力——
在世界经济增长动能不足、贸易保护主义加剧以及地缘政治紧张因素较多的情况下，一季度，我国货物贸易进出口10.3万亿元，同比增长1.3%。其中，出口6.13万亿元，增长6.9%。
一季度，服务零售额同比增长5%，比同期商品零售额增速高0.4个百分点。与消费结构升级相关的消费增长更快，保持两位数增长。居民人均服务性消费支出同比增长5.4%，占全部居民人均消费支出的比重达到43.4%，比去年同期提高0.1个百分点。
“中国有14亿多人口，市场规模巨大，现在人均GDP超过1.3万美元，正处在消费升级的关键阶段，市场成长性好，无论是投资还是消费空间都非常大，将支撑中国经济持续发展。”盛来运说。
面对严峻复杂的外部环境，中国坚定不移办好自己的事，与各方做大互利共赢蛋糕，为全球经济注入稳定性和确定性——
从《关于建立健全涉企收费长效监管机制的指导意见》到《关于健全社会信用体系的意见》，今年以来，一系列政策文件接连出台，重点领域和关键环节改革持续攻坚，为中国经济打开新空间。
消博会、广交会接连举办，中国张开双臂迎接八方来客，与全球共享市场机遇，建设更高水平开放型经济新体制，同各国共同促进自由贸易，实现互利共赢。
在风雨洗礼中成长，在历经考验中壮大，中国积累了丰富的宏观调控经验。
“针对当前的外部变化，中央经济工作会议进行充分预判，宏观政策更加积极有为，及时推出更加积极的财政政策和适度宽松的货币政策。”盛来运说，从一季度来看，政策效应持续显现，对推动国民经济实现良好开局发挥了重要作用。下阶段，会根据外部形势的变化及时推出增量政策，丰富的政策“工具箱”是应对外部冲击和挑战的保障。
中国经济是一片大海，而不是一个小池塘。
应对有经验、政策有保障、制度有优势、市场有潜力、企业有活力，坚韧不拔的中国经济，必将在风雨后更加茁壮。

Wisconsin beats Minnesota in voter turnout | MPR News,"In the race between Gophers and Badgers for voter turnout, the Badgers won.
Voters in Wisconsin narrowly outperformed Minnesota voters in the 2024 election. The University of Florida’s Election Lab reported that 76.35 percent of the voting-eligible population cast ballots in Minnesota. In Wisconsin, 76.64 percent of the voting-eligible population cast ballots.
Secretary of State Steve Simon regularly touts Minnesota’s long-running first place voter turnout position. And he said while turnout was strong in the 2024 general election, it came up just a little bit short.
“In a heartbreakingly close contest, Minnesota lost the title of number one in voter turnout to Wisconsin for the 2024 election,” Simon said in a statement. “We congratulate our neighbors to the east on this victory and we’ll continue our work to earn the top spot back in 2026.”
Wisconsin was one of a handful of battleground states in last year’s presidential election. Campaigns spent tens of millions of dollars in Wisconsin and voters sent a mixed message back by reelecting Republican President Donald Trump and Democratic U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin.
Minnesota stayed in the Democratic column. Former Vice President Kamala Harris won the presidential vote in Minnesota with Gov. Tim Walz on the ticket. DFL Sen. Amy Klobuchar easily defeated her Republican opponent.",2025-04-17T00:05:00.000+03:00,https://www.mprnews.org/story/2025/04/16/wisconsin-beats-minnesota-in-voter-turnout,Clay Masters,positive
超500亿件！快递折射中国经济动能 _ 东方财富网,"4月15日，国家邮政局公布2025年一季度邮政行业运行情况，一季度，快递业务量同比增长21.6%，快递业务收入同比增长10.9%。截至目前，今年我国快递业务量已超500亿件，比2024年提前了18天。这意味着，全国人均收到快递35件，每秒有5700多件快递、每天有5亿件快递在神州大地穿梭流动。
　　快递业不仅是消费市场繁荣的“晴雨表”，更是国民经济高质量发展的“助推器”。国家邮政局发展研究中心战略规划研究部主任刘江表示，今年以来，快递业继续保持稳健发展，反映出我国消费市场持续升温、消费潜力加速释放。未来，随着促消费政策持续落地和行业发展新动能逐步壮大，快递业将进一步发挥在物流领域的重要作用，助力畅通经济循环和提升实体经济运行效率，为经济高质量发展注入更强动能。
　　 业务范围稳步拓展
　　“早上打包，中午寄出，48小时内就能送达北上广。”云南省保山市隆阳区潞江镇芒旦村咖啡种植户周永奇告诉记者，自从快递网点设到村里，他家的咖啡豆就不愁卖了，销售范围迅速扩大至全国。
　　 中通快递 保山网点负责人杨华告诉记者，最近咖啡产品发货量很大，尤其是挂耳咖啡和咖啡豆，日均发货量达7000件。目前， 中通快递 通过“地头设点、区域包片、驻厂揽收”综合服务链，为保山当地近百家咖啡种植户与生产商提供寄递服务，一季度咖啡豆发货量超58万件。
　　快递业一头关乎民生，一头牵引发展。云南省邮政管理局副局长荣蓉介绍，近年来 农产品 上行步伐不断加快，“空中松茸”“高铁鲜花”等方式加速“云品”出滇，有力促进城乡资源要素流动，提高农村消费便捷性。今年1月至2月，云南省快递业务量同比增长37.17%，日均处理邮件快件近1600万件，快递业务收入同比增长22.82%，增速位居全国前列。
　　今年以来，快递业继续保持稳健发展，反映出我国消费市场持续升温、消费潜力加速释放。快递企业持续深耕 农产品 市场，有效满足多场景寄递需求，寄递业务范围稳步拓展。
　　无锡马拉松、石家庄马拉松、嘉兴马拉松……随着天气转暖，多地马拉松赛事鸣枪开跑。针对马拉松选手的寄递需求， 京东 物流、顺丰等企业纷纷布局赛事物流，通过创新仓储模式、提供个性化增值服务等方式全力保障马拉松赛事物资运输平稳有序。
　　在上海马拉松赛场，选手们可将参赛使用的衣服、跑鞋交给快递员，通过“ 京东 服务+”的洗衣工厂洗净后再寄回家；在武汉马拉松赛场，顺丰速运联合锦江之星推出“汉马专属住宿计划”，为外地跑者提供行李“门到门”配送服务，选手入住后行李可一键寄送返程。
　　国家邮政局相关负责人表示，今年以来，一系列促消费政策落地显效，消费市场总体呈现平稳增长态势，消费场景不断丰富，带动了快递市场规模持续扩增。同时，邮政快递业不断延伸服务网络、创新服务产品、提升服务品质，进一步满足多元化消费需求。
　　 寄递服务更加高效
　　眼下，春茶采摘迎来高峰。在河南省信阳市浉河区文新茶村，顺丰速运丰舟90物流 无人机 搭载着首批信阳毛尖的春茶鲜叶腾空而起，10分钟后，这批茶叶顺利进入山脚下的茶场进行炒制。
　　“为了破解春茶鲜叶‘最初一公里’运输痛点，除了空 中无人机 ，地面还部署了顺丰R5无人车，可实现海拔800米以上陡坡茶园全天候接驳，形成‘空中快线+地面支线’的立体运输网络。”顺丰速运河南区域副总经理郭伟介绍，茶农以前运鲜叶下山最怕堵车，晚1个小时，茶叶清香度就不一样，品质和口感就会差很多。现在组合运输，能将单程运输时间由传统陆运的90分钟压缩至15分钟，大大提升信阳茶产业的物流效率。茶农周建国告诉记者，单日通过“ 无人机 +无人车”联运体系运输2400斤鲜叶，成本节省超1100元。
　　作为 农产品 上行的重要渠道，邮政快递业在降低农产品流通成本、提升农产品流通效率等方面发挥着重要作用。邮政、快递企业积极探索“共同配送”“客货邮”等融合发展模式，因地制宜完善县、乡、村三级寄递物流网络节点建设。比如，青海省大通县利用公交车辆富余空间，将邮政、快递企业的包裹交由城乡公交车辆代运，引导和支持相关电商、农特产品企业入驻交通运输场站，共享场站资源。
　　旅游市场火热也推动快递企业持续创新服务模式，便利百姓出行。在兰州中川国际机场，顺丰速运联合甘肃省民航航空物流有限责任公司推出“行李打包、寄存及快递”一体化服务，为旅客带来“零等待、全场景”航空寄递新体验；在贵州黔东南地区， 申通快递 贵州凯里网点通过科技赋能和定制化包装服务，保障苗族银饰和侗族蜡染非遗产品安全寄递，助力民族文化传播。
　　“得益于行业积极创新服务模式，在多场景部署应用 人工智能 大模型，在多区域投用智能设备，服务质效持续增强。”刘江说。
　　 持续推动降本增效
　　最新发布的3月中国快递发展指数报告显示，3月，快递发展趋势指数为72.1，同比提升5.4%。4月，春菜、春果大量上市，踏青旅游热情提升，预计相关寄递服务将迎来新发展。
　　一方面，随着消费品以旧换新政策加力扩围，数码、家电、厨卫等产品持续热销。为更好服务政策落地实施，邮政、快递企业积极响应，推出系列专属寄递服务方案，发展逆向物流网络，将送新货、拆旧品、安装调试和环保回收融为一体，构建起高效便捷的一体化服务体系。
　　另一方面，随着智能物流港持续建设，寄递服务能力进一步增强。前不久， 京东 物流新疆喀什仓试运营，依托喀什、乌鲁木齐等仓网布局，喀什市及其周边多地将实现最快当日达，其他地区整体时效较以往乌鲁木齐直发提速3天。 京东物流 相关负责人表示，未来， 京东物流 新疆仓网还将引入自主研发的现代化智能物流软硬件设施设备，持续打造现代化供应链体系。
　　快递业作为现代流通体系的重要组成部分，是推动提升流通效率、降低物流成本的前沿阵地。
　　“物流领域降本增效还有较大的改善空间。”刘江认为，首先，要发挥行业规模经济优势，提高网络覆盖率和服务便捷性，通过规模经济效应降低行业平均运行成本，继续提升性价比；其次，要高效连通生产消费，减少流通环节，推动生产与消费直连，实现农特产品从田间直达餐桌，工业品从生产线直达快递分拣线，将寄递网络打造为制造业“移动仓”，提高仓库周转效率；再次，要加快流通方式升级，带动物流质量变革、效率变革和动力变革，推动 物流行业 现代化和智能化发展，重点发展零库存管理、生产线边物流等新型业务，实现信息互联互通和链条高效整合；最后，丰富垂直领域大模型应用场景，以“ 人工智能 +”更好促进数实融合，以“数智化”更好赋能产业链整合，提升全产业链价值。

'I finally get a chance to go': Vietnam veteran shares excitement for Triad Honor Flight,"Greensboro Marine has waited 5 years to go on Triad Honor Flight, says it celebrates military legacy
In exactly two weeks from Wednesday, some of our country's bravest will be experiencing the next Triad Honor Flight.
WXII spoke with one Marine who has been waiting five years for this opportunity. He said for him and many of his peers, the Triad Honor Flight is a very deep and impactful way to honor the legacies of generations of men and women in uniform, giving them the respect they may not have received upon their initial return.
""When we came back, it was a years and years before I even let anybody know I had been in the military,"" said Haywood Miller.
Miller was just 19 years old when he was sent to Vietnam, serving in the Marines from 1967-1973. He’s a survivor of the U.S.S. Forrestal disaster, one of the worst losses of life on a U.S. Navy ship in American history. That experience and more was something he kept to himself for quite a while.
""Nobody that I met after I got out the military knew I was in the military,"" he said. ""But now I'm wide open. Anybody else, and they see me, they know I've been in there.""
It’s why he’s looking forward to Triad Honor Flight’s eighth trip to Washington, D.C.
""I've been waiting since 2020, so I'm glad and excited to get in here,"" he said. ""I finally get a chance to go.
Executive Director Alison Huber says their mission is to honor every veteran they can, a mission that gets more and more important with each passing flight.
""The cards and the letters and the calls that we receive after is almost more meaningful,"" she said. ""It's the veteran that calls and says, 'I just can't thank you enough. I've had healing because of this experience.'""
This upcoming flight’s cohort will feature a large group of veterans under the age of 100, and many who are Purple Heart recipients. Huber said it does not matter how many times they make this flight, each one is memorable and unique in its own way.
Hundreds of volunteers and hundreds of hours of planning go into making each Triad Honor Flight a success. That includes interviewing veterans, coordinating their guardians and tour guides, and, of course, preparing their flight.
Miller shared with us what he is looking forward to the most.
""I'm looking forward to going by the Vietnam Memorial and seeing a lot of my classmates' names up on that wall,"" he said. ""People I went to high school with, and people on the ship I was on when it blew up. Just going to see them, in remembrance of them.""
April 30 will be the nonprofit's first flight of this year.

The return of Russians from captivity in Gaza has been possible thanks to Russia's long-standing relations with the Palestinian people, Russian President Vladimir Putin said at a meeting with Alexander Trufanov, who was released from Gaza in February.
""The fact that you were restored to liberty is the result of Russia’s stable long-standing relations with the Palestinian people, their representatives, and various organizations,"" Putin said. ""I think we should express our gratitude to the leadership, the political wing of Hamas for agreeing to meet us halfway and performing this act, a humanitarian act of releasing you,"" he added.
""Of course, we will do everything to ensure that such acts are performed as often as possible and all the people who are still in those conditions, in which you have spent so much time - that they are also released,"" the Russian president emphasized.
""Thank God you are safe and sound, and here. Right now, I’m not going to give any political assessments to the current developments. But everything that has happened to you is a tragedy,"" he added, addressing Trufanov and his family members.
Gaza-based Palestinian radicals took Alexander Trufanov, his mother Yelena, grandmother Irina Tati and fiancee Sapir Cohen hostage in an attack on southern Israel on October 7, 2023. Alexander’s father Vitaly was killed. Yelena Trufanova, Tati and Cohen were freed in late November and early December 2023, while Alexander Trufanov was released in mid-February 2025.",2025-04-17T01:08:00.000+03:00,https://tass.com/politics/1944755,TASS,positive
"Chatt Prep avoids charter revocation, moves forward under probationary status","Chatt Prep avoids charter revocation, moves forward under probationary status
CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. (WDEF) — Following several weeks of review and collaboration, Hamilton County Schools and the new leadership at Chattanooga Prep have reached an agreement regarding the schools charter status.
Superintendent Dr. Justin Robertson initially recommended revoking the school’s charter.
However, after working closely with Chattanooga Prep’s administration, he decided to allow the school to continue operating while addressing key compliance issues.
The probationary status does not impact accreditation or daily operations.
To maintain compliance, the school must complete several corrective actions, including:
- Provide Course Verification for students in grades 6-11 and provide additional evidence that all standards within the course have been taught and assessed for all current students.
- Provide Proof of Insurance Coverage to ensure no gap in coverage will occur.
- Update PowerSchool to accurately reflect the Teacher of Record. If an administrator is listed as the Teacher of Record, provide an explanation of how the administrator is teaching the course while also serving in the administrator role.
Corrective actions that are have already been completed or underway include:
- Verification and updating of teacher licensures and certifications.
- A thorough audit of students’ transcripts to ensure timely graduation or promotion for all students who were believed to be on track.
- Revision of HR procedures to ensure proper hiring, evaluation, and documentation practices.
- Ongoing collaboration with Chattanooga Prep, HCS, and legal and education consultants",2025-04-17T00:06:00.000+03:00,https://www.wdef.com/chatt-prep-avoids-charter-revocation-moves-forward-under-probationary-status,Rainey Randolph,positive
Unifesp corrige identificação de desaparecido político da ditadura,"Unifesp corrige identificação de desaparecido político da ditadura
A identificação realizada por legistas da Universidade Estadual de Campinas (Unicamp) em 1991 e que havia apontado que os remanescentes ósseos encontrados na vala clandestina do Cemitério Dom Bosco, na capital paulista, pertenciam a Denis Casemiro estava incorreta. Isso é o que apontou um novo exame feito com base em compatibilidade genética e que foi realizado por pesquisadores da Universidade Federal de São Paulo (Unifesp).
É + que streaming. É arte, cultura e história.
Em cerimônia realizada no final da manhã desta quarta-feira (16), na reitoria da Unifesp, em São Paulo, os pesquisadores revelaram o erro na identificação, que tinha sido a primeira de um desaparecido político da vala clandestina de Perus.
Ontem, a Comissão de Mortos e Desaparecidos Políticos e a Unifesp haviam anunciado que conseguiram identificar os restos mortais de mais dois desaparecidos políticos que foram sepultados por agentes da ditadura militar na vala clandestina de Perus. Um deles era Grenaldo de Jesus Silva. O outro, Denis Casemiro.
Analisando os remanescentes ósseos que foram encontrados na vala de Perus, os pesquisadores identificaram novos restos mortais que eram compatíveis com Denis Casemiro. Isso foi possível por meio de um exame que compara as mais de 1 mil ossadas encontradas na vala com o DNA de familiares dos desaparecidos políticos da ditadura. Outro processo que auxiliou na identificação correta foi a marca de uma lesão que foi observada nesses remanescentes ósseos e que era compatível à marca de um tiro que a vítima havia sofrido nos ossos das costelas.
Depois que perceberam que havia essa compatibilidade genética, os pesquisadores decidiram acionar a Justiça para exumar os restos mortais que haviam sido sepultados décadas antes como sendo dele já que, nos exames feitos em 1991, ainda não existia o teste de DNA.
“Nossa equipe analisou aqueles remanescentes ósseos. Coletamos amostras para fazer o exame de DNA e o enviamos para um laboratório internacional. O resultado mostrou que essa pessoa não tinha vínculo genético com a família Casemiro. Esses remanescentes foram depois comparados ao de outras famílias de desaparecidos políticos e não houve também correspondência”, explicou Samuel Ferreira, pesquisador e membro do projeto de Análise dos Remanescentes Ósseos da Vala Clandestina de Perus.
“O conjunto que havia sido sepultado em 1991, como sendo do Denis Casemiro, não era, de fato, de Denis Casemiro e também não é de nenhum desaparecido político”, confirmou o pesquisador.
Desaparecidos políticos
A vala clandestina de Perus foi descoberta no início dos anos 90. No local, foram encontradas 1.049 ossadas sem identificação de vítimas de esquadrões da morte, indigentes e também de presos políticos. Acredita-se que, desse total de ossadas, pelo menos 42 se tratem de desaparecidos políticos da ditadura militar, que foram sepultados no local como indigentes.
O projeto desenvolvido atualmente pela Unifesp para identificação dessas ossadas conta com uma amostra de material genético de 34 famílias de desaparecidos políticos. Foi esse material genético que permitiu que, em 2018, Dimas Antônio Casemiro, irmão de Denis, também pudesse ser identificado.
Em entrevista à Agência Brasil, o coordenador do Centro de Antropologia e Arqueologia Forense (CAAF) da Unifesp, Edson Teles, afirmou que ainda não é possível dizer o que provocou o erro na identificação feita em 1991.

“Certamente a gente vai ser se dedicar um pouco para entender isso”, disse ele. “Eu não sei exatamente qual foi o processo que levou ao erro. É claro que, do ponto de vista tecnológico, hoje a gente tem, por exemplo, o exame genético que propícia mais objetividade e possibilidade de obter um resultado correto. Mas, naquela época, as técnicas também conseguiam obter resultados positivos corretos. Para além da identificação do Denis, a gente sabe que a Unicamp também não tratou corretamente daquelas ossadas”, ressaltou.
Com esses dois novos casos, já são seis os desaparecidos políticos enterrados no Cemitério Dom Bosco e que tiveram seus restos mortais identificados: Frederico Eduardo Mayr (1992); Flávio Carvalho Molina (2005); Dimas Antônio Casemiro (2018); Aluísio Palhano Pedreira Ferreira (2018); Denis Casemiro (2025) e Grenaldo de Jesus Silva (2025).
Quem foram Denis e Grenaldo
“Era uma vez dois rapazes. Um nascido em 1941 e, o outro, em 1942. Um nasceu em São Luís do Maranhão. O outro nasceu no interior de São Paulo. Os dois tinham sonho. Um sonho de maior igualdade e de maior justiça social, para que as pessoas pobres fossem bem tratadas e fossem mais felizes”, descreveu Eugênia Augusta Gonzaga, presidente da Comissão Especial sobre Mortos e Desaparecidos Políticos.
“Os dois foram enterrados no fatídico cemitério de Perus, construído pelos governos municipal e estadual daquela época, em conluio com a ditadura, para descartar corpos. E, não satisfeitos, ainda fizeram uma vala para exumar aqueles corpos que haviam sido enterrados há mais de três anos e colocaram todos eles numa comum. Essa é a vala de Perus, que foi descoberta pela luta incessante dos familiares das vítimas”, disse ela.
Coletiva de imprensa na UNIFESP apresenta identificação das ossadas de ossadas de Denis Casemiro e Grenaldo de Jesus Silva Paulo Pinto/Agência Brasil
Denis Casemiro nasceu em Votuporanga (SP). Foi pedreiro e trabalhador rural e atuou politicamente na Vanguarda Popular Revolucionária (VPR). Foi preso em abril de 1971, torturado e executado pela equipe do Departamento de Ordem Política e Social (DOPS), coordenada pelo delegado Sérgio Fleury. Na época de sua morte, foram forjadas versões de tentativas de fuga que ""resultaram em sua morte"".
Já Grenaldo era um militar da Marinha brasileira, nascido em São Luís (MA). Ele foi preso em 1964 e expulso da instituição enquanto reivindicava melhores condições de trabalho. Chegou a fugir da prisão e viver na clandestinidade, mas foi morto em 30 de maio de 1972 ao tentar capturar uma aeronave no aeroporto de Congonhas, em São Paulo (SP). Documentos do Instituto Médico Legal (IML) registraram que Grenaldo teria sido sepultado em 1º de junho de 1972 no Cemitério Dom Bosco como ""indigente"", e constava como desaparecido até ter seus remanescentes ósseos identificados pela equipe do Projeto Perus.
“Grenaldo foi um herói nacional, que lutou pela democracia e contra a ditadura”, disse Maria Amélia de Almeida Teles, a Amelinha, ex-presa política e representante da Comissão de Familiares de Mortos e Desaparecidos Políticos da Ditadura.
A fala de Amelinha foi dirigida especialmente ao filho de Grenaldo, que esteve presente na cerimônia realizada hoje. Acompanhado da filha e de sua esposa e bastante emocionado com a identificação dos restos mortais de seu pai, ele não quis conversar com a imprensa.
Para Amelinha, a busca ainda constante pelos desaparecidos políticos é também uma busca pela verdade histórica do país. “A verdade ainda está longe de acontecer. Mas essa identificação [dos restos mortais] é um passo importante”, ressaltou.
Memória e justiça
Os familiares de Grenaldo de Jesus Silva que estavam presentes à cerimônia de hoje foram abraçados no local pela ministra dos Direitos Humanos e Cidadania, Macaé Evaristo. Depois, em entrevista a jornalistas, a ministra destacou a importância desses reconhecimentos para a construção da verdade sobre aquele período histórico.
“Só se apropriando da verdade é que nós vamos recusar qualquer regime ditatorial. É preciso trazer à tona que a democracia é a melhor forma de vida em sociedade. Para isso, as pessoas têm que ter direito à liberdade e à sua liberdade de expressão e tem que ter instituições fortes que precisam ser respeitadas. Ninguém pode ser assassinado em função da sua crença ou do seu ideário político”, destacou.
Para a ministra, as novas identificações feitas pela equipe de pesquisadores da Unifesp demonstram que essa técnica pode também ser utilizada para outras violências causadas pelo Estado.
“Acho que a gente dá um passo importante com essas duas identificações porque aponta que é possível. Hoje, cada vez mais, estamos nos apropriando dessa tecnologia que vai servir tanto para os casos de mortos desaparecidos no contexto da ditadura militar quanto para outros casos que a gente tem de desaparecidos no país”.

Para a procuradora regional da República, Eugênia Augusta Gonzaga, que preside a Comissão Especial sobre Mortos e Desaparecidos Políticos, a vala clandestina de Perus é o maior exemplo da truculência da ditadura militar no Brasil.
“O Brasil está precisando de identificações. O Brasil está precisando dessa memória e dessa verdade. Por mais que a ditadura tenha mentido que essas pessoas não morreram em suas mãos e que essas pessoas simplesmente desapareceram, eu sempre digo, o DNA delas está ali na vala de Perus, que é a maior prova da truculência daquele período”, disse ela a durante cerimônia realizada hoje em São Paulo para anúncio das duas identificações.
“A história da vala de Perus está quase nada contada. Ainda falta exumarmos essa história”, completou o coordenador do CAAF Edson Teles. “É preciso que os trabalhos de identificação humana de pessoas desaparecidas se transformem em política pública perene, de modo que a gente não dependa de quem está em determinada carga de responsabilidade”, ressaltou.
Para ele, além da identificação dos desaparecidos políticos, também é necessário que os governos assumam o compromisso de construir espaços de memória e de guarda desses remanescentes ósseos. “A gente precisa que a prefeitura de São Paulo e outras instituições organizem e construam um memorial no Cemitério Dom Bosco que possa receber esses remanescentes que não tem identificação de volta e que a gente possa transformar esse memorial num lugar de memória e também num lugar de educação para os direitos humanos”.

Elon Musk's Net Worth Surges 100% Post-Election,"Elon Musk's Net Worth Surges 100% Post-Election
At the end of 2022, Elon Musk's net worth experienced a significant decline, losing over $200 billion. However, following the recent election victory, Musk, as the largest investor, saw a substantial increase in his net worth. As the spokesperson for Dogecoin, this development suggests that Dogecoin is poised for a potential surge.
This article delves into the process of cloud mining Dogecoin and other cryptocurrencies. Dogecoin cloud mining involves service providers receiving new Dogecoin rewards by verifying transactions on the Dogecoin blockchain. While this process may seem straightforward, it is quite complex. Multiple computers must process the same transaction [block] simultaneously, with only one computer receiving the new token reward. The node that earns the new token is the one that successfully adds the old transaction block to the new block, a task that requires solving intricate mathematical equations.
BlockchainCloudMining offers several advantages. It alleviates the financial burden of purchasing and maintaining expensive mining equipment. Cloud mining service providers can achieve profitability more quickly than individual miners. Additionally, BlockchainCloudMining supports a variety of cryptocurrency payment methods, including BTC, ETH, USDT-ERC20, LTC, BCH, USDT-TRC20, SOL, and DOGE. The service does not impose additional fees or management charges, and it features an affiliate program that allows users to earn up to 3% + 2% referral rewards, with potential bonuses of up to $50,000 per month. The platform ensures security through McAfee® and Cloudflare®, guarantees 100% uptime, and provides 24/7 technical support.
To engage in Dogecoin cloud mining, users should select a reliable BlockchainCloudMining service provider. Professional analysts and IT teams analyze the computing power generated by mining machines and replace them with the latest models to ensure higher returns. For those concerned about missing out on investment opportunities, now is an opportune time to join cloud mining before it becomes too competitive.
BlockchainCloudMining offers various high-yield contracts, including a New User Experience Contract with an investment of $100 for a 2-day period, yielding a total income of $100 + $6. Other contracts include the WhatsMiner M66S with a $500 investment for 7 days, yielding $500 + $40.25; the WhatsMiner M60 with a $1000 investment for 14 days, yielding $1000 + $168; the Bitcoin Miner S21 [xp imm] with a $5,000 investment for 32 days, yielding $5,000 + $2,048; and the ALPH Miner AL1 with a $10,000 investment for 45 days, yielding $10,000 + $6,075. The platform also offers stable income contracts, with more details available on the official website.
For beginners, joining Dogecoin mining is recommended as it allows for quicker mining of the first block of a new coin and fosters a sense of community, which is central to the Dogecoin ethos. For more information, visit the platform’s official website. The company can be contacted via email at info@blockchaincloudmining.com.

TrustBIX Inc.'s Stock Option Grant: A Strategic Move Amid Mixed Market Signals,"TrustBIX Inc.'s Stock Option Grant: A Strategic Move Amid Mixed Market Signals
TrustBIX Inc. (TSXV: TBIX), a Canadian agri-tech firm focused on sustainability solutions for the global food supply chain, recently announced a stock option grant to its directors, officers, employees, and consultants. The April 16, 2025, move allows the issuance of options to purchase up to 4,120,000 common shares at an exercise price of $0.05 per share, vesting in three equal tranches over two years. While the grant aligns with the company’s goal to incentivize stakeholders, its implications for investors hinge on the stock’s trajectory, the company’s financial health, and broader market dynamics.
Key Details of the Option Grant
The options granted on April 16 carry an exercise price of $0.05, which was 25% above the stock’s closing price of $0.04 on the same day. This structure ensures the options are out-of-the-money at issuance, meaning recipients will profit only if the stock price rises above $0.05. The vesting schedule—one-third immediately, followed by tranches on the first and second anniversaries—ties compensation to long-term performance, a move that could stabilize leadership and operational focus.
The grant forms part of TrustBIX’s existing stock option plan and complies with TSX Venture Exchange policies. However, the announcement arrives amid weak trading activity: only 4,055 shares traded on April 16, a stark contrast to prior days like April 9 (85,004 shares) or March 25 (287,300 shares). This suggests limited immediate investor reaction, possibly due to the stock’s volatility or lack of new operational updates.
Market Context: A Fragile Stock Price
On April 16, TrustBIX’s stock closed at $0.04, unchanged throughout the day. While the price reflected a +300% year-to-date (YTD) surge from its January 2025 lows, it had also declined -11.11% over the prior week, indicating instability. The $0.05 exercise price sits above this level, creating a hurdle for option holders.
Historically, TrustBIX’s stock has fluctuated between $0.03 and $0.045 in early 2025, with a peak of $0.045 on April 14 before stabilizing at $0.04. The company’s market capitalization stood at CAD 4.93 million as of April 16, underscoring its small-cap status and vulnerability to liquidity risks.
Financial Health and Risks
TrustBIX’s financials paint a cautionary picture. Its latest reported figures for the 2024 fiscal year (ended September 30, 2024) showed:
- Revenue: CAD 1.53 million (down from CAD 2.13 million in 2023).
- Net Loss: CAD 2.21 million (an improvement from CAD 3.07 million in 2023).
- Going Concern Qualification: Auditors raised doubts about the company’s ability to continue as a viable entity, citing reliance on future financing.
The company’s negative P/E ratio (-3.21x in 2024) and high debt levels (CAD 401,000 net debt) further highlight liquidity challenges. While TrustBIX emphasizes growth in blockchain traceability and vertical farming, its operational execution remains unproven at scale.
Strategic Implications
The stock option grant signals TrustBIX’s commitment to retaining talent and aligning stakeholder incentives. However, the $0.05 exercise price serves as a de facto price target for management. For the options to become valuable, the stock must rise above this threshold—a challenge given the company’s financial struggles and volatile trading.
The grant’s structure—three-year expiration and staggered vesting—also introduces a timeline for accountability. If TrustBIX’s stock fails to appreciate, the options may expire worthless, leaving stakeholders unfulfilled. Conversely, sustained growth in its agri-tech solutions could create upside potential.
Conclusion
TrustBIX’s stock option grant balances strategic ambition with inherent risks. While the out-of-the-money pricing aligns management and employees’ interests with shareholder value, the company’s weak financials and volatile stock price pose significant hurdles. Key questions remain:
- Can TrustBIX stabilize its revenue? Its 2024 revenue dropped 28% year-over-year, and the ""Going Concern"" warning demands urgent cash flow improvements.
- Will the stock breach $0.05? Historical trends show TrustBIX’s price has struggled to hold above $0.04, with a 1-month decline of -11.11% as of April 16.
- What catalysts exist? The company’s next earnings release (May 27, 2025) and progress in IoT or blockchain projects could influence sentiment.
For investors, the grant offers a conditional upside but requires patience and tolerance for risk. TrustBIX’s CAD 4.93 million market cap and 300% YTD surge suggest speculation is already priced in. Until the stock surpasses $0.05 and financial metrics improve, the grant remains a gamble on unproven execution.
In summary, TrustBIX’s move underscores its ambition to grow, but investors must weigh its aggressive incentives against its fragile fundamentals. The road ahead is fraught with challenges, but the options’ structure creates a clear path to success—if the company can deliver.",2025-04-17T01:18:46.720+03:00,https://www.ainvest.com/news/trustbix-stock-option-grant-strategic-move-mixed-market-signals-2504,Clyde Morgan,positive

En el trayecto por una de las principales avenidas del centro de la ciudad de Aguascalientes participaron miles personas con el objetivo de reiterar la importancia que representan la tauromaquia, la charrería y las peleas de gallos como parte fundamental de la Feria Nacional de San Marcos.
Durante la exposición de motivos en el Pleno del Congreso Local, diputados de las distintas bancadas políticas destacaron la importancia que tiene la Feria Nacional de San Marcos como motor de la economía y como parte esencial de las actividades artísticas y culturales que dan identidad a los aguascalentenses.
Se señaló que estas actividades representan una importante fuente de empleo y son parte fundamental de la verbena, generando solo durante la temporada de feria una derrama económica cercana a los 9 mil millones de pesos, la generación de 12 mil empleos, así como el arribo de 8 millones de visitantes cada año.
Al votar a favor de este dictamen, los Legisladores locales aseguran la preservación de la Feria Nacional de San Marcos y así como de las tradiciones que son parte de nuestra historia dejando en claro que “sin libertad no hay cultura y sin cultura no hay identidad”.
De esta manera, Aguascalientes se convierte en el único estado del país en donde la tauromaquia está blindada y la Feria Nacional de San Marcos es parte del patrimonio cultural que podremos heredar a las próximas generaciones.

"'They're not government waste': Sen. Schumer defends VA workers, opposes Doge cuts - WHEC.com","‘They’re not government waste’: Sen. Schumer defends VA workers, opposes Doge cuts
CANANDAIGUA, N.Y. – Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer visited Canandaigua to oppose cuts to the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).
“We’re here because we love our veterans. We love them. We respect them. We admire them and now, a meat ax is being taken to the VA,” Schumer said. He emphasized that 80,000 VA jobs could be cut nationwide by August, affecting nearly one-fifth of the workforce.
Schumer criticized the cuts, saying, “Let me tell DOGE and Musk they [VA employees] are not government waste. Workers here are not government waste, they’re not government inefficiency, they’re the government’s best.”
Wayne Thompson, a U.S. Marine Corps veteran, expressed his pride in the VA hospital where he worked as a nurse for 28 years. “The proposed staffing cuts would be detrimental, not only to veterans in need of assistance but also to the remaining employees who provide these vital services… It needs to stop before it’s too late!”
VA Press Secretary Pete Kasperowicz released a statement saying”
“Imagine how much better off Veterans would be if lawmakers like Sen. Schumer cared as much about fixing VA as they do about protecting the department’s broken bureaucracy. Here are the facts:
VA health care has been on the Government Accountability Office’s high-risk list for more than a decade, and GAO says VA faces “system-wide challenges in overseeing patient safety and access to care, hiring critical staff, and meeting future infrastructure needs.” Under Secretary Collins, VA is working hard to fix these and other issues. Unfortunately, many in the media, government union bosses and some in Congress are fighting to keep in place the broken status quo. Our message to Veterans is simple: Despite major opposition from those who don’t want to change a thing at VA, we will reform the department to make it work better for Veterans, families, caregivers and survivors.”
According to the DOGE, the cuts have saved $155 billion. The VA ranks 19th on DOGE’s efficiency board.
Ronnie Orlowski, Canandaigua VA employee and President of AFGE Local 3306 that represents Canandaigua VA workers voiced concerns about the cuts, saying, “They’re killing the people that work here. They’re going to be killing veterans because they’re not going to get the care they need. These veterans were promised care. They should have world-class care. The VA provides world-class care, continue to provide it.”
Schumer described the cuts as a “grave threat” and a “direct assault on New York vets.
This is not the first wave of cuts impacting the VA. Rochester workers have also been fired.

Em coletiva realizada na manhã da última sexta-feira (11), o prefeito Renan Pontelli anunciou o lançamento de nove obras de grande porte. No total, a Prefeitura de Tupã vai investir R$54 milhões nos projetos, que incluem a construção de três unidades de ensino, um centro de atendimento pediátrico e um pronto socorro na zona leste.
A Escola Profissionalizante e a Praça dos 500 Anos também passarão por remodelação completa. O pacote é fechado com a construção da nova sede da Secretaria de Saúde, que vai integrar o Centro de Saúde I, formando um grande complexo.

“Este investimento foi feito pensando também no futuro. Estamos planejando a cidade para que haja tranquilidade e desenvolvimento. E para que isso aconteça, é necessário haver educação, saúde e espaço para o crescimento das atividades econômicas. Com estas obras, estamos incentivando o crescimento destes setores”, justificou o prefeito.
De acordo com Pontelli, boa parte dos recursos necessários para realização das obras vai ser custeada pelo próprio município e o restante virá dos governos estadual e federal, por meio de emendas parlamentares.

“Todo este investimento vai garantir o desenvolvimento urbano, a valorização dos espaços públicos e a melhoria da qualidade de vida da população, além de ter reflexo imediato na qualidade de serviços essenciais como saúde e educação”, acrescentou o chefe do Executivo.
Obras
O pacote anunciado nesta sexta prevê a revitalização da Praça dos 500 Anos. A área pública, que até o início deste ano estava comprometida e tomada por uma grande erosão vai apresentar novos espaços integrados e ligados por uma pista de caminhada, além de quadras esportivas, circuito funcional infantil, cidade da criança, pomar de frutas, academia ao ar livre e uma fonte interativa. A ideia é transformar a nova praça em um local que atraia todas as gerações.
Outra obra anunciada, que vai resgatar um dos espaços mais tradicionais da cidade, é a revitalização do ‘Mercadão Municipal’. Localizado em área nobre, no centro da cidade, o prédio está hoje situação de abandono. O projeto vai resgatar completamente o espaço, mas manter sua estrutura clássica.

Após a revitalização, edifício vai se tornar um polo comercialização de alimentos frescos e de alta qualidade, além de produtos regionais, gastronomia típica, artesanato, feira do produtor, praça de alimentação e centro cultural. O ‘Mercadão’ vai ser um espaço para impulsionar a economia local com a valorização dos pequenos produtores e deve fortalecer o turismo.
A educação também vai ser impulsionada significativamente com as obras anunciadas nesta sexta. O pacote prevê a reforma completa da Escola Profissionalizante, outro prédio que está marcado na história da cidade.
A ideia é remodelar o espaço para aumentar a integração com a comunidade e adequá-lo aos novos tempos, oferecendo educação profissional também para os novos mercados, com enfoque especial na área de tecnologia, a que mais cresce e absorve mão de obra em todo o mundo.
Se o projeto prevê também especialização para jovens e adultos, é na formação das crianças que reside um de seus pontos mais altos: no total, serão construídas e equipadas três novas escolas, que complementarão a rede municipal, garantindo que, mesmo com um crescimento no número de alunos, o trabalho prestado pela Secretaria de Educação siga o alto padrão que tem sido uma de suas principais marcas.

Os novos prédios serão construídos nas regiões de maior concentração populacional seguindo estudos realizados pela Pasta. Uma destas escolas será erguida próximo à Emeief Governador Mário Covas, no Parque Residencial Casari. Esta nova unidade foi planejada para atender a crescente demanda da região. O prédio terá salas modernas e amplas, estrutura acessível e ambientes acolhedores para facilitar o aprendizado.
A segunda unidade vai ser construída na rua Ernesto Coquemala, e vai desafogar a atual estrutura da Emeief Professor Thiago Alves da Silva Leandro. A ideia é oferecer espaço amplo e funcional, que garanta a qualidade do ensino aos estudantes e integração com a comunidade.
Fechando a parte dedicada à educação, a Prefeitura anunciou também uma nova creche-escola, que será um espaço à primeira infância, localizado na esquina das ruas Prudente e Nápoles, que vai acolher as crianças em um espaço amplo e adequado, garantindo tranquilidade aos pais e ajudando a construir a base educacional.

A saúde, outro ponto sensível, também vai receber investimentos de peso, segundo o anúncio desta sexta-feira. Um projeto que vinha sendo aguardado pela população é a construção da Unidade de Pronto Atendimento Municipal na Zona Leste da cidade, região que concentra mais da metade da população tupãense.
Este novo pronto-socorro vai beneficiar diretamente os moradores daquela parte da cidade e desafogar o atendimento na UPA e na Santa Casa, tornando mais eficiente o sistema de saúde no município.
Outro ponto de destaque é a construção do novo Posto de Saúde na avenida Tapuias, que vai abrigar também a sede da Secretaria de Saúde. Esta unidade será equipada e estruturada para oferecer atendimento próximo e de qualidade à população, reduzindo deslocamentos e fortalecendo o cuidado contínuo com a saúde dos tupãenses.

A Prefeitura anunciou ainda a criação de um Centro Médico especializado em Pediatria, que vai ser implementado em espaço de tempo mais curto e funcionará em um imóvel alugado, que será readequado e receberá equipamento e especialistas para prestar atendimento exclusivo às crianças.
O chefe do Executivo tupãense destacou que o anúncio desta manhã vai nortear a linha de trabalho e, quando estiver concluído, vai permitir um salto considerável e abrangente na qualidade de vida da população.
“Com este investimento, a Prefeitura quer garantir que a cidade em que vivemos seja cada vez melhor. Estamos trabalhando pelo presente, mas pensando também no futuro”, concluiu o prefeito Renan Pontelli.

放宽店铺外摆凸显城市治理温度|浙江省_新浪财经_新浪网,"编辑部：
记者最近在地方采访时发现，一些城市临街商铺开展外摆经营的情况明显增多。日前，以杭州为代表的浙江多个城市放宽店铺外摆政策，因地制宜支持商贸经营主体利用自有场地外摆促销，支持临街商铺开展外摆经营，并协调解决外摆集中区停车难问题。这些举措凸显城市治理的温度与精度，让“烟火气”升腾、市集更热闹，进一步激活了消费市场。
记者注意到，浙江放宽外摆，并非“地摊经济”的低层次回归，而是对新经济形态融入城市肌理的一种探索实践。以杭州传统街区吴山广场为例，“外摆新政”实施后，吴山广场附近街区实现迭代升级，许多充满数字科技、市井烟火气、沉浸式文旅及原创品牌的新潮店铺落地。走在石板路上，人们吃着带有麦香与炭火气息的路边摊，欣赏AR技术投影出的宋韵水墨画。“烟火气”与“潮生活”交织，市民和外地游客纷纷前来“打卡”。对于商业外摆，浙江提供精准政策支持，激发商家们“摆”出新意、“摆”对内容，形成独特的消费场景，为放大线下消费开辟了新路径。
当然，放宽店铺外摆，不应是刺激消费的“急就章”，不能简单停留在放开或放宽的层次上，还要有长远谋划。比如，可针对城市文化禀赋和特色景观，充分利用外摆区空间搭建星空棚、露营区等，打造以地方美食、民生夜市等为主题的品牌集市，充分营造体验式消费氛围，不断推动各类商圈提颜值、聚人气、添活力。
放宽店铺外摆，具有重要的经济价值。城市公共空间不仅具有物理属性，更是经济活动的重要载体。对于商铺经营者来说，放宽外摆后，可联动室内室外经营空间，通过延长消费者停留时间、增强场景体验感等，创造出“空间溢价”。从资源配置角度看，通过“潮汐型”“便民型”摊位设置，可实现公共空间的时间维度再分配，盘活闲置空间资源，实现效益最大化。
放宽店铺外摆，考验治理智慧。此前，一些地方的监管过于严苛，对摆摊设点“光踩刹车”“只设路障”；一些地方又过于宽松、听之任之，最终影响城市形象。如何跳出“一管就死，一放就乱”的怪圈？治理理念的转变是关键。只有打破传统“以罚代管”模式，将治理重心从“禁止外摆”转向“规范引导”，将外摆审批权限下放，使审批效率和商户合规经营率同步提升，实现从“堵”到“疏”的转变。当前，不少城市管理部门积极推进“首违不罚”，实施包容审慎监管，构建法治营商暖环境。在柔性执法中包容审慎，在包容审慎中柔性执法，才能更好实现城市市容和市场繁荣相兼容。

信用合规双引擎激活高质量发展新动能|市场监管局_新浪财经_新浪网,"本报南昌讯（郑昕 记者朱海）4月16日，记者从江西省鹰潭市市场监管局获悉，该局联合鹰潭市发改委正式印发《鹰潭市经营主体信用合规建设的指导意见（第二版）》，通过清单化服务精准施策，引导全市经营主体提升信用合规水平，为经济高质量发展注入新动能。
　　以《全国失信惩戒措施基础清单（2024年版）》为蓝本，鹰潭市市场监管局创新构建“信用合规指导清单”与“失信联合惩戒清单”双引擎，推动经营主体诚信自律、稳健发展。其中，“信用合规指导清单”覆盖反垄断、反不正当竞争、知识产权等15大类86项合规事项，“失信联合惩戒清单”细化11类惩戒措施及80条惩戒内容，明确可为与不可为，为经营主体划清合规边界，形成“一处失信、全域受限”的信用闭环。
　　聚焦特色铜产业，鹰潭市市场监管局以信用合规建设为抓手，推动行业标杆引领与全域升级。以铜产业领跑，重点在贵溪市、余江区、高新区针对规模以上铜企业推进构建270户信用合规建设单位，围绕生产标准、质量管控、知识产权等环节，定制“一企一策”指导方案，强化产业链韧性；以服务业破冰，在月湖区、龙虎山景区、信江新区针对餐饮、食品及服务企业推进构建30户信用合规建设单位，通过“合规示范+案例推广”模式，打造可复制经验，形成“合规即受益”的正向循环。
　　以信用赋能、分类施策为核心，鹰潭市市场监管局构建全链条治理生态。推进部门联动，深化与法院、发改、税务等部门的数据共享，动态监控企业经营风险，实现“事前合规引导、事中智能预警、事后联合惩戒”；探索场景应用，推动信用评价结果在行政审批、融资贷款、招标投标等场景落地，降低企业交易成本。同时，树立标杆示范，力争3年内打造全省信用监管样板城市，撬动市场活力与社会效益的双重跃升，为高质量发展注入信用动能。",2025-04-17T01:07:00.000+03:00,https://finance.sina.com.cn/jjxw/2025-04-17/doc-inetmkhi3878073.shtml,sina.com.cn,positive

Ukrainian drone manufacturers received over $ 2 bn from the Ministry of Defence in 2024-2025 - Euromaidan Press,"Drone production is crucial for Ukraine as it enables the country to counter Russia’s larger military resources, strike deep behind enemy lines, and reduce reliance on traditional munitions and foreign arms . Since 2022, Ukraine has massively expanded its domestic drone industry, increasing output from around 20,000 drones per month in early 2024 to over 200,000 per month by early 2025. The total annual production surpassed 2 million. Ukraine reportedly plans to reach up to 4.5 million drones in 2025.
Ukraine’s Defence Procurement Agency works with 36 producers of FPV drones. These maneuverable small devices deliver precise strikes on targets and are actively used on the front line.
The ministry also cooperates with 14 manufacturers of bomber drones capable of dropping ammunition on enemy targets with high precision from the air.
Twelve companies produce reconnaissance aircraft and wing-type drones that provide deep aerial reconnaissance and fire adjustment for Ukrainian forces.
According to the ministry, the agency contracted five producers of deepstrike drones designed for long-range strikes exceeding 400 km against enemy rear facilities.
Five manufacturers supply reusable aircraft-type strike drones that can carry explosive payloads and return to base after completing missions.
The Defence Procurement Agency also works with three producers of short-range kamikaze aircraft for striking targets at tactical depths, and one manufacturer of aerial targets that simulate enemy drones or aircraft for training and testing air defense systems.
The ministry also reported that Ukraine recently launched a new government grant program for developers of military equipment and components for armaments.

GWM desembarca 900 veículos em porto de Vitória; mantém plano de abertura de fábrica em SP,"GWM desembarca 900 veículos em porto de Vitória; mantém plano de abertura de fábrica em SP
Um navio cargueiro com 900 veículos da GWM chegou ao porto de Vitória nesta semana depois de ter saído de Xangai em meados de março, confirmou a montadora chinesa nesta quarta-feira.
Imagens da Reuters mostram o pátio do porto com filas de veículos utilitários esportivos. Segundo a montadora, os modelos são da linha Haval H6, uma das mais vendidas da marca no país. O navio também trouxe o utilitário offroad híbrido Tank 300, lançado no início do mês no Brasil, disse a GWM.
A montadora esclareceu que o cargueiro de bandeira norueguesa que saiu de Xangai em 18 de março é do tipo Ro-Ro, comumente usado no transporte de veículos e equipamentos como maquinário agrícola e de mineração, e que o navio não é de uso exclusivo da GWM, sendo compartilhado por outras empresas.
A GWM registrou vendas de 5.767 unidades do Haval H6 no Brasil no primeiro trimestre, na frente de modelos mais tradicionais do segmento, como o Renault Duster, segundo dados da associação de concessionários Fenabrave.
A montadora mantém planos de abertura de sua fábrica em Iracemápolis, no interior de São Paulo, em meados deste ano, segundo o diretor de assuntos institucionais da GWM Brasil, Ricardo Bastos. A unidade, comprada da Mercedes-Benz em 2021, está ""na reta final de preparação"", afirmou.
Quando a fábrica ficar pronta, a GWM vai produzir o Haval H6 e, numa segunda etapa, uma picape, de acordo com o executivo.
As turbulências tarifárias criadas pela guerra comercial iniciada pelo presidente dos EUA, Donald Trump, não alterou o projeto, disse Bastos, em resposta a perguntas da Reuters.
""O governo brasileiro está lidando muito bem com essa situação. Entendemos que a direção adotada pelo vice-presidente Geraldo Alckmin (também ministro do Desenvolvimento, Indústria e Comércio) mostra que o Brasil está respeitando as regras já definidas"", disse o executivo, se referindo ao aumento gradual do imposto de importação pelo governo federal no segmento de híbridos e elétricos a partir do início do ano passado.
A indústria automotiva nacional tem cobrado do governo federal a antecipação do aumento do imposto a 35%, o que atualmente está previsto para ocorrer apenas em meados do ano que vem.",2025-04-17T01:05:00.000+03:00,"https://www.terra.com.br/economia/gwm-desembarca-900-veiculos-em-porto-de-vitoria-mantem-plano-de-abertura-de-fabrica-em-sp,7a845657a2a48305cd2678ee393f8fd301iclr7u.html",reuters,positive

共筑国家安全防线 谱写全民教育新篇|贵阳市_新浪财经_新浪网,"转自：贵州日报
通讯员 杨雪梅
安而不忘危，存而不忘亡，治而不忘乱。
4月15日是第十个全民国家安全教育日，贵阳贵安围绕“全民国家安全教育 走深走实十周年”这一主题，积极谋划、迅速行动，以一系列形式多样、内容丰富的宣传教育活动为载体，让国家安全意识深入人心，推动国家安全教育不断向纵深发展。
打造宣传阵地，让国安教育“触手可及”
为让国家安全宣传教育更贴近民众，贵阳贵安在宣传阵地建设上不断创新。近日，云岩区黔灵山公园三岭湾隧道旁新建的国家安全教育主题广场正式亮相，吸引了不少市民驻足参观。
主题广场依托黔灵山公园得天独厚的地理优势和高人气，精心设置了主题景观、固定宣传栏等设施，以生动的图文展示、有趣的互动问答和典型的案例分析，将国家安全知识融入日常休闲场景中，让市民在休闲中潜移默化地接受国家安全知识教育。
“主题广场特别好，以前觉得国家安全离我们很远，现在看到这些内容，才发现国家安全与我们每个人息息相关，我们在生活中要时刻保持警惕。”市民王先生的一番感慨，道出了许多人的心声。
此前，贵阳贵安多地已先行一步，相继推出贵州国家安全教育基地、南明区国家安全教育主题广场、观山湖区国家安全教育示范街及总体国家安全观主题展厅、乌当区总体国家安全观主题公园、息烽县国家安全主题公园、开阳县总体国家安全观主题公园等一批主题宣教阵地，进一步普及宣传国家安全知识，增强全民国家安全意识和素养。
面向未来，贵阳贵安将在加强国家安全宣传教育上持续发力，用好主题公园、主题广场、示范街等载体阵地，营造良好的浓厚社会氛围，让守护国家安全成为每一位市民的自觉行动。
创新宣传形式，让国安知识“入脑入心”
在全民国家安全教育日来临之际，贵阳贵安还充分利用现代科技，结合丰富的文化活动，开展国家安全主题歌曲、动漫视频等创作，全方位、多元化宣传。
4月11日晚，贵阳路边音乐会在夜色中奏响。舞台上，歌手们用动人的歌声传递着守护国家安全的信念；舞台下，市民们沉浸在音乐的海洋中，也悄然将国家安全知识“收入囊中”。
“一边听音乐，一边学知识。不知不觉中，国家安全知识便记住了，这种寓教于乐的方式真是太棒了。”市民李女士赞不绝口。
与此同时，一场大型摄影作品展在贵阳举行，用镜头将总体国家安全观具象化，让观众在欣赏艺术之美的同时，深刻理解国家安全的内涵。
不仅如此，贵阳贵安还开展了一系列精彩纷呈的宣传活动。主题灯光秀点亮夜空的同时，也点亮市民心间的国安意识；贵州长征文化数字艺术馆（红飘带）内，国家安全知识竞答活动火热开展，一问一答间，参观者对维护国家安全有了更深刻的认识……
无论是街头巷尾的音乐旋律，还是展厅中的光影定格，抑或是舞台上的生动演绎，都化作了一条条纽带，把抽象的国安理念具象化，融入市民生活的方方面面，让群众自然而然地成为国家安全知识的“吸收者”与“传播者”，真正实现国安知识“入脑入心”。
聚焦重点群体，让国安意识“生根发芽”
在贵阳贵安这片土地上，一场全民国家安全教育的热潮席卷而来，从校园到企业，从城市到乡村，重点群体全覆盖，让国安意识处处“生根发芽”。
在全民国家安全教育日前后，贵阳贵安通过“请进来+走出去”的方式，持续开展国家安全进校园系列活动，引导青少年树立牢固的国家安全意识，增强自我保护能力。
近日，南明区人武部联合区教育局邀请辖区全国国防教育示范学校和“八一”爱民小学30余名学生走进军营。学生们近距离观摩军事装备、了解革命先烈的英勇事迹和军人保卫国家的责任和使命，增强学生们对国家安全的责任感、使命感。
国家安全进高校系列活动也开展得如火如荼。一场场集中宣讲、读书会、文艺演出等宣传活动，深入浅出地剖析当下复杂多变的国际形势、国内安全隐患以及大学生肩负的独特责任，以专业知识驱散懵懂、启迪心智。
企业作为社会发展的主力军，积极组织党员干部到贵阳贵安各大主题场所，深入开展国家安全教育实践活动，通过沉浸式教育引导党员干部树牢总体国家安全观，把维护国家安全的政治责任落实到企业改革发展的每个环节，融入日常生产运营的方方面面。
在城市基层，社区工作人员借助宣传栏、横幅、宣传手册等，把国家安全知识送到居民家门口，面对面答疑解惑。在民俗赶集日，镇村干部用质朴的民族语言，在集市普及国安知识，使其深入人心。
从校园的青春朝气，到企业的实干担当，再到城乡的烟火日常，贵阳贵安全民国家安全教育日宣传活动全面铺开，如燎原之火燃遍各个角落，汇聚全民之力谱写国安新篇，共护家国安宁。",2025-04-17T01:13:00.000+03:00,https://finance.sina.com.cn/jjxw/2025-04-17/doc-inetmkhi3878935.shtml,sina.com.cn,positive
"辽宁自贸试验区深耕八年见""丰景""|辽宁省_新浪财经_新浪网","转自：辽宁日报
本报讯 记者董翰博报道 一片改革开放“试验田”经过精心耕作、悉心管护，正在收获累累果实，培育“良种”的经验也在向更大范围推广。辽宁自贸试验区建设运营8年来，实际利用外资累计50亿美元，外贸进出口额突破1万亿元。2024年，28项创新经验在全省复制推广，其中1项创新经验在全国复制推广；外贸进出口额达1543.7亿元，同比增长22%，其中通过制度创新推动外贸新增量达230亿元。
建设自由贸易试验区是党中央在新时代推进改革开放的重要战略举措。2017年4月辽宁自贸试验区揭牌成立至今，建设运营已有8年。这一平台在制度创新方面探索了哪些新途径、积累了哪些新经验？经营主体有何获得感？4月16日，省商务厅及辽宁自贸试验区沈阳片区、大连片区、营口片区的相关负责人在省政府新闻办召开的新闻发布会上对社会普遍关注的问题作介绍、解答。
省商务厅相关负责人表示，8年来，全省上下全面落实党中央、国务院关于自贸试验区建设的战略部署，推动自贸试验区提质增效，以制度创新为核心，立足创新推动制度型开放、创新带动外贸高质量增长、创新推动全产业链发展、创新推动区域联动发展四方面重点，各项工作取得积极成果。
自贸试验区是深层次改革的排头兵、高水平开放的引领者。8年来，我省坚持创新推动制度型开放。在参与国内、国际标准制定方面，2024年辽宁自贸试验区积极对接国际高标准，共计推出4项改革创新经验在全省复制推广。
贸易便利化是自贸试验区的发力重点。我省进行一系列探索，创新带动外贸高质量增长。比如，我省推出中欧班列综保区前站式集拼、中欧班列“多点集发”海关监管等系列创新模式。2024年，中欧班列进出口货值16.8亿元，同比增长13%。开展跨境电商零售进口“便捷监管”、跨境出口商品清单布控自动分拣等模式。2024年，辽宁自贸试验区跨境电商进出口额达68.1亿元，同比增长39.8%。
推动产业高质量发展是自贸试验区制度创新的重要目标。多年来，辽宁自贸试验区一直在围绕重点产业培育加强部署，创新推动全产业链发展。经过8年的开拓创新，辽宁自贸试验区初步构建了以汽车及零部件、航空装备、生物可降解材料等主导产业为支撑的产业体系。2024年，辽宁自贸试验区工业产值达1315亿元。沈阳片区形成了央地合作打造航空产业集群等多项创新成果，聚集了沈飞民机、南航沈阳维修基地等30余家航空制造与维修的骨干企业。大连片区形成了进出口车辆运输降本增效工作新举措等多项创新成果，聚集了东风日产、奇瑞汽车两大整车厂以及一批汽车零部件配套企业。营口片区形成了科技创新型企业“靶向培育”新机制等多项创新成果，聚集了东盛集团等规模以上新材料企业30家。
自贸试验区联动发展是统筹深层次改革和高水平开放的内在要求。“2024年以来，我省持续强化自贸试验区与重点产业园区联动创新发展，成果不断涌现。”省商务厅相关负责人举例，沈阳片区与大连片区联合试点进口食品《入境货物检验检疫证明》（以下简称《证明》）电子化互认，解决了企业往返海关开具纸质《证明》等问题，截至2024年年底，共签发《证明》2.8万份、食品《证明》近2万份，为企业节省了大量运营成本。
省商务厅相关负责人表示，今年辽宁自贸试验区将深入实施自贸试验区提升战略，更好发挥辽宁自贸试验区示范引领作用。谋划制定辽宁自贸试验区提升战略实施方案或重点任务清单，积极推进大连片区整合提升；开展首创性、集成式探索，持续推动沈阳片区开展飞机保税维修业务，促进国际艺术品产业创新发展，深化大连片区大宗商品贸易制度创新，建立出口汽车“出厂即入港、入港即退税、报备即出口”物流新模式，支持营口片区陆港枢纽产业园、绿色包装产业园建设。",2025-04-17T01:09:00.000+03:00,https://finance.sina.com.cn/jjxw/2025-04-17/doc-inetmkha6205036.shtml,sina.com.cn,positive

黔西南为住房公积金松绑|住房公积金_新浪财经_新浪网,"转自：贵州日报
本报讯（记者 余坤）4月9日，记者从黔西南州住房公积金支持多样化住房消费需求新闻发布会上获悉，为充分发挥住房公积金服务大局和住房保障作用，黔西南州出台《关于住房公积金支持多样化住房消费需求的实施意见》。
支持住房公积金购房代际互助。缴存人家庭购房时，可以同时提取本人和配偶及其父母、子女住房公积金个人账户余额用于支付购房首付款。缴存人购买黔西南州商品住房的，可同时提取本人和配偶及其父母、子女住房公积金个人账户余额用于支付购房首付款，提取总额加贷款金额不超过购房价款总额。
拓宽住房消费提取住房公积金范围。缴存人住房公积金贷款已结清的，支持提取住房公积金个人账户余额用于购买新建商品自住房装修、支付自住房物业管理费。
提高贷款最高限额。单缴存职工家庭贷款最高限额提高到60万元、双缴存或多子女职工家庭贷款最高额度提高到70万元、高层次人才贷款最高额度提高到100万元。异地缴存职工、本州缴存职工享受同等权益。降低购买保障房首付比例，申请使用住房公积金贷款购买保障性住房的，最低首付比例为15%。
支持申请办理住房公积金“合力贷”业务，新申请及已发放的住房公积金贷款，借款人及其共同借款人的父母、子女可自愿申请作为贷款保证人。保证人住房公积金贷款已结清的，可申请使用保证人住房公积金账户资金按月偿还或提前结清“合力贷”。",2025-04-17T01:09:00.000+03:00,https://finance.sina.com.cn/jjxw/2025-04-17/doc-inetmkhe2716385.shtml,sina.com.cn,positive
Accord historique à l'OMS sur la préparation et la lutte contre les futures pandémies - l'Opinion,"Accord historique à l’OMS sur la préparation et la lutte contre les futures pandémies
« Vous avez écrit l’histoire », a déclaré le directeur général de
l’OMS, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, aux délégués vers 04h00 (02h00 GMT). Pour l’OMS, ses Etats membres « ont fait un grand pas en avant dans les efforts visant à rendre le monde plus sûr face aux pandémies ». Le projet d’accord doit encore être formellement approuvé lors de la prochaine Assemblée mondiale de la Santé en mai. Le texte a a été validé vers 02h00 (00h00 GMT) après une ultime négociation marathon de plus de 15 heures.
Multilatéralisme. Les pays ont « démontré que le multilatéralisme est bien vivant », a relevé M. Tedros, alors que les négociations se sont déroulées dans un contexte de crise du système de santé mondial, provoquée par les coupes drastiques dans l’aide internationale américaine décidées par le président
Donald Trump, et de menaces de droits de douane américains sur la pharmacie. « Cet accord peut être qualifié d’historique, sans exagération », a affirmé le ministre allemand de la Santé Karl Lauterbach, assurant toutefois que « tout cela a été considérablement affaibli par le retrait prévu des Etats-Unis de (...) l’OMS dans son ensemble ».
Cinq ans après l’arrivée du
Covid-19, ses millions de morts et une économie mondiale dévastée, l’accord doit permettre de mieux préparer le monde, loin d'être équipé pour affronter une autre pandémie, selon l’OMS et les experts. « La conclusion des négociations (...) représente une étape importante dans notre engagement collectif à renforcer la sécurité sanitaire mondiale (...) bien que le processus n’ait peut-être pas donné tous les résultats escomptés », a déclaré le représentant tanzanien, au nom de dizaines de pays africains, devant les délégués.
Sur X, la présidente de la Commission européenne
Ursula von der Leyen a également salué le consensus : « Nous avons tiré les leçons du Covid. Pour vaincre une pandémie, il faut des tests, des traitements et des vaccins. Mais il faut aussi de la solidarité et de la coopération mondiale ». Cet accord propose « des avancées majeures pour le secteur de l’industrie en santé, s’agissant notamment du développement de la R&D, le renforcement de la coopération scientifique sur les pathogènes émergents et le soutien à la production locale de contremesures médicales », a observé Christophe Lemoine, porte-parole du ministère français des Affaires étrangères.
Griefs. Les négociations avaient avancé plus lentement que prévu mardi, après trois jours de pause, butant essentiellement jusqu’au bout sur le transfert de technologies pour la production de produits de santé liés aux pandémies, en particulier au profit des pays en développement. Le sujet avait été au cœur des nombreux griefs des pays les plus démunis lors de la pandémie de Covid-19, quand ils voyaient les pays riches s’accaparer les doses de vaccin et autres tests.
Plusieurs pays, où l’industrie pharmaceutique pèse lourd dans l'économie, sont opposés à l’idée d’obligation de transfert et insistent sur son caractère volontaire. Un consensus a finalement émergé autour du principe de transfert de technologies « convenu d’un commun accord ». Le prévoit par ailleurs la création d’un « Système d’accès aux agents pathogènes et de partage des avantages » (PABS en anglais), à savoir les produits de santé découlant de leur utilisation, comme des vaccins ou des tests par exemple. Il vise aussi à élargir l’accès à ces produits en établissant un réseau mondial de chaîne d’approvisionnement et de logistique.
« Le vrai travail commence maintenant », a averti le représentant de l’Eswatini. Un avis que partagent des ONG. Pour Michelle Childs, directrice à l’Initiative Médicaments contre les maladies négligées (DNDi), qui a suivi de près les négociations, « les pays ne doivent pas attendre l’adoption formelle de l’accord en mai pour agir ». En ce qui concerne la mise en œuvre de l’accord, la principale organisation du secteur pharmaceutique a mis l’accent sur la propriété intellectuelle et la sécurité juridique, les jugeant « essentielles » pour que l’industrie investisse dans une recherche très risquée financièrement lors de la prochaine crise.

A turma do Xandão DEFINIU! Idosos +60 não precisam devolver valores ao INSS,"A turma do Supremo Tribunal Federal (STF) decidiu e os idosos 60+ não precisam devolver os valores ao INSS. A decisão vem após análise de um processo aberto por um sindicado, mas deve ser válida para todos os casos. Entenda melhor o que foi decidido e como você pode ser afetado.
A turma do Xandão DEFINIU! Idosos +60 não precisam devolver valores ao INSS
(Imagem: Jeane de Oliveira/ FDR) Após julgar um processo aberto pela Confederação dos Metalúrgicos, o STF decidiu que o idosos 60+ não precisam devolver os valores ao INSS. Sendo assim, não é necessário você não precisa se preocupar com o dinheiro que foi recebido legalmente. Por outro lado, é importante entender o que foi decidido pelos ministros, o FDR explica agora.
Idosos 60+ não precisam devolver os valores ao INSS No julgamento os ministros do Supremo Tribunal Federal decidiram que os idosos 60+ não precisam devolver o dinheiro da revisão da vida toda. A corte julgava um processo aberto pela Confederação Nacional dos Trabalhadores Metalúrgicos (CNTM), uma das entidades que desejavam garantir a revisão.
A decisão é importante porque no ano passado o Supremo rejeitou a Revisão da Vida Toda. Contudo, ainda estava pendente a partir de quando a medida seria aplicada e se ela era válida também para os aposentados que já haviam ganhado esse tipo de ações na Justiça.
Agora fica definido que os idosos não precisarão devolver os valores recebidos após ganharem ações de revisão de seus benefícios. Durante o julgamento o ministro Dias Toffoli defendeu a modulação da decisão, assim quem teve a ação julgada por instâncias menores não precisara devolver o valor recebido também.
“Ao não modularmos, houve uma quebra de confiança naquilo que os segurados depositaram, em razão de precedentes do STJ e do próprio STF” , comentou o ministro, segundo a Agência Brasil.
Inclusive, o ministro Nunes Marques, relator do processo, reajustou o voto e seguiu o entendimento de Dias Toffoli.
“Não se trata de incoerência da Corte, mas não podemos quebrar a confiança daquele que procura o Poder Judiciário com base nos seus precedentes”, disse Toffoli.
Os ministros também definiram que os valores recebidos em decisões definitivas ou provisórias tomadas até 5 de abril de 2024, quando a tese da revisão foi derrubada, não precisarão ser devolvidos.
Revisão da vida toda A revisão da vida toda é uma espécie de recálculo em que o INSS incluiria todas as contribuições previdenciárias feitas pelo segurado ao longo da vida. Nesse cálculo seriam consideradas até as contribuições anteriores à julho de 1994, quando o Plano Real foi implementado. Assim, ele pode passar a receber benefícios com valores mais altos.
Em 2022 o Supremo formou maioria para permitir que o próprio segurado escolhesse qual o tipo de cálculo seria usado no valor da aposentadoria, considerando o mais benéfico. No entanto, em 2024 a Corte voltou atrás e afastou esse entendimento durante o julgamento de duas ações.
Sendo assim, ficou definido que a regra de transição do fator previdenciário seria adotada. Portanto, as contribuições anteriores a 1994 seriam excluídas, ou seja, o segurado não pode mais escolher qual a forma de cálculo do seu benefício.
Em setembro do ano passado novamente o Supremo reconheceu essa decisão e manteve o fator previdenciário.
Atenção, Yasmin Souza , especialista do FDR, informa que o INSS está excluindo o benefício de quem não cumpre com uma importante regra, descubra qual.

Climate Action Now: Why Tackling Methane Is Key to Slowing Global Warming,"<p>Methane is not just another <a href=""https://www.deccanherald.com/tags/greenhouse-gases"">greenhouse gas</a>, it is surprisingly full of hope and one of the most potent yet immediate levers we have to cool the planet.</p>.<p>We mostly hear about carbon dioxide (CO2) in the climate debates while methane is often sidelined. It is 80 times more potent than CO2 at warming the planet over a 20-year period, which means even a small release of methane is loaded with more global warming potential. But here’s the twist: methane is short-lived. Unlike CO2, which resides in the atmosphere for hundreds of years, methane only stays for about 12 years. That’s some good news. Researchers think that methane might hold the fastest key to slowing global warming. Therefore, if we focus on methane now, we may be able to see the difference in its atmospheric concentration and climate much sooner.</p>.<p>Agriculture, being the primary human-caused source, contributes about 40% of global emissions, and in many developing countries, where farming is central to livelihoods, it becomes a complex issue. A vital emission source is flooded rice fields, which create an anaerobic environment, making it a cosy home for the methane-emitting microbes. Through enteric fermentation, cows also release methane. In this natural process, microbes in their stomach break down the food and produce methane as a by-product. Then, there is stored manure which acts as a methane generator.</p>.<p>However, methane’s impact does not just stop at warming the planet. It is also responsible for the formation of ground-level ozone, a pollutant that affects the respiratory system, as well as the ecosystem and vegetation, which makes it a public health and food security issue as well. A crucial point to note here is that methane’s impact has become much broader, and its story deserves immediate attention.</p>.<p>So, how do we measure methane emissions? Even today, our methods are limited. Life Cycle Assessment or LCA is useful when evaluating the emissions from a product across its life cycle. There are bottom-up methods that count emissions from farms, landfills, etc., using emission factors, such as N cows = X kg methane per year, to estimate the total. Then, there are top-down methods using satellites to observe and scan methane in the atmosphere. Often, these two methods do not agree, and satellites sometimes show more methane than the reports from bottom-up methods might suggest.</p>.IIT Guwahati develops tech to convert methane, carbon dioxide into eco-friendly biofuel.<p><strong>Climate-smart agriculture</strong></p>.<p>However, the bright side is that solutions exist, and many of them are implementable. For example, intermittent irrigation and alternate wetting and drying methods in rice fields might help cut methane emissions and save us a lot of water, which can be a win-win. Cows can be fed more easily digestible high-quality forages and seaweed-based additives along with the addition of fats and oils in their diets, which could reduce emissions. Biogas digesters can be used to turn manure into clean energy.</p>.<p>All these methods fall under the broader umbrella of climate-smart agriculture, which aims to increase food productivity while mitigating climate change, thereby integrating farming into the climate solution. This is not just theoretical – India is already forging ahead through initiatives like the National Biogas Mission, which seeks to expand renewable energy from agricultural waste. Also, while India is not yet a signatory to the Global Methane Pledge (where over 150 countries have signed to cut down methane by 30% by 2030), its domestic strategic efforts are moving in a constructive direction.</p>.<p>Yet, the path forward is not without obstacles. Much of the methane data and mitigation models come from advanced industrial economies. For regions like South Asia, we need more geographically targeted research and farmer-centric policy frameworks that centre agriculture, not overlook it. Efforts to bridge the gaps between satellite data and what is happening on the ground are also crucial.</p>.<p>So often, we talk about climate change in terms of doom and distance. However, methane is a here-and-now problem. It is one of the few areas in climate action where the science is clear, technology exists, and the window for observable outcomes is brief. Tackling methane won’t solve everything going on with climate change. However, it buys us time, thereby giving us a chance to slow down the warming.

<p>Methane is not just another <a href=""https://www.deccanherald.com/tags/greenhouse-gases"">greenhouse gas</a>, it is surprisingly full of hope and one of the most potent yet immediate levers we have to cool the planet.</p>.<p>We mostly hear about carbon dioxide (CO2) in the climate debates while methane is often sidelined. It is 80 times more potent than CO2 at warming the planet over a 20-year period, which means even a small release of methane is loaded with more global warming potential. But here’s the twist: methane is short-lived. Unlike CO2, which resides in the atmosphere for hundreds of years, methane only stays for about 12 years. That’s some good news. Researchers think that methane might hold the fastest key to slowing global warming. Therefore, if we focus on methane now, we may be able to see the difference in its atmospheric concentration and climate much sooner.</p>.<p>Agriculture, being the primary human-caused source, contributes about 40% of global emissions, and in many developing countries, where farming is central to livelihoods, it becomes a complex issue. A vital emission source is flooded rice fields, which create an anaerobic environment, making it a cosy home for the methane-emitting microbes. Through enteric fermentation, cows also release methane. In this natural process, microbes in their stomach break down the food and produce methane as a by-product. Then, there is stored manure which acts as a methane generator.</p>.<p>However, methane’s impact does not just stop at warming the planet. It is also responsible for the formation of ground-level ozone, a pollutant that affects the respiratory system, as well as the ecosystem and vegetation, which makes it a public health and food security issue as well. A crucial point to note here is that methane’s impact has become much broader, and its story deserves immediate attention.</p>.<p>So, how do we measure methane emissions? Even today, our methods are limited. Life Cycle Assessment or LCA is useful when evaluating the emissions from a product across its life cycle. There are bottom-up methods that count emissions from farms, landfills, etc., using emission factors, such as N cows = X kg methane per year, to estimate the total. Then, there are top-down methods using satellites to observe and scan methane in the atmosphere. Often, these two methods do not agree, and satellites sometimes show more methane than the reports from bottom-up methods might suggest.</p>.IIT Guwahati develops tech to convert methane, carbon dioxide into eco-friendly biofuel.<p><strong>Climate-smart agriculture</strong></p>.<p>However, the bright side is that solutions exist, and many of them are implementable. For example, intermittent irrigation and alternate wetting and drying methods in rice fields might help cut methane emissions and save us a lot of water, which can be a win-win. Cows can be fed more easily digestible high-quality forages and seaweed-based additives along with the addition of fats and oils in their diets, which could reduce emissions. Biogas digesters can be used to turn manure into clean energy.</p>.<p>All these methods fall under the broader umbrella of climate-smart agriculture, which aims to increase food productivity while mitigating climate change, thereby integrating farming into the climate solution. This is not just theoretical – India is already forging ahead through initiatives like the National Biogas Mission, which seeks to expand renewable energy from agricultural waste. Also, while India is not yet a signatory to the Global Methane Pledge (where over 150 countries have signed to cut down methane by 30% by 2030), its domestic strategic efforts are moving in a constructive direction.</p>.<p>Yet, the path forward is not without obstacles. Much of the methane data and mitigation models come from advanced industrial economies. For regions like South Asia, we need more geographically targeted research and farmer-centric policy frameworks that centre agriculture, not overlook it. Efforts to bridge the gaps between satellite data and what is happening on the ground are also crucial.</p>.<p>So often, we talk about climate change in terms of doom and distance. However, methane is a here-and-now problem. It is one of the few areas in climate action where the science is clear, technology exists, and the window for observable outcomes is brief. Tackling methane won’t solve everything going on with climate change. However, it buys us time, thereby giving us a chance to slow down the warming. At the same time, we continue the longer, harder work of decarbonisation. Indeed, methane is the hidden climate culprit we can tame, a solution in waiting, and the time to act is now.</p>.<p><em>(Anand is an assistant professor and programme coordinator–Climate Science & Policy at TERI School of Advanced Studies, New Delhi; Arundhati holds an MSc degree from Guru Nanak Dev University, Amritsar)</em></p>",2025-04-17T00:09:00.000+03:00,https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/methane-a-hidden-climate-culprit-3497270,Anand Madhukar,positive

"Yo me enfrenté al feminicida, por mí el criminal está en la cárcel: madre de víctima - La Crónica de Hoy México","Se cumplió un año de la muerte de María José, la última víctima de Miguel “N”, e“feminicida de Iztacalco”, tiempo el el que su madre, Cassandra, le ha reprochado a la Fiscalía capitalina que desde el 2021 la institución tenía denuncias de que el asesino podría ser el responsable de múltiples desapariciones de mujeres, sin embargo, fue hasta la última muerte que comenzaron las investigaciones, cuando de no haber sido por su valentía de enfrentar al criminal, más ciudadanas estarían muertas.
Sumado a su dolor, narró, no pudo obtener justicia dado que el proceso legal para realizarle las imputaciones penales, peritajes y toma de declaraciones presentó diversas irregularidades, en las que inclusive, el Ministerio Público dejó que pasaran fechas importantes para la entrega de avances en las indagatorias, con las que a Miguel se le señalaría de violación, no únicamente de secuestro; por lo tanto, en las próximas audiencias a las que sería sometido el feminicida, pudo haber recibido una sentencia de menos años de prisión que los merecidos a causa de las negligencias.
Afuera del Panteón Español, donde se realizó la misa para conmemorar el fallecimiento de la joven, su mamá, Cassandra, narró lo que nombraron un acto de valentía, cuando impidió la muerte de su hija el 16 de abril del 2024. Con el dolor tuvo que soportar las burlas en una llamada telefónica que les realizó Miguel “N”, días previos a su muerte, denuncia que también la Fiscalía ignoró.
“Dijo (en la llamada) que estaba triste por lo que nos había hecho, no podía creer que ya había pasado un año de lo que nos había hecho. No se arrepiente de lo que le hizo a mi hermana y mucho menos a las demás víctimas, le dije que era un asesino y él soltó una carcajada”, dijo Fernanda, hermana de María José.
“Me aseguró que vienen más víctimas, que no solamente eran ocho. Al otro día hice mi declaración, me parece increíble que el domingo amanezca muerto. Nos enteramos de la muerte de Miguel por la televisión, la Fiscalía no se ha puesto en contacto con nosotros”, agregó su madre, Cassandra.
Inclusive, Ángela Calles, tía de María José, recordó que gracias a Cassandra, Miguel fue obligado a dejar su vida criminal, “doce años duró desapareciendo y asesinando víctimas”, subrayó.
“Ella estuvo un mes en el hospital, con 50 por ciento de probabilidad de sobrevivir, vean su cuello cómo está, nacer y vivir en México es un peligro, porque las autoridades no escuchan a las víctimas”.
“Mi hermana es una heroína, que se enfrentó cuerpo a cuerpo con él, cualquier madre lo haría, queremos respuestas. La Fiscalía la ha llamado una y otra vez para que diga qué fue lo que pasó”.
Cassandra narró el día en que observó la manera en que Miguel “N” asesinó a su hija, lugar de fallecimiento que califica como el más seguro donde se debía de sentir, es decir, su hogar.
“Mi hija murió en su propia cama, en el lugar más seguro; la dejé dormir un rato más, la encontré semidesnuda y él estaba sobre ella. Le pregunté ¿Qué le hiciste? Y me empezó a apuñalar; tuve mucho miedo porque sabía que ella hasta ahí había llegado (María José). Por un milagro sobreviví, nunca me caí, me tuvo que ahorcar para tumbarme”, dijo mientras lloraba.
Detalló que una vez que recuperó el conocimiento, abrió la puerta de su casa a los vecinos que escucharon los gritos durante el asesinaro y les indicó que se trataba de Miguel, primera vez que fue detenido.
La tía de la víctima evidenció que siempre que su defensa le cuestionaba al Ministerio Público en qué momento trabajarían para llevar el caso a un juicio y proceder a la sentencia condenatoria por las muertes, era ignorada o le notifican de fechas erróneas; en suma, la Fiscalía no las apoyó en los gastos legales y funerarios para buscar que la última víctima obtenga justicia.",2025-04-17T01:13:00.000+03:00,https://www.cronica.com.mx/metropoli/2025/04/16/yo-me-enfrente-al-feminicida-por-mi-el-criminal-esta-en-la-carcel-madre-de-victima,Por Jorge Aguilar,positive

"With strong Senate support, Florida moves closer to statewide fluoride ban","Nation
With strong Senate support, Florida moves closer to statewide fluoride ban
Florida is on its way to becoming the second state in the country to ban adding fluoride to public drinking water, parting with a practice once regarded among the greatest public health achievements of the last century.
The Republican-controlled state Senate approved a wide-ranging agricultural bill Wednesday that includes a provision ceasing fluoridation by cities and counties. The vote was 27-9.
The bill now goes to the Florida House, which is also GOP-controlled and where similar legislation has received favorable votes in committee. If approved, it would then head to Gov. Ron DeSantis' office, who almost certainly would sign the prohibition into law.
""We're here to hydrate, not medicate,"" said state Sen. Keith Truenow, R-Tavares, who sponsored the bill, before the vote. ""Here in Florida, we are saying no additives can be used in purifying water.""
Opponents of a statewide ban said it would lead to more tooth decay and other health issues, especially among young children in poor communities.
""This would honestly be a joke, if it didn't have dangerous consequences,"" said Tina Scott Polsky, D-Boca Raton, on the Senate floor before voting against the bill. ""Are any of us chemists? None of here are doctors. None of us are dentists.""
The Florida Senate's move follows Utah, which became the first state last month to enact its ban. The state did so just weeks after Robert F. Kennedy Jr. - who has long expressed suspicion about the safety of water fluoridation - became secretary of Health and Human Services.
Ending fluoridation, once a fringe issue, has gained increasing support across Florida after state Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo last August spoke against injecting the cavity-fighting mineral into drinking water. He pointed to a study that found fluoride is linked to lower IQ in children.
Ladapo also has argued that adding fluoride to public water is no longer necessary because toothpaste and mouthwash provide protection against tooth decay.
However, health experts say the studies Ladapo cites regarding toxicity involve fluoridation at much higher levels than what is allowed in public water systems in the United States, roughly 0.7 parts per million - about three drops in a 55-gallon barrel of water.
The National Institutes of Health has said it is ""virtually impossible"" to get toxic levels of fluoride from water with that amount of fluoride.
The American Dental Association has said that Ladapo was ""misinformed and making dangerous"" comments. The organization also pointed out that toothpaste supplements fluoridated water for good dental health.
Since 1945, fluoride - a mineral naturally found in water and the soil - has been added to public drinking water systems across the country after it was discovered it helped prevent cavities and help prevent other forms of tooth decay.
Health experts and agencies - including the American Dental Association, American Academy of Pediatrics and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention - have endorsed fluoridation as a way of providing poor children with a measure of dental care, who otherwise could not afford to go to a dentist.
But in the past several months, at least 14 Florida cities have agreed to discontinue fluoridation - including Lake Mary, Longwood, Tavares and Leesburg.
Last week, Seminole County became the largest utility provider in Central Florida to stop adding fluoride to its drinking water supply before distributing it to roughly 40,000 customers.
In a 4-1 vote, Seminole commissioners made the move after several people spoke against fluoridation at recent meetings. However, several health professionals strongly urged Seminole's leaders to continue it.
Today, only about one sixth of Florida's 23 million residents live in communities without fluoride in their water.
It's unclear whether the proposed legislation would apply to private utilities, such as neighborhoods with their own water distribution systems. According to the bill, the use ""of any additive in a public water system"" that does not improve water quality or remove contaminants would be prohibited.",2025-04-17T00:44:00.000+03:00,https://www.mahoningmatters.com/news/nation-world/national/article304388166.html,"Martin E.

State House panel OKs $75 million for northern Michigan ice storm relief,"Nation
State House panel OKs $75 million for northern Michigan ice storm relief
LANSING, Mich. - A Michigan House committee on Wednesday advanced a bill that would push about $75 million toward a relief fund for northern Michigan to address the effects of the area's historic ice storm in late March.
The $75 million appropriation for the Michigan State Police would be used to assist ""individual residents, businesses, and communities that have realized a significant financial hardship caused by recent storm damage,"" according to a nonpartisan House Fiscal Agency analysis of the bill.
The money also would be used as a 25% match to draw down a $225 million federal hazard mitigation grant through the Federal Emergency Management Agency if a federal disaster is declared in Michigan. Last week, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer asked President Donald Trump to issue a presidential emergency declaration for 12 northern Michigan counties and the Little Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa Indians affected by the storms that knocked out power for tens of thousands of residents.
FEMA's hazard mitigation money typically is used, according to the federal agency, to support ""sustained measures enacted to reduce or eliminate long-term risk to people and property from natural hazards and their effects.""
Northern Michigan communities are ""doing everything they can"" to recover from the storm, but it is apparent more federal help is needed, said state Rep. Parker Fairbairn, a Harbor Springs Republican who introduced the bill.
""After a once-in-a-generation storm, we need a lot more than calloused hands and work boots to get things back to normal,"" Fairbairn said in a statement. ""We're talking about Michiganders who have dutifully paid their taxes for generations; the least the state can do is return some of those dollars in our hour of need.""
Whitmer declared a state of emergency in northern Michigan on March 31. She deployed the Michigan National Guard to aid in recovery efforts and declared an energy emergency in the Upper Peninsula to aid in the delivery of fuel and other resources. On Friday, she requested Trump to declare a presidential emergency declaration.
In the governor's letter to Trump last week, Whitmer said electric utility cooperatives have estimated their response costs related to the storm will exceed $65 million; that sum does not include municipal or private utilities that are not eligible for federal aid. The state's costs are estimated to be more than $7 million, and local and tribal government costs have not yet been calculated.
The actual costs, when the damage to local infrastructure, businesses and residents is taken into account, are expected to be much higher than the $72 million already accounted for in utility and state expenses.
Several socioeconomic factors for the area - such as an elderly population, higher poverty rates and unemployment - are likely to make an efficient recovery difficult without some aid, Whitmer wrote.
The state is expected to begin a formal joint preliminary damage assessment next week of Northern Michigan with FEMA and the U.S. Small Business Administration to determine whether damage meets the threshold needed for a major disaster declaration and the individual and public assistance available through that declaration.
As of Wednesday, at least 2,200 residents were still without power, according to data from Presque Isle Electric & Gas, one of the hardest hit utilities during the outage. Another 317 customers lacked electricity, according to the Great Lakes Energy Electric Cooperative. And more than 150 customers are without power in the eastern Upper Peninsula, according to the Cloverland Electric Cooperative.",2025-04-17T00:51:00.000+03:00,https://www.mahoningmatters.com/news/nation-world/national/article304389096.html,"Beth LeBlanc, The Detroit News",positive
中国援塞体育场维修项目顺利移交 _ 东方财富网,"近日，中国援塞内加尔4个体育场维修项目竣工移交仪式在塞首都达喀尔市中心的桑戈尔体育场举行。该项目自2022年开工，涵盖桑戈尔体育场及考拉克、久尔贝勒、济金绍尔3个地方体育场的升级改造。其中，桑戈尔体育场于20世纪80年代由中国政府援建，经过此次结构加固、设施更新等系统性改造，成为该国最现代化的体育场之一。其余3座地方场馆也得到升级，为推动塞内加尔全民健身事业发展注入强劲动能。

La revista Time eligió a Javier Milei entre las 100 personalidades más influyentes del año,"La revista Time incluyó al presidente Javier Milei en su tradicional lista de las 100 personas más influyentes del mundo. Por segundo año consecutivo, el mandatario argentino fue seleccionado en la categoría “Líderes”, donde comparte espacio con figuras de alto perfil como Donald Trump, Elon Musk y la presidenta de México, Claudia Sheinbaum.
Mirá También: Javier Milei declaró en conjunto con el secretario del Tesoro de Estados Unidos, Scott Bessent: “Una inflación fuera de control y una alta tasa de desempleo”
Milei es el único argentino presente en esta edición del listado, que fue publicado este miércoles y está dividido en seis categorías: Líderes, Titanes, Íconos, Innovadores, Pioneros y Artistas.
El análisis de Time sobre el trabajo de Javier Milei
El perfil de Javier Milei fue escrito por Ian Bremmer, politólogo, analista internacional y editor general de la revista, quien destacó el “giro drástico” en la conducción económica argentina desde que el economista libertario llegó al poder.
“En 2023, Milei era visto como un outsider armado con una motosierra. Veinte meses después, quienes lo subestimamos —yo incluido— nos vemos obligados a reconsiderar”, escribió Bremmer.
La publicación subraya dos logros centrales de su gestión: la fuerte desaceleración de la inflación y la baja en los índices de pobreza. En números, Time señala que la inflación pasó de un 289% interanual en abril de 2024 a 66,9% en febrero de 2025, y que la pobreza cayó del 52,9% al 38,1% en el mismo período.
Según el artículo, el fenómeno Milei se inscribe en una tendencia global donde los ciudadanos, agobiados por la suba del costo de vida, rechazan a los partidos tradicionales. “Milei es el dirigente del G20 que asumió los mayores riesgos en su intento por corregir el rumbo de su nación… y eso está funcionando”, sostuvo el analista.
El texto concluye con una reflexión sobre el contexto político argentino: “El sistema político argentino estuvo roto durante décadas. Parece que hacía falta alguien que realmente supiera cómo arreglarlo”.
La reacción de Javier Milei por la mención de la revista Time
Tras la publicación de la lista, el Presidente reaccionó en su cuenta de X con un mensaje que generó revuelo: “Fenómeno barrial. Dolor en Mandrilandia. ¿Qué dirán los imbéciles que ponen a las formas por sobre el contenido? ¿Déficit de IQ, pereza o sobre?”, escribió, fiel a su estilo provocador.
Mirá También: El comunicado del Tesoro de Estados Unidos tras la reunión con Javier Milei: “Lo felicitamos por sus audaces reformas”
La mención en Time refuerza la proyección internacional del mandatario libertario, que ya ha captado la atención de los principales medios del mundo por su estilo disruptivo y las reformas profundas que promueve desde la Casa Rosada.",2025-04-17T00:09:00.000+03:00,https://la100.cienradios.com/mundo/la-revista-time-eligio-a-javier-milei-entre-las-100-personalidades-mas-influyentes-del-ano,La 100,positive

Texas bill increasing public school funding and teacher pay gets initial House approval - NewsBreak,""" Texas bill increasing public school funding and teacher pay gets initial House approval "" was first published by The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan media organization that informs Texans — and engages with them — about public policy, politics, government and statewide issues. Sign up for The Brief , The Texas Tribune’s daily newsletter that keeps readers up to speed on the most essential Texas news. ​The Texas House on Wednesday gave initial approval to its priority school funding legislation. In a 144-4 vote, the lower chamber preliminary approved a bill that would increase school districts’ base money per student, raise teacher salaries and limit the use of educators without formal classroom training. House Bill 2 would also improve special education by allocating funding based on the individual needs of children with disabilities. [ Voucher vote updates: Watch the Texas House debate education savings accounts ] Republicans, during hours of debate, celebrated the bill as a worthwhile $8 billion investment in public education. Democrats also voiced support for the legislation but argued that it barely scratches the surface of what districts need. Many school districts are currently grappling with challenges ranging from budget deficits and teacher shortages to campus closures. The bill would notably increase schools’ base funding by $395 — from $6,160 to $6,555. That amount, known as the basic allotment, would automatically go up every two years by tying it to property value growth. Forty-percent of the allotment would go to salaries for school staff. Higher salary increases would go to teachers with more than a decade of classroom experience. Lawmakers sparred over other aspects of the legislation — from whether the Legislature should continue to invest heavily in compensatory education , which offers support to underserved students at risk of dropping out of school, to how the state should hold charter schools accountable for mismanagement. Upon final passage, HB 2 will go to the Senate for further consideration. That chamber has already passed a number of similar school funding proposals — though top lawmakers there have expressed opposition to increasing schools' base funding this session. The basic allotment offers districts flexibility to address the unique needs of their campuses, which includes staff salaries, utilities and maintenance. The Senate has instead advocated for more targeted funding in areas like teacher pay, school security and special education. [ Texas officials’ claim that school funding is at an all-time high ignores inflation and temporary federal money ] The House voted on the bill shortly before taking up legislation that would create school vouchers in Texas, a top priority for Gov. Greg Abbott. Two years ago, public schools missed out on nearly $8 billion, which Abbott held hostage when vouchers failed to gain the support needed to pass then. ​ Tickets are on sale now for the 15th annual Texas Tribune Festival , Texas’ breakout ideas and politics event happening Nov. 13–15 in downtown Austin.

Emir Extols Ilorin Emirate Durbar C'ttee,"Share
The Emir of Ilorin and Chairman of the Kwara State Council of Chiefs and Traditional Rulers, Ibrahim Sulu-Gambari, has commended members of the Ilorin Emirate Durbar Committee, under the chairmanship of the Danmasani of Ilorin, Suleiman Oba Yahaya Alapansanpa, for sustaining the tempo of the durbar festival since it was revived in 2018.
The Emir expressed his particular admiration for the committee, noting that they had not let him or the entire Emirate down due to their unwavering efforts to maintain the durbar festival, which he described as unique and outstanding not only across the country but beyond.
The Emir shared these sentiments when he received members of the Durbar Committee at his palace.
Ibrahim Sulu-Gambari, who offered special prayers for the committee members, also approved the commencement of preparations for this year’s durbar, which will take place on the third day of the Eid Kabir festival.
The Emir highlighted that the Ilorin Emirate Durbar has gained international recognition, as it is now embraced globally.
He called on all sons and daughters of the Emirate, as well as friends and admirers, to show their support by attending the festival in large numbers.
Sulu-Gambari acknowledged the dedication of the committee members, who often put aside personal and official duties to ensure the success of the festival.
During the courtesy visit, the Emir watched part of the 2024 durbar, which showcased the rich culture and heritage of the Ilorin Emirate, along with the achievements of its remarkable sons and daughters.
According to the monarch, the 2024 documentary demonstrated that the Ilorin Emirate Durbar is not only unique but progressively improving in standards, surpassing earlier editions.
Sulu-Gambari, who is the Chancellor of Bayero University, Kano, and Muhammad Kammaludeen University, Ilorin, commended the high standards introduced by the committee and expressed hope that future editions would continue to improve.
The Emir added that, based on media reports, the 2024 durbar was one of the best-organized events, featuring melodious Quranic recitations and cultural displays.
Earlier, the Chairman of the Committee, Yahaya Alapansanpa, the Danmasani of Ilorin, thanked the Emir for his support and confidence in the committee members.
He assured the Emir that they would continue to improve the festival each year.
Alapansanpa attributed the committee’s modest achievements to the Emir’s support and prayers, as well as the contributions, interest, and resolve of the state government to elevate the annual festival to an enviable standard.
He also emphasized the invaluable contributions of non-governmental organizations, notable individuals, and the entire Emirate.
Yahaya praised the Emir for his vision and strategic efforts to reinvigorate the durbar as a significant cultural activity in the Emirate.
The Chairman was accompanied on the royal visit by prominent members, including the Secretary, Jawondo Abdulganiyu; the Chairman of the Sub-Security Committee, Retired AIG Adisa Bolanta; former IEDPU President, Yahaya Oko Alaro Ahmed; IEDPU Publicity Secretary, Nuru Ibrahim; Treasurer, Yinka Yahaya; Aiyegbami Bushra; Ahmed Bolaji; Muhammed Jamiu; and the Chairman of the Sub-Publicity Committee, Tunde Akanbi.

Progress being made on discovery law changes in NYS Budget - NewsBreak,"ALBANY, N.Y. (NEWS10)—Governor Kathy Hochul has been holding press conferences every day this week on her proposed changes to the state’s discovery law. The die hard Buffalo Bills fan used a football analogy to describe how close they are to an agreement. “We’re not in the end zone, maybe we are on the five yard line,” said Hochul. “But I know one thing from football, you don’t spike it until the game is over or until you get the touchdown.” On Tuesday, Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie said part of the negotiations centers around a 2023 court of appeals ruling in a case called the People Versus Bay. According to Attorney Bob Babcock, the case deals with the timeframe prosecution has to share evidence with the defense. “People versus Bay is a ruling that came out that stated that if the prosecution fails to comply with its obligation to turn over discovery, which is basically evidence, in a case in a timely fashion the remedies of failure to do so can be severe all the way up to and dismissal of the charges,” explained Babcock, a Partner at Tully Rinckey. According to the governor, there has been an 26 percent increase in domestic violence cases being thrown out since 2019. Heastie said he’s been working with district attorneys. “DA Bragg brought up a case where a domestic violence victim’s case was dismissed because there was a picture that I think the victim’s best friend had taken and the prosecution turned that over and that led to a dismissal,” said Heastie. “We kinda used that kind of case to get us to where we needed to be.” Some lawmakers have worried that changes to the state’s discovery law could result in wrongful convictions. The speaker mentioned on Tuesday that prejudice would be a factor for judges to consider.

一季度国内生产总值同比增长5.4% 中国经济开门红 应对外部挑战有底气_新闻频道_中国青年网,"2025年一季度，中国经济实现开门红。
“国民经济实现良好开局，高质量发展向新向好。”在国新办4月16日举行的新闻发布会上，国家统计局副局长盛来运介绍，初步核算，一季度国内生产总值（GDP）318758亿元，按不变价格计算，同比增长5.4%，比上年四季度环比增长1.2%。
在全球主要经济体中名列前茅
“增长”一词在这场发布会上频频出现。工业被喻为国民经济的“压舱石”。一季度，我国工业生产增长加快，全国规模以上工业增加值同比增长6.5%，比去年全年加快0.7个百分点。
3月份，全国规模以上工业增加值同比增长7.7%。中泰证券研究所政策组首席分析师杨畅注意到，在去年工业生产基数较高的情况下，今年3月仍然实现了较高增速，表明我国工业生产仍然很强。
消费、投资、出口被视为拉动经济增长的“三驾马车”，其中，消费是拉动经济增长的“主引擎”。民生银行首席经济学家温彬认为，我国经济开年运行平稳，尽管外需有所放缓，但政策发力对内需形成提振。
一季度，消费在政策的推动下持续改善。社会消费品零售总额为124671亿元，同比增长4.6%，比上年全年加快1.1个百分点。
在投资方面，一季度，全国固定资产投资（不含农户）103174亿元，同比增长4.2%，比上年全年加快1个百分点。扣除房地产开发投资，全国固定资产投资增长8.3%。
盛来运指出，前期出台的宏观政策和今年以来扩容加码的增量政策叠加发力，有效扩大了需求、促进了生产、激发了活力、增强了信心。3月份，制造业采购经理人指数是50.5%，环比上升了0.3个百分点，连续两个月回升。
一系列政策举措为民营企业投资创造公平的营商环境，民间投资由上年全年下降转为增长。民营企业的活力动力不断显现，一季度制造业中的民间投资同比增长9.7%，基础设施投资中的民间投资增长9.3%，均比各自领域的平均增速快。
此外，盛来运表示，一季度GDP同比增长5.4%，增速高于去年全国5%的增速，也高于去年一季度5.3%的增速，还高于不少全球主要经济体一季度的经济增速，在全球主要经济体中名列前茅。在全球经济增长乏力的情况下，中国将为世界经济的稳定发挥重要作用。
高质量发展持续向新向好
一季度，中国经济在实现“量”的合理增长的同时，新质生产力也在培育壮大，高质量发展向新向好的大势没有改变。
5个维度反映出这一趋势。盛来运介绍，第一个维度是创新持续推进，新质生产力培育壮大。第二个维度是协调发展持续改善。第三个维度是高水平开放继续推进。第四个维度是绿色转型、绿色发展扎实推进。第五个维度是民生改善和安全发展继续取得新进展。
一季度，各地方加大对创新的支持力度，尤其是人工智能、量子科技等一批先进技术不断推出和应用，带动了高技术产业发展。DeepSeek、宇树人形机器人等一批成果的应用，既彰显了中国科技创新的实力，同时也增强了市场的信心。
新兴产业正在蓬勃发展。一季度，新能源汽车、3D打印设备、工业机器人产品产量同比分别增长45.4%、44.9%、26.0%。
盛来运指出，一季度，规模以上高技术制造业增加值同比增长9.7%，信息传输、软件和信息技术服务业增加值增长10.3%，这两个数据也显示出我国创新动力在增强。
工业向高端化、智能化、绿色化转型的趋势明显。从需求结构来看，当下我国投资增速实际上不高，但是高技术产业投资比重是在提升的。一季度，高技术产业投资同比增长6.5%，占全部投资的比重为10.3%，提高0.3个百分点。
民生改善和安全发展继续取得新进展。政府高度重视加大民生方面的支出，对民生方面的支出占比持续提高。能源保供有力有效，一季度就业形势总体稳定，城镇调查失业率稳中略降。一季度末，外出务工农村劳动力总量18795万人，同比增长1.1%。
此外，全国城镇调查失业率平均值为5.3%。居民收入增长与经济增长基本同步。一季度，全国居民人均可支配收入12179元，同比名义增长5.5%，扣除价格因素实际增长5.6%。
安全发展得到加强。作为防风险的重点领域，房地产行业也出现了不少积极变化。1-3月，全国新建商品房销售面积21869万平方米，同比下降3.0%，降幅比1-2月收窄2.1个百分点；新建商品房销售额20798亿元，下降2.1%，降幅收窄0.5个百分点。
“房地产止跌回稳的态势明显。”广东省城规院住房政策研究中心首席研究员李宇嘉说，一季度，房地产行业从上游开工到下游销售，相关的跌幅明显收窄。
有底气、有信心、有能力应对外部挑战
近期，美国“对等关税”风波愈演愈烈。面对冲击，我国外贸韧性依然强劲。今年一季度，我国货物贸易进出口10.3万亿元，同比增长1.3%。其中，出口6.13万亿元，增长6.9%。
“我们坚决反对美国搞关税壁垒和贸易霸凌，这种做法损人不利己，违背了经济规律和世界贸易的原则，对世界经济秩序造成严重冲击，拖累世界经济复苏。”盛来运表示，中方坚决采取一系列反制措施，不仅是维护自身发展利益的需要，也是维护世界多边贸易体系和世贸组织规则的正当之举。
谈及加征高额关税对中国的影响，盛来运说：“从短期来看，美国加征高额关税会对我国经济和外贸带来一定压力，但是改变不了中国经济持续长期向好的大势。中国经济基础稳、优势多、韧性强、潜力大，我们有底气、有信心、有能力应对外部挑战，实现既定发展目标。”
盛来运说，中国经济有基础，内需有支撑。中国是世界第二大经济体，连续15年稳居第一制造业大国的地位，产业体系完整、配套能力强，经济发展底盘稳、基础牢。同时，中国有14亿多人口，市场规模巨大，人均GDP超过1.3万美元，正处在消费升级的关键阶段，市场成长性好，无论是投资还是消费空间都非常大，将支撑中国经济持续发展。他指出，我国依靠内需和创新驱动共同推动经济增长的新格局正在形成。
目前，我国已成为150多个国家和地区的重要贸易伙伴，外贸多元化市场格局正在形成，这意味着我国对某一个国家单一出口市场的依存度在下降。盛来运举例，2018年，我国对美国的出口额占出口总额的比重是19.2%，去年已经下降到14.7%。
针对当前的外部变化，我国应对有经验，并且政策有保障。盛来运谈到，当下，一揽子政策正在发力显效，“下阶段会根据外部形势的变化及时推出增量政策，丰富的政策‘工具箱’是应对外部的冲击和挑战的保障”。
此外，中国的企业家敢闯敢拼，中国人民智慧勤劳，都是我国应对巨大风险挑战的基础和底气。“我们对中国经济后期的走势以及发展的前景充满信心。”盛来运说。

Ojulari Pledges Strategic Collaboration To Deliver Mandate,"Share
The Group Chief Executive Officer of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPC Ltd), Bashir Bayo Ojulari, has reaffirmed his commitment to forging strong and effective partnerships with key stakeholders to successfully deliver on the strategic mandate entrusted to him by President Bola Ahmed Tinubu.
Ojulari made this pledge during a courtesy visit to the Honourable Minister of Petroleum Resources (Oil), Senator Heineken Lokpobiri, on Wednesday, according to a statement by the Chief Corporate Communications Officer of NNPC Ltd, Olufemi Soneye.
The GCEO emphasized a shared vision of progress and performance for Nigeria’s oil and gas industry.
He noted that he and his executive leadership team are stepping into office with a spirit of collaboration and a deep resolve to make a lasting impact.
He further stressed that NNPC Ltd’s success will depend on close synergy with the Ministry of Petroleum, the Ministry of Finance, and other relevant institutions to break through bureaucratic barriers and accelerate results.
“We are here with a mindset of partnership—partnership with the Ministry of Petroleum Resources, with the Ministry of Finance, and with all other critical stakeholders. Our goal is to bridge gaps, foster alignment, and move forward with a united front. Antagonism benefits no one; collaboration is how we win,” Ojulari stated.
In response, Lokpobiri expressed strong confidence in the new leadership of NNPC Ltd. He noted that he has known many members of the management team personally and has received outstanding reports about their professional capabilities.
“This is arguably the strongest leadership team NNPC Ltd has ever assembled. Now is the time to translate that reputation into measurable results—especially in increasing crude oil production and ensuring the sector delivers optimal value to the Nigerian people,” Lokpobiri said.
The Minister assured Ojulari of his unwavering support and strategic guidance. He added that his office would work closely with the GCEO to provide the enabling environment for NNPC Ltd to thrive and deliver on its national mandate.
“This renewed spirit of partnership signals a new chapter for the oil and gas industry, marked by purposeful collaboration, operational excellence, and a shared commitment to national development.”

NSIA Remains Unfazed: Aminu Umar-Sadiq Assures Stability Amidst Global Economic Volatility,"ABUJA – Aminu Umar-Sadiq, the Managing Director of the Nigerian Sovereign Investment Authority (NSIA), has assured that the current global economic volatility resulting from ongoing tariff wars will not negatively impact the Authority’s operations.
Speaking at NSIA’s 2024 Earnings Presentation to journalists, Umar-Sadiq emphasized that the Authority’s assets have been strategically allocated to protect it from market uncertainties. This comes as US President Donald Trump’s tariff impositions on various goods and services have triggered reciprocal measures, creating instability in the global economy.
“If you look at our strategic assets’ allocation on the stabilization and the future generations fund side, you will see it is defensive. We have allocations to private equity, we have allocations to hedge funds, and we have allocations to real estate, inflation-linked funds,” Umar-Sadiq explained.
“And so, whilst on the upside, where the markets are roaring, we may not be fully optimizing, what it does is that it protects us on the downside, which is very, very important, because if you look at the mandate of our sovereign wealth fund, it is largely a savings mandate.”
According to documents provided by NSIA, total assets increased by 96% to ₦4.42 trillion in December 2024 from ₦2.26 trillion in December 2023, demonstrating steady asset growth aligned with equity strength.
This remarkable growth was attributed to increased returns from associates and joint venture entities, net gains on collateralized securities, and net foreign exchange gains resulting from naira depreciation.
The NSIA has maintained profitability for the 12th consecutive year, closing 2024 with a Total Comprehensive Income (TCI) of ₦1.89 trillion, bringing cumulative retained earnings to ₦3.74 trillion.
Total operating profits, excluding share of profits from associates and Joint Venture entities, grew from ₦1.17 trillion in 2023 to ₦1.86 trillion in 2024.
Umar-Sadiq revealed that since its establishment in 2011, the Authority has received a total of $1.82 billion in net government contributions. “These funds have been efficiently utilized by NSIA resulting in a Net Asset Value (NAV) of $2.84 billion as at December, 2024,” he stated.
The NSIA was created by an Act of the National Assembly signed into law by the President on May 26, 2011. Its ownership structure shows that the Federal government holds 46.5 percent, States 34.8 percent, Local Government Areas 18.2 percent, while the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) has 0.5 percent respectively.
The Authority’s Core TCI (excluding foreign exchange and derivative valuation gains) rose by 148% to ₦407.9 billion in 2024, supported by robust returns on financial assets measured at fair value through profit and loss23. This includes returns from collateralized securities, private equity, hedge funds, and Exchange-Traded Funds.
“The Authority’s outstanding financial performance in 2024 reflects the strength of our strategic vision, disciplined execution and unwavering commitment to sustainable socio-economic advancement,” Umar-Sadiq remarked.
“As we move forward, we remain focused on driving economic transformation, expanding opportunities, scaling transformative impact and ensuring long-term prosperity for current and future generations of Nigerians.”",2025-04-17T00:10:00.000+03:00,https://independent.ng/nsia-remains-unfazed-aminu-umar-sadiq-assures-stability-amidst-global-economic-volatility,Kayode Ajiboye,positive

"Nigeria, South Africa Sign Pact On Mining Development","In a bid to solidify the partnership fostered through the Nigeria–South Africa Bi-National Commission—recently inaugurated by President Bola Ahmed Tinubu and President Cyril Ramaphosa—the Ministers of Solid Minerals of both nations have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) outlining key areas of cooperation, complete with implementation timelines.
During a bilateral meeting at his office in Abuja, the Minister of Solid Minerals Development, Dr. Dele Alake, hosted South Africa’s Minister of Mineral Resources and Energy, H.E. Gwede Mantashe. Dr. Alake described the engagement as a milestone in deepening bilateral relations, especially in the vital mining sector.
Reflecting on the historical ties between the two countries, Alake noted the longstanding diplomatic and economic cooperation built on mutual respect and a shared vision for Africa’s development. He stressed that collaboration in the mining sector offers vast opportunities for industrialization, job creation, and sustainable growth across the continent.
“The Memorandum of Understanding in geology, mining, and mineral processing signed today,” Alake stated, “will serve as a cornerstone for facilitating knowledge and technology transfer, investment promotion, capacity building, regional integration, and value addition.”
Key Highlights of the MoU Include:
Capacity building in geological applications using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) Utilization of Multi- and Hyper-spectral Remote Sensing Technologies for mineral exploration and geological mapping Sharing of geoscientific data on strategic minerals through the Nigeria Geological Survey Agency (NGSA) Training on mineral processing and value addition Capacity Building on Elemental Fingerprint Technology using LA-ICP-MS Exploration of Agro and Energy Minerals In Nigeria Alake emphasized Nigeria’s renewed focus on developing its mining industry, stating that South Africa could benefit from Nigeria’s vast mineral wealth, while Nigeria could tap into South Africa’s advanced mining expertise. This synergy, he said, would open doors to investment, skills development, and economic diversification.
In his remarks, H.E. Gwede Mantashe affirmed that South Africa—where mining plays a central role in the economy—stands to gain from Nigeria’s revitalized interest in the sector. He added that his visit aimed to fine-tune agreements from the Bi-National Commission and to deepen collaboration on mutually beneficial projects with Nigeria’s Ministry of Solid Minerals Development.
Both ministers committed to sustained engagement and collaboration to boost intra-African trade and deliver on the actionable steps outlined in the MoU. They expressed confidence that this renewed partnership would significantly enhance the mining sectors of both countries.
The MoU signing was attended by the Minister of Steel Development, Shuaibu Audu; Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Solid Minerals Development, Dr. Mary Ogbe; Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Steel Development, Dr. Chris Isokpunwu; alongside senior officials from both solid minerals and steel development ministries and members of the South African delegation led by H.E.

Arkansas Takes Bold Step Against PBM Ownership of Pharmacies,"Arkansas Takes Bold Step Against PBM Ownership of Pharmacies
Lucas YoungUpdated: 04-16-2025 06:15 PM
Arkansas Enacts Landmark Law Against PBM Ownership
In a momentous decision benefiting patients and community pharmacies, a progressive law has been signed in Arkansas, marking an unprecedented shift in state pharmacy regulations. The recent legislation prohibits pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) from owning or operating pharmacies within the state, effectively protecting public health and enhancing access to vital pharmacy care for Arkansans.
The Implications of HB 1150
With the approval of HB 1150, Arkansas has made a significant policy change that will reshape how pharmacies operate in the state starting January 1, 2026. This new law emerged from dedicated advocacy by organizations like the Arkansas Pharmacists Association (APA) and the National Community Pharmacists Association (NCPA), both of which emphasized the negative impact of PBM ownership on community pharmacies.
The APA, representing the interests of Arkansas pharmacists, has tirelessly championed HB 1150's passage, highlighting the urgent need for reforms in the pharmacy landscape. Their efforts align with those of the NCPA, which has consistently sought to curb the anticompetitive practices associated with vertically integrated PBMs that often lead to patient harm and increased prescription drug prices.
Understanding PBMs and Their Impact on Pharmacy Care
Pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs, have faced scrutiny for creating hurdles in patient care through abusive practices. These include imposing restrictive contract terms on independent pharmacies, clawbacks that undermine reimbursements, and controlling patient access, which stifles competition and hinders pharmacists' ability to provide high-quality service. The passage of HB 1150 aims to dismantle these barriers, paving the way for better patient outcomes.
“This legislation marks a pivotal moment for pharmacies and patients alike,” said John Vinson, CEO of the APA. He emphasized that the bipartisan support for HB 1150 reflects a collective commitment to safeguard public health, ensuring that pharmacies affiliated with PBMs no longer exploit their position at the detriment of patients.
Nationwide Support for Reform
Following Arkansas's lead, similar legislative actions concerning PBM ownership have emerged in states like Indiana, New York, Texas, and Vermont. Moreover, a bipartisan coalition of state attorneys general has voiced support for stringent reforms, urging federal lawmakers to adopt policies that prevent PBMs from owning or operating pharmacies. A recent bipartisan bill introduced in Congress highlights a growing recognition of the need to address the issues related to PBM ownership.
Anne Cassity, NCPA’s Senior Vice President of Government Affairs, commented on the legislation's potential impact, stating, “The introduction of HB 1150 represents a vital step toward transparency and fair practices in pharmacy care. This structural change aims to eliminate the inherent conflicts of interest exploited by PBMs, benefiting patients and pharmacists across the nation.”
The Long Road to Pharmacy Reform
The path to instituting such measures has not been without challenges. Both the APA and NCPA have encountered resistance from powerful PBM entities resistant to substantive reforms. However, the overwhelming support for HB 1150 underscores a collective commitment among pharmacists, advocates, and legislators to change the status quo. The hope is that similar victories will soon be celebrated nationwide.
Future of Pharmacy Ownership in the U.S.
The passing of HB 1150 in Arkansas initiates a new chapter in the ongoing fight for pharmacy independence and patient access to care. By prohibiting PBM ownership, the state is setting a precedent that signals a shifting paradigm in healthcare where patient welfare is paramount.
This legislation not only aims to protect Arkansans but also serves as a compelling example for other states grappling with similar issues. The impacts of this law will reverberate throughout the healthcare system, enhancing the collaborative roles of pharmacists in integrated healthcare and potentially inspiring broader change across the nation.
Frequently Asked Questions
What does HB 1150 entail?
HB 1150 prohibits PBMs from owning pharmacies in Arkansas, aiming to enhance patient access to quality pharmacy care.
Why is this legislation important for pharmacy care?
The law aims to eliminate conflicts of interest arising from PBM ownership that negatively impacts prices and patient care.
How does this affect other states?
Arkansas's law could influence similar legislation in other states seeking to manage PBM practices and protect community pharmacies.
Who supported the passage of HB 1150?
The APA and NCPA strongly advocated for this legislation, along with numerous community pharmacists and supportive legislators.
What future changes can be expected in pharmacy regulations?
With the passage of HB 1150, other states may consider similar reforms, potentially leading to a nationwide shift in pharmacy practices and ownership regulations.

"创新检侨协同机制 打造法治护侨""南京实践""|检察院_新浪财经_新浪网","依法维护侨胞合法权益，是新时代法治建设的关键一环，也是凝聚侨心、汇聚侨力的重要举措。近年来，南京市侨联联合市检察院认真贯彻落实最高检、中国侨联和江苏省检察院、江苏省侨联关于深化检侨合作的部署要求，以创新为驱动，以服务为宗旨，全力构建检侨合作新模式，为侨胞侨企发展保驾护航。4月，江苏省检察院、江苏省侨联召开全省检侨合作推进会，南京市检侨合作成果在会上作经验交流分享，事例获评全省检侨合作典型事例。
完善工作机制，党建赋能提升效能
制度建设是推动检侨合作的基石。南京市侨联与市检察院联合出台了《关于加强新时代检侨联络机制的意见》，从涉侨案件办理、权益保护、纠纷化解等多维度入手，建立起包括法治宣讲、快速办理、检察监督在内的8项工作机制，为侨胞权益保障编织了一张严密的法治网，为全市检侨合作明确了方向。
为确保合作机制有效运行，南京市侨联与市检察院搭建起沟通协作桥梁。市区两级检察院选派多人担任市侨联法律顾问委员会副主任，市侨联指定专职干部担任合作联络员，市区两级检察院和侨联均设立专门的牵头部门与联络人，通过常态化的信息共享、案件通报与座谈研讨，实现涉侨诉求“一站式”对接，让侨胞的问题有处可寻、有门可入。
党建引领是拓展检侨合作的重要动力。南京市侨联联合市检察院等18家单位成立“宁心惠侨”党建联盟，秉持“整合资源、服务中心”的理念，开展各类活动10余场。通过党建工作联做、中心工作联促、实践活动联办，将党建优势转化为服务侨胞的工作效能，开创检侨合作新局面。
形成工作合力，同向聚力维护侨益
在维护侨胞合法权益的共同目标下，南京市侨联与检察机关立足职能定位，紧密协作，共同发力。检察机关在办理涉侨案件时，严格遵循法律程序，审慎适用强制措施，对情节轻微的案件依法作出公正处理，充分保障侨胞合法权益。同时，侨联积极发挥自身优势，与检察机关共同关注侵犯侨企侨胞利益的应立案未立案等问题，加强法律监督，确保侨胞侨企合法权益不受侵害。
为了畅通维权渠道，市区两级检察机关在12309检察服务中心设立了涉侨案件专窗，开通了“绿色通道”，为侨胞提供便捷高效的法律服务。此外，多个区还建立了“涉侨纠纷调解室”，吸纳侨联干部、侨界人大代表、律师等担任调解员，构建了“一案一所”对接机制与疑难案件“N+1”法律服务模式。
在此期间，侨联还不断丰富法治服务内容，提升侨胞的法治意识。侨联与检察机关联合组成了“检察官+侨联干部”普法宣讲团，借助智慧检务远程系统，打造了“线上+线下”双语普法矩阵。通过举办“普法大讲堂”、深入侨企走访等活动，发放《涉侨法律风险防范手册》，为侨胞侨企预警高发风险，提供贴心法律服务，让法治观念深入人心。
创新工作方式，激发活力助推发展
数字赋能为检侨合作注入新活力。南京市侨联联合市检察院积极探索依托数字平台创新合作模式，通过归集侨胞涉案情况与司法诉求等数据，实现检侨信息互通、联合会商、多元化解，有效提升协作效能，让数据多跑路，侨胞少跑腿。
典型案例是最好的法治教材。近年来，南京市共有9起维权案例获评全省侨界维权典型案例，累计为当事人挽回经济损失4000余万元。浦口区检察院对侵犯侨企权利的立案监督案例，不仅维护了侨胞侨企合法权益，更起到了良好的示范作用，彰显了法律的公正与威严。
文化交融促进法治认同。南京市检侨联合推出“宁侨说法”品牌栏目，设立“法治文化角”，以“图片+直播”形式讲述侨胞守法诚信故事，宣传涉侨法律法规，为侨界人士提供高质量法治教育，营造尊法学法守法用法的良好氛围。
南京市检侨合作的生动实践，是法治护航侨胞侨企发展的有力见证。下一步，南京市侨联将认真贯彻落实全省检侨合作推进会精神，会同市检察院进一步创新检侨合作模式、深化检侨合作内容，提升护侨工作实效，为凝聚侨心侨力、服务高质量发展作出更大贡献。

"Chile mantiene un primer diálogo ""directo y constructivo"" con EEUU sobre aranceles - SWI swissinfo.ch","Chile mantiene un primer diálogo «directo y constructivo» con EEUU sobre aranceles
Santiago de Chile, 16 abr (EFE).- La subsecretaria de Relaciones Económicas Internacionales de Chile, Claudia Sanhueza, dijo este miércoles que tuvo un primer «diálogo directo y constructivo» con el jefe de la Oficina del Representante Comercial de EE. UU., Jamieson Greer, tras la imposición de un arancel del 10 % a la mayoría de los productos chilenos.
«Se cumplió el objetivo. Tuvimos una buena primera reunión donde logramos establecer un diálogo directo y constructivo con el representante de Comercio de Estados Unidos, quien destacó la importancia estratégica de Chile dentro de la región para EE.UU.», indicó Sanhueza en un comunicado.
La diplomática chilena agregó en la nota que acordaron reunirse dos veces más durante el primer semestre del año con el objetivo de «facilitar el fortalecimiento de la relación económica-comercial bilateral en beneficio de ambos países, de acuerdo con lo establecido en nuestro Acuerdo de Libre Comercio vigente desde 2004».
El presidente estadounidense, Donald Trump, anunció el pasado 2 de abril un arancel global del 10 % a la gran mayoría de sus socios comerciales, incluido Chile.
El Gobierno del presiente progresista Gabriel Boric busca que Chile se libre del arancel del 10 %, como hicieron México y Canadá, ya que el país sudamericano tiene un TLC con Estados Unidos desde hace más de dos décadas y la balanza comercial es favorable al gigante norteamericano.
En 2024, el intercambio comercial entre ambos países alcanzó los 31.636 millones de dólares, según datos de la Subsecretaría de Relaciones Económicas Internacionales.
El cobre, la principal exportación chilena, está excluido de momento del arancel porque Trump ordenó en febrero una investigación para determinar si la alta dependencia de las importaciones de cobre representa un riesgo para la seguridad nacional y, en caso afirmativo, tomar medidas para restringirlas.
Chile, el mayor productor de cobre del mundo, exportó en 2024 a Estados Unidos cerca de 5.800 millones de dólares de cobre, que ingresaron al mercado norteamericano con un arancel del 0 % en virtud del TLC.
El canciller de Chile, Alberto van Klaveren, dijo este miércoles en un encuentro con corresponsales extranjeros en Santiago que «confía» en que el Gobierno de Trump «respete» el TLC.
Durante su viaje esta semana a Washington, Sanhueza se reunió también con el CEO de la International Copper Association, Juan Ignacio Díaz, y con representantes de la Cámara de Comercio de Estados Unidos (US Chamber of Commerce). EFE

"APA, NCPA Cheer First-Of-Its-Kind State Law Banning PBMs from Owning Pharmacies | User | dailytimesleader.com","Alexandria, Va., April 16, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- In a significant victory for patients and community pharmacies in Arkansas, Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders signed HB 1150 into law today. This is groundbreaking legislation that prohibits state permits to pharmacies owned by pharmacy benefit managers effective Jan. 1, 2026. The National Community Pharmacists Association, which represents the country’s independent pharmacies, supported the Arkansas Pharmacists Association’s leadership on HB 1150 as it moved through the legislative process.
APA is the voice of Arkansas pharmacists and has worked hard to advance HB 1150 and other PBM reform efforts. NCPA, which represents the country’s independent community pharmacies, has also persistently advocated that state and federal policymakers rein in the conflicts of interest and anticompetitive business practices that arise with PBMs vertically integrated upstream with health insurers and downstream with pharmacies. These practices include contract terms that restrict competitors’ access to patients, massive clawbacks, steering patients away from competing community pharmacies, below-cost reimbursements, and punitive audit practices. Prohibiting PBM ownership of pharmacies via HB 1150 would put an end to these tactics and promote Arkansans’ access to quality pharmacy care.
“Today is a new day in Arkansas for our patients as the fox will no longer guard the henhouse,” said John Vinson, APA’s chief executive officer. “This bipartisan legislation passed overwhelmingly to protect public health and safety for Arkansans. HB 1150 will stop the abusive self-dealing at PBM affiliated pharmacies that raises prescription drug prices and limits patient access. The pharmacists of Arkansas are very grateful for a courageous legislature and Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders. We also thank Attorney General Tim Griffin for his support.”
“Time and time again, PBMs have proven themselves to be resistant to transparency and reform,” said Anne Cassity, NCPA’s senior vice president of government affairs. “HB 1150 is a structural change that gets to the heart of the problem – the conflicts of interest inherent in vertical integration that PBMs have been manipulating to the detriment of patients, taxpayers, and pharmacies. We applaud HB 1150 and are eager to see its provisions implemented in Arkansas and, ideally, throughout the country.""
Since the introduction of HB 1150, similar ownership provisions were introduced or amended into bills in Indiana, New York, Texas, and Vermont. Additionally, on April 14, a bipartisan coalition of 39 state and territory attorneys general sent a letter to congressional leaders urging them to pass legislation prohibiting PBMs from owning or operating pharmacies. A bill to do so was introduced late last year by Sens. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Reps. Diana Harshbarger (R-Tenn.) – who wrote a letter in support of Arkansas HB 1150 – and Jake Auchincloss (D-Mass.).

Bill Banning Sweepstakes Progresses in Florida,"A bill banning sweepstakes gaming and increasing illegal gambling penalties passed another crucial Senate committee in Florida.
Key takeaways
● A second Senate committee approved SB 1404.
● The Senate Fiscal Policy Committee will now consider it.
● The bill would ban sweepstakes and increase illegal gambling penalties.
The Florida Senate Appropriations Committee on Agriculture, Environment, and General Government voted to give SB 1404, proposed by Sen. Corey Simon, a favorable report. This is the second favorable report from a Senate committee, and supporters now hope the Fiscal Policy Committee will similarly approve it.
Defining gambling
Simon’s bill would outlaw internet sports betting and internet gambling outside of the gaming compact Florida and the Seminole Tribe agreed to. It defines ‘internet gambling’ as a game played via the internet where users win money or an item of value based on chance.
This effectively means sweepstakes gambling, where players gamble on casino games using virtual tokens, would also be illegal, as some of the tokens can be exchanged for cash or prizes.
Daily Fantasy Sports aren't included in the proposal, though this is likely because a separate bill dealing with this form of gaming is currently going through the legislature. If Simon’s bill is passed, it would make illegal internet gambling a third-degree felony, and could become law as early as Oct. 1 this year.
Clarification required
Although the bill moved to a third committee, there were dissenting voices. Some committee members urged Simon to clarify precisely which forms of gaming would be illegal under the proposal.
Sen. Jason W.B. Pizzo and Sen. Colleen Burton voted to support the bill, but both said its language needed work, and Burton added had this been the final stage before the legislation became law, she would have voted against it.
More opposition came from representatives of the Veterans of Foreign Wars and the American Legion. Both groups use gaming machines at their member venues for charitable fund-raising, and they expressed concern the bill is unclear on whether these devices will be illegal.
Florida’s gambling rules remain complex, as the state has a unique mixture of tribal casinos and so-called racinos, which feature horse racing and casino gambling.
Sports betting is legal at physical venues the Seminole Tribe of Florida operates and its online platform, Hard Rock Bet. Still, Florida’s attempts to establish a broader sports betting market have stalled in the legislature.
Last October, the Seminole Tribe and West Flager Associates resolved a lawsuit after a judge briefly blocked the 2021 compact agreement between the tribe and the state of Florida. The outcome resulted in Hard Rock Bet launching the World Jai-Alai League on its online platform.",2025-04-17T01:25:00.231+03:00,https://www.covers.com/industry/bill-banning-sweepstakes-progresses-in-florida-april-16-2025,Ziv Chen,positive

chevron-right,"BELMONT COUNTY, Ohio — Commissioners in Belmont County introduced Matt Abbott as the new President and CEO of Ohio Southeast Economic Development during their meeting Wednesday morning.
Abbott previously served as the Muskingum County Port Authority Director.
""We work with existing companies on expansion efforts. We work on attraction of new companies, we work on sites and site development to get sites ready for businesses to locate,"" Abbott said.
Abbot, who is no stranger to the area, toured the county to evaluate its assets and business climate.
Belmont County Port Authority Executive Director Larry Merry emphasized the collaborative efforts between Ohio Southeast Economic Development, Jobs Ohio, and local entities.
""They're one of our partners we work with,"" he said. ""We work with them initially and then they work with Jobs Ohio, and it's a combination of the three entities working with businesses to create jobs and investments.""
When asked about updates on the proposed cracker plant site at Dilles Bottom, Abbott noted the site's potential.
""I don't know there's any updates to that,"" he said. ""But that site possesses a lot of assets that we're talking about so it's a very marketable site when that time comes to be marketed. But I think there definitely still is hope that there will be an opportunity for PTT to make an investment and if not at the end of the day the community has one excellent asset.""
Abbott and his team are optimistic about the potential for economic development in Belmont County and are eager to work with local officials to enhance the area's growth.
911 CENTER EMPLOYEES RECOGNIZED
In recognition of National Public Safety Telecommunicator Week, the Belmont County Commissioners have honored the county's 911 center with a proclamation.
Bryan Minder, the 911 Director for Belmont County, highlighted the mental demands of the job.
""It's not a physically demanding job but it is a mentally demanding job,"" he said. ""You're constantly thinking of others, putting their safety in mind and trying to keep everybody's safety at the forefront.""",2025-04-17T00:07:00.000+03:00,https://wtov9.com/news/local/new-economic-leader-eyes-growth-potential-in-belmont-county-amid-site-tours,JESSE CAIN,positive
"APA, NCPA Cheer First-Of-Its-Kind State Law Banning PBMs from Owning Pharmacies | The Manila Times","Arkansas HB 1150 a model for other states, federal government, organizations say
Alexandria, Va., April 16, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- In a significant victory for patients and community pharmacies in Arkansas, Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders signed HB 1150 into law today. This is groundbreaking legislation that prohibits state permits to pharmacies owned by pharmacy benefit managers effective Jan. 1, 2026. The National Community Pharmacists Association, which represents the country's independent pharmacies, supported the Arkansas Pharmacists Association's leadership on HB 1150 as it moved through the legislative process.
APA is the voice of Arkansas pharmacists and has worked hard to advance HB 1150 and other PBM reform efforts. NCPA, which represents the country's independent community pharmacies, has also persistently advocated that state and federal policymakers rein in the conflicts of interest and anticompetitive business practices that arise with PBMs vertically integrated upstream with health insurers and downstream with pharmacies. These practices include contract terms that restrict competitors' access to patients, massive clawbacks, steering patients away from competing community pharmacies, below-cost reimbursements, and punitive audit practices. Prohibiting PBM ownership of pharmacies via HB 1150 would put an end to these tactics and promote Arkansans' access to quality pharmacy care.
""Today is a new day in Arkansas for our patients as the fox will no longer guard the henhouse,” said John Vinson, APA's chief executive officer. ""This bipartisan legislation passed overwhelmingly to protect public health and safety for Arkansans. HB 1150 will stop the abusive self-dealing at PBM affiliated pharmacies that raises prescription drug prices and limits patient access. The pharmacists of Arkansas are very grateful for a courageous legislature and Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders. We also thank Attorney General Tim Griffin for his support.”
""Time and time again, PBMs have proven themselves to be resistant to transparency and reform,” said Anne Cassity, NCPA's senior vice president of government affairs. ""HB 1150 is a structural change that gets to the heart of the problem - the conflicts of interest inherent in vertical integration that PBMs have been manipulating to the detriment of patients, taxpayers, and pharmacies. We applaud HB 1150 and are eager to see its provisions implemented in Arkansas and, ideally, throughout the country.""",2025-04-17T01:18:00.000+03:00,https://www.manilatimes.net/2025/04/17/tmt-newswire/globenewswire/apa-ncpa-cheer-first-of-its-kind-state-law-banning-pbms-from-owning-pharmacies/2093981,GlobeNewswire,positive

How Norway could succeed when a new crisis strikes,"THIS CONTENT IS BROUGHT TO YOU BY University of Oslo - read more
How Norway could succeed when a new crisis strikes
Norway is well prepared for a new pandemic, but dependent on one factor that money cannot buy, says a media professor.
One of the most fundamental cornerstones of democracy is trust, which played a crucial role in the Norwegian authoroties' management of the Covid-19 pandemic.
This is supported by research conducted by Øyvind Ihlen. He is a professor at the University of Oslo's Department of Media and Communication.
High trust in the authorities
“Trust in the authorities’ handling of the pandemic was high during the crisis, around 80-90 per cent. However, maintaining trust involves more than just providing information and instructions. People need to feel listened to, understood, and respected,” says Ihlen.
He has conducted extensive research on strategic and political communication.
In 2022, 77 per cent of Norwegians reported that they had trust in public authorities. Only the Swiss were more trusting than Norwegians, according to an OECD report.
Since then, Norwegians’ trust in the authorities has declined.
What worked during the pandemic, and what lessons can be carried into upcoming crises?
Five strategies to build trust
In a new book, Ihlen and his colleagues looked at how the authorities responded during the pandemic. They identified five trust-building strategies that were used.
“The first thing authorities need to do is to demonstrate competence and reliability. They can achieve this by showing that they have plans and strategies in place and are part of an international network,” says Ihlen.
At the very beginning of the pandemic, this was precisely where the authorities fell short.
Despite the overwhelming coverage of high infection rates in Italy, flights carrying potential cases from the country were still permitted to land.
At that time, public trust in the authorities reached a low point of under 50 per cent, according to data from the Norwegian Directorate of Health.
The effect of rallying together
When measures were implemented and a lockdown was eventually enacted, the trust barometer surged to over 90 per cent.
Never before had trust in the authorities been as high as during what was described as 'the most intrusive measures Norway has had in peacetime.'
“When the situation is at its worst and the authorities send a clear signal that this is serious, we see what researchers call the ‘rally around the flag’ effect. People put aside their disagreements and come together to support a common cause,” says Ihlen.
He explains that this ability to unite and refrain from criticism gradually diminishes. The event becomes politicised, leading to discussions such as: Didn't we overreact a bit? What's the right way forward now?
Important to listen to the people
A strong emphasis on media visibility and the use of social media is the second strategy for building trust.
This helped create a sense of community in facing the pandemic as an external threat.
“The authorities focused on what we call inviting rhetoric and expressed their desire for feedback from the public. Through this two-way communication, they demonstrated that they were listening to people’s concerns,” says Ihlen.
Much of his research is based on observation, primarily from the communications department at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, where researchers involved in the project spent periods of time.
He believes that allowing this is a good example of the third trust-building strategy: the authorities promoted transparency.
Open about uncertainty
When Ihlen and his fellow researchers compared how the authorities managed the pandemic in Norway, Sweden, and Denmark, they found that Norway stood out due to its transparency.
“The Norwegian authorities were candid about their uncertainties and indicated at one point that recommendations might change over time. They also acknowledged that experts could disagree among themselves, for instance, about whether a cabin ban was an effective measure,"" he says.
Ihlen explains that in both Sweden and Denmark they were more cautious about being open about disagreement and uncertainty in public.
This rhetorical strategy – being transparent about the complexities of the pandemic and acknowledging that much was uncertain – fostered a sense of honesty and integrity, signalling that people’s safety was being taken seriously.
But would such a strategy work equally well in other countries to gain public trust in the authorities? This is something Ihlen is currently looking into.
What you do matters
The authorities did not shy away from the seriousness of the pandemic while also appealing to a sense of collective responsibility.
Ihlen and his research colleagues identify this as the fourth trust-building strategy.
'Henny, 10, wants to continue meeting her friends at school. That’s why it’s especially important for you to keep your distance, wash your hands, and stay home when you’re sick,'
That was in a campaign from the Norwegian Directorate of Health in 2020. It featured a child’s drawing of someone washing their hands.
The campaign about Henny is also an example that highlights the last of the five strategies employed during the pandemic:
During crises, it is essential that people are given very concrete information about what to do.
“We needed a toolbox of actions we could take, such as the encouragement to wash hands. Surveys show that there was a high level of acceptance for these types of instructions,” Ihlen notes.
According to measurements from the Norwegian Directorate of Health, over 90 per cent responded ‘to a large extent’ when asked whether they followed the recommendations from health authorities – except toward the end of the pandemic.
An important task for the authorities during crises is also to understand the challenges that make it difficult for the public to follow recommendations and rules.
This requires dialogue and the ability to adapt communication in line with a constantly evolving situation, as seen during a pandemic.
Trust must be foundational
But could these five strategies for achieving trust be applied to other crises, such as the climate crisis or in a wartime situation?
“Being open, providing clear information about what people should do, and engaging in two-way communication are important rhetorical strategies that will work in most crises. However, the contexts are entirely different,” says Ihlen.
He illustrates this with some examples:
Norway, for instance, has a high number of climate sceptics. This must be seen in the context of how important oil is to the Norwegian economy. The climate crisis is also perceived as less urgent compared to the immediacy a wartime situation might present. In a wartime situation, dialogue and relationship-building may take a backseat to decisive action and instructions.
“But again, we need trust across all these situations,” Ihlen points out.
He highlights how crucial it is that people have faith in the authorities’ competence, that they do not conceal important information, and that, at their core, they have the public’s best interests at heart.
“The critical challenge now relates to political polarisation and the politicisation of research. We are seeing an increasing tendency for many to dismiss research they do not agree with, or that does not align with their worldview. This poses a challenge not only for trust in research and institutions but for society and democracy as a whole,” says Ihlen.

Junta Escolar de Miami-Dade explora posibilidad de reducir impuestos de la propiedad para adultos mayores,"De manera unánime la Junta Escolar de Miami-Dade aprobó una iniciativa que busca reducir los impuestos a la propiedad para las personas mayores.
Roberto J. Alonso, miembro de la Junta Escolar e impulsor de la propuesta, dice que “hoy lo que estamos proponiendo es explorar la habilidad del distrito de darle un descuento a nuestros séniors en la comunidad para poder buscarle manera que se puedan quedar en sus casas, estamos viviendo muchos de nuestros residentes que dicen que el costo ha subido mucho”.
Sin duda una realidad que ha golpeado a las personas más vulnerables de nuestra comunidad, por eso esta iniciativa -según Alonso- pretende explorar de qué manera se les puede proporcionar algún tipo de alivio del impuesto a la propiedad a personas mayores, que tienen ingresos fijos.
“Ciertamente el distrito no tiene la habilidad de ofrecerle un descuento a nuestros residentes, pero le estamos pidiendo a la legislatura que nos de la habilidad de explorar y darle un descuento a ellos”, advierte Alonso.
Steve Gallon, otro miembro de la Junta Escolar, apunta: “creo que cualquier momento en el que intentamos explorar dar cierto alivio a nuestros residentes sobre los taxes a la propiedad es un buen ejercicio, aunque aún hay mucho que investigar sobre los datos, es una gran idea. Pero aún necesitamos saber el impacto directo en nuestra comunidad, debemos tener más información”.
Tras esta aprobación la Junta Escolar buscará formas adicionales de ofrecer algún alivio fiscal a las personas mayores. “Lo que estamos proponiendo hoy es la habilidad de explorar si podemos darle créditos adicionales a nuestra comunidad”.
A partir de ahora la Junta Escolar de Miami-Dade va a investigar la viabilidad y de qué manera se podrá influenciar a la legislatura estatal para que apruebe algún tipo de alivio a los adultos mayores.",2025-04-17T00:10:00.000+03:00,https://www.telemundo51.com/noticias/local/junta-escolar-de-miami-dade-explora-posibilidad-de-reducir-impuestos-de-la-propiedad-para-adultos-mayores/2649306,Leana Astorga,positive
Condado de Los Ángeles aprueba medidas más duras contra ocupación de vías,"Con tres votos a favor y ninguno en contra, la Junta de Supervisores del Condado de Los Ángeles aprobó este martes una moción para endurecer las sanciones civiles a personas relacionadas con la participación en tomas de control de calle ilegales .
Funcionarios del condado dijeron que la propuesta tiene el propósito de detener las tomas de control de calles antes de que ocurran , debido a que se convirtió en un problema cada vez más frecuente y que, en algunos casos, tuvo incidentes mortales en Los Ángeles y en otros condados cercanos.
La noche de este domingo ocurrió una concentración con más de 150 vehículos en un centro comercial de Santa Ana, en el Condado de Orange, que fue calificada por las autoridades como una “toma de posesión por conducción imprudente” .

La supervisora Holly Mitchell dijo a la cadena KTLA que este tipo de incidentes ocurren prácticamente cada semana , en especial en algunos vecindarios no incorporados del Condado de Los Ángeles.
Mitchell dijo que es frecuente que personas mayores y familias jóvenes le digan que cada fin de semana, sobre todo durante las noches de viernes y sábados , se escucha el sonido de los motores de vehículos que participan en las tomas de control de calle, cada vez más cerca de sus casas.
La supervisora Mitchell encabezó la iniciativa para duplicar las multas por delitos menores de $1,000 dólares para quienes organicen, promuevan y asistan a concentraciones de tomas de control de calles ilegales.

En la moción, se prohíben las ocupaciones fuera de las vías públicas , lo que incluye las zonas de estacionamiento.
La propuesta también considera castigo a los promotores de las reuniones ilegales, lo que incluye a quienes publiciten las tomas de control de calle en redes sociales y que consiguen una gran cantidad de seguidores mientras transmiten las reuniones en vivo con un cobro económico .
Con la iniciativa, se facilitaría la eliminación de publicaciones y la desmonetización de perfiles que promuevan actividades ilegales en las plataformas de redes sociales.

“Sé que no hay una única solución, pero realmente espero que al aumentar el pago por participar, junto con nuestras iniciativas de educación pública, la gente comprenda el verdadero peligro que están causando a sus propias familias, amigos, vecinos y comunidades “, añadió Mitchell.
En algunas ocasiones, comercios cercanos a los lugares donde ocurren las tomas de control de calle han sido saqueados por las decenas de personas que se reúnen para presenciar las acrobacias que hacen los conductores.
De acuerdo con las estadísticas de SAFE (Las calles son para todos), durante el último trimestre de 2024 se registró un incremento del 64% por incidentes relacionados con tomas de control de call e, e incluso en algunos vecindarios ocurrieron varios casos en la misma noche.

El director de Defensa del Condado de Los Ángeles en SAFE, Brett Slaughenhaupt, otro aspecto de la crisis de salud pública es que no solo afecta a los miembros de la comunidad, sino también a quienes asisten, porque las muertes ocurren cuando los conductores pierden el control de los autos .
“Esto no puede seguir sucediendo. No podemos seguir viendo estas muertes, estas lesiones , estas personas que sigan causando estragos”, dijo.
La votación de este martes en la Junta de Supervisores representa un paso más para imponer sanciones más severas a quienes participen en tomas de control de calle. Necesita una nueva votación para adoptarlas tan pronto estén redactadas .",2025-04-17T01:08:00.000+03:00,https://laopinion.com/2025/04/16/condado-de-los-angeles-aprueba-medidas-mas-duras-contra-ocupacion-de-vias,Ricardo Roura,positive

XRP's Bullish Momentum Hinges on $2.25 Weekly Close,"XRP's Bullish Momentum Hinges on $2.25 Weekly Close
XRP has recently regained momentum, trading above $2.00, and analysts are closely watching its performance for signs of a bullish trend. Crypto analyst EGRAG CRYPTO has highlighted that this week could be pivotal for XRP, as its closing price will determine the direction of its momentum. According to EGRAG's analysis, the current weekly candle for XRP is hovering just above $2.10 and the 21-week Exponential Moving Average (EMA). The key indicator for a bullish continuation is whether XRP can close the week above $2.25 with a full-bodied candle.
The $2.25 level is crucial for XRP's price recovery, as it represents the final resistance before validating the recovery structure that has been forming since the sharp retracement in March and April. EGRAG's weekly chart shows XRP stabilizing above the 21-week EMA, which adds credibility to the potential for a bullish continuation. A weekly close above $2.25 would mark the first full-bodied weekly candle above the 21W EMA in the past four weeks, confirming that bulls have regained dominance and that a bottom was established on April 7.
If XRP successfully closes above $2.25, it suggests that the April 7 bottom will continue to hold as support. The chart outlines close price targets at $2.51 and $2.60, with Fibonacci extension levels projecting even higher zones at $2.69 on the way to crossing back above $3. However, if XRP fails to close above $2.25, it could reintroduce bearish narratives, including potential market disruptions due to recent tariff issues between the US and China. A strong rejection could see the XRP price pull back toward the $1.96 Fibonacci level or even lower into the broader support band of around $1.58 to $1.30, making the white box region on the chart the primary battleground for bulls and bears.",2025-04-17T00:19:09.634+03:00,https://www.ainvest.com/news/xrp-bullish-momentum-hinges-2-25-weekly-close-2504,Coin World,positive

Il «bilaterale» di Meloni è un viaggio della speranza

MISSIONE A WASHINGTON AD ALTO RISCHIO L’incontro oggi alle 12 (le 18 in Italia). Su Cina e Nato il pressing del presidente
Edizione del 17 aprile 2025Edizione 17.04.2025
Atteso con un mix di speranza e timore, circondato da aspettative forse superiori a quel che la stessa Meloni si augurasse, il momento della verità è arrivato. La premier è giunta ieri sera a Washington senza ancora sapere nei particolari come si svolgerà l’incontro di oggi con Donald Trump. Orario previsto le 12, le 18 in Italia, per un colloquio che dovrebbe prolungarsi per un’ora. Non si sa però se ci saranno giornalisti, come nell’infausto summit con Zelensky. La delegazione italiana è nota: il consigliere diplomatico Fabrizio Saggio, quello militare Franco Federici, l’ambasciatrice Mariangela Zappìa. Chi affiancherà Trump invece è ancora ignoto. Non il segretario di Stato Marco Rubio, in viaggio all’estero, e chissà se sarà presente il vicepresidente JD Vance. Con lui, comunque, il faccia a faccia è già fissato: 24 ore dopo a Roma. L’hillbilly, convertito al cattolicesimo sperava di essere ricevuto poi dal papa. Dovrà invece accontentarsi del segretario di Stato Parolin.
Alla vigilia ministri e politici della destra ripetono un concetto solo: la missione è difficile ma Meloni ce la può fare. Dita incrociate e più strette di tutti le tiene il presidente degli industriali Orsini. La stessa premier, subito prima di imbarcarsi, parla di «fase tanto complessa quanto in rapida evoluzione», nella quale occorre «ragionare con lucidità, lavorare con concretezza e pragmatismo». Giusto per far sapere che è consapevole del percorso insidioso che ha di fronte.
Il sogno di derubricare in extremis l’escursione, declassandola a semplice «incontro bilaterale», è sfumato nel giro di poche ore. Certo, nello studio ovale sarà affrontato anche questo aspetto ma la delicatezza del momento e le aspettative concentrate sul viaggio della premier europea più omogenea al presidente americano erano troppe per consentire ridimensionamenti. Del resto Meloni e von der Leyen si sono sentite al telefono sino alla fine, con ultimo colloquio mercoledì sera e la copertura che la Commissione offre all’amica italiana è piena. Impossibile far finta che il piatto forte, anche se non l’unico, non siano i dazi. La realtà è che Meloni si presenta in doppia veste: capo del governo italiano ma anche ambasciatrice Ue e starà attenta a evitare ogni pur minima contraddizione fra le due parti in commedia.
Meloni però stavolta rischia forte e lo sa. Se tornerà a mani vuote, dimostrazione concreta di quanto poco ascolto raccolga alla corte di re Donald, il ruolo centrale a cui mira in Europa si allontanerà di parecchi anni luce. Ma un successo pieno sembra impossibile. Gli americani hanno già bocciato la soluzione che lei stessa si accingeva a proporre, l’abbattimento reciproco di ogni dazio. Hanno già detto no al commissario al Commercio europeo Sefcovic e anche se con Trump non si può mai dire è quasi fuori discussione che concedano di più all’italiana. Però se la premier riuscisse a strappare l’impegno a incontrare Ursula von der Leyen, magari in vista di un possibile vertice Usa-Ue, il risultato sarebbe indiscutibile. Trump infatti sinora ha sempre sdegnato la presidente della Commissione in segno di sprezzante non riconoscimento della Ue.
Uno degli argomenti forti di Meloni sarà la necessità di indicare all’Europa una strada alternativa al dialogo con la Cina. L’Italia, per ora, è attestata sulle posizioni di Trump: frena cioè su allargamento e approfondimento dei rapporti commerciali con Pechino. Ma l’ospite farà presente al padrone di casa che per portare su quella linea l’intera Unione è necessario che arrivino segnali di pace nella guerra dei dazi interna all’occidente. L’americano, per ora, si limita a promettere di allentare la morsa dei dazi per i Paesi che evitano cooperazioni con il Dragone ed è troppo poco.
Il passaggio più delicato sarà probabilmente la richiesta rivolta alla leader italiana di aumentare il contributo per le spese Nato, portandolo se non al 5% del Pil almeno al 3,5%. È una condizione che l’Italia non può accettare, se non sotto forma di vaghi impegni. Meloni prometterà in compenso di arrivare al sospirato 2% prestissimo. Ma se non dovesse bastare sul vertice cadrebbe il gelo, ed è l’eventualità più temuta a Roma. Sarebbe un insuccesso pieno su tutti i fronti e il peso specifico del governo italiano in Europa precipiterebbe ai minimi storici.

Albany lawmakers near deal on discovery law - Newsday,"Gov. Hochul: NYS lawmakers 'on verge' of a deal on key issue holding up state budget
ALBANY — Gov. Kathy Hochul said Wednesday that lawmakers were ""on the verge"" of reaching a deal on ""discovery,"" the sharing of evidence in criminal trials that has been holding up a larger agreement on a state budget.
""I believe we’re on the verge of a very important deal,"" Hochul told reporters. Using a football analogy, she said lawmakers were ""on the 5-yard line"" but not in the end zone yet.
Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie (D-Bronx) — who took a lead role in negotiating directly with New York City’s five district attorneys — said: ""I think it’s actually on the 1-inch line"" with just minor legal language details to finalize.
Clearing up the issue would have a domino effect on settling other outstanding ones — a cellphone ban in schools, financial aid to school districts, for example — and setting course for the State Legislature to vote on budget deal this month.
Lawmakers were supposed to approve a budget by April 1, the beginning of New York’s fiscal year. Hochul held out, as she has done in previous years, to get some largely non-budgetary policy issues, such as discovery, in the budget agreement.
In January, Hochul proposed a $252 billion state budget, including a 4.7% increase in school aid, a middle-class tax cut and tax rebate check of as much as $500 to families. The final agreement is expected to spend more overall and include a more generous hike in school aid.
Hochul, who has been pressured by the political right on crime and criminal justice issues, made ""discovery"" changes a priority.
New York overhauled its discovery law in 2019, making prosecutors share evidence sooner and, practically speaking, tying their discovery obligations to speedy trial guarantees — a trial within 90 days for most misdemeanors and six months for many felonies. Previously, prosecutors could wait till the eve of a trial to share evidence.
Prosecutors complained the new law resulted too many dismissals — driven largely by New York City, which accounts for more than 92% of case dismissals statewide.
In simple terms, the compromise will give judges more express discretion to weigh whether failure to turn over a piece of evidence actually causes harm to a person’s defense — something prosecutors wanted. But it rejects prosecutors’ call for decoupling discovery rules and speedy trial guarantees, Heastie told Newsday.
Rank-and-file Democratic legislators didn’t want to give all the leverage back to prosecutors, Heastie and numerous other legislators had said over the weeks of negotiations.
Heastie told Newsday: ""I think we all landed in a pretty good place.""
Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez, at the news conference with Hochul, said: ""Judges are going to have individual ability to look at a case"" to determine if the failure to share a piece of evidence is harmful or just tangential to a case.
Hochul said final ""edits"" are being hashed out — but nothing is final until that is accomplished.
""I think we're very, very close to being done, and perhaps today will be the day we say"" so, Hochul said.

Trump administration orders halt to work on wind project off coast of Long Beach - Newsday,"Trump administration orders immediate stop to work on wind project near the coast of Long Beach
Interior Secretary Doug Burgum ordered an immediate halt Wednesday to work on a planned offshore wind project near the coast of Long Beach, arguing that the Biden administration rushed the approval process.
A memo by Burgum directed Interior's Bureau of Ocean Energy Management to direct Norwegian energy developer Equinor to ""cease all construction activities on the Empire Wind project"" until a review is completed to address ""serious deficiencies.""
The company plans to erect 54 1,000-foot wind turbines, starting around 15 miles from the shore. The turbines are scheduled to be pile-driven into the seabed in coming months after Equinor obtained the necessary federal and state approvals.
The Biden administration approved the project in November 2023.
""Approval for the project was rushed through by the prior administration without sufficient analysis or consultation among the relevant agencies as relates to the potential effects from the project,"" Burgum wrote in the memo.
Last month, President Donald Trump issued an executive order preventing agencies from issuing new or renewed wind energy leases for federal waterways, citing ""various legal deficiencies,"" the potential ""grave harm"" to shipping and fishing interests and the impact on marine mammals and birds.
Gov. Kathy Hochul issued a statement Wednesday criticizing the work stoppage.
""This fully federally permitted project has already put shovels in the ground before the president’s executive orders,"" Hochul wrote. ""It’s exactly the type of bipartisan energy solution we should be working on. As governor, I will not allow this federal overreach to stand.""
Burgum's memo came hours after Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman called on the Environmental Protection Agency and the Justice Department to launch investigations into whether Equinor used shortcuts to obtain permits and approvals for Empire Wind.
At a news conference in Long Beach with dozens of GOP lawmakers, first responders and community advocates, Blakeman argued that he approval process was unfair, hurried and done in a ""slipshod way.""
The EPA said it is unaware of any agency investigation into the project, and the Justice Department did not respond to requests for comment.
""How did they obtain those permits?,"" Blakeman said of Equinor. ""Did they go through the proper procedures? Were all the boxes checked? Were the environmental studies done? Is this a problem for navigation? Is this a problem for commercial fishing? Is this a national security issue? Is the Defense Department concerned about these offshore wind turbines that may mask an attack from air or an attack by a submarine? There's a lot of issues out there that haven't been answered ... We are hopeful that the EPA will now be looking at the process where we think there were shortcuts and false information.""
Empire Wind spokesman David Schoetz did not respond to requests for comment Wednesday but previously told Newsday the company has ""received all necessary federal permits for offshore construction and will continue to comply with the requirements of these permits.""
The project has already begun work at South Brooklyn Marine Terminal, including for a new operations and maintenance facility and components for a transformer. The project will rely on an undersea cable from a planned wind-array 15 miles from Long Beach, where some residents remain staunchly opposed to it.
Equinor originally planned to put its 54 wind turbines on giant concrete foundations, which were to be built near the Port of Albany, shipped down the Hudson River and lowered from boats onto the ocean floor.
But the company decided to use less expensive monopile foundations, which are pounded 197 feet into the seafloor using a massive hammer-type system mounted on a barge. Driving each monopile into the seafloor can take approximately 5,000-7,000 blows, according to an Equinor analysis, an action critics fear could have an environmental impact on marine mammals and other species.
""It's terrible, and it needs to stop now,"" Christina Kramer of Protect Our Coast Long Island NY, an environmental conservation group that has filed numerous objections to the project, said of the project during the news conference.
The New York League of Conservation Voters, which supports Empire Wind, responded in a statement that ""the Trump administration is jeopardizing thousands of union jobs, dealing a blow to clean energy, and siding with fossil fuel interests over the health and safety of New Yorkers ... Halting a fully permitted, shovel-ready project of this scale is unconscionable, especially at a time when we urgently need more clean, reliable energy to drive economic development and meet growing demand.
Local officials also railed Wednesday against two proposed lithium-ion battery energy storage sites in Oyster Bay: Jupiter Power's 275-megawatt project in Glenwood Landing and Calpine Corporation's planned battery site on an industrial plot adjacent to its natural gas and steam plant in Hicksville.
The town this month approved a six-month extension of its existing battery energy storage moratorium that was first implemented in April 2024, stalling progress on either proposal.
Town spokeswoman Marta Kane said Oyster Bay provided preliminary feedback on the 2022 Jupiter Power project but that it hasn't been resubmitted. The town previously denied Calpine's request to be exempt from the moratorium.
Residents have criticized Jupiter Power's $250 million project, arguing it could leave toxic remnants behind if a fire occurred. Company officials insist the project is safe, citing strict new fire safety codes.
Nassau Chief Fire Marshal Michael Uttaro Wednesday said he supports ""hitting the pause button on [the projects] until there's better research done, better codes to handle it, and without a doubt, better training for our firefighters.""
Garret Gray, a lawyer representing Calpine, contends the company uses different technology than the batteries used at an East Hampton storage site that went on fire in May 2023.

The New York League of Conservation Voters, which supports Empire Wind, responded in a statement that ""the Trump administration is jeopardizing thousands of union jobs, dealing a blow to clean energy, and siding with fossil fuel interests over the health and safety of New Yorkers ... Halting a fully permitted, shovel-ready project of this scale is unconscionable, especially at a time when we urgently need more clean, reliable energy to drive economic development and meet growing demand.
Battery storage concerns
Local officials also railed Wednesday against two proposed lithium-ion battery energy storage sites in Oyster Bay: Jupiter Power's 275-megawatt project in Glenwood Landing and Calpine Corporation's planned battery site on an industrial plot adjacent to its natural gas and steam plant in Hicksville.
The town this month approved a six-month extension of its existing battery energy storage moratorium that was first implemented in April 2024, stalling progress on either proposal.
Town spokeswoman Marta Kane said Oyster Bay provided preliminary feedback on the 2022 Jupiter Power project but that it hasn't been resubmitted. The town previously denied Calpine's request to be exempt from the moratorium.
Residents have criticized Jupiter Power's $250 million project, arguing it could leave toxic remnants behind if a fire occurred. Company officials insist the project is safe, citing strict new fire safety codes.
Nassau Chief Fire Marshal Michael Uttaro Wednesday said he supports ""hitting the pause button on [the projects] until there's better research done, better codes to handle it, and without a doubt, better training for our firefighters.""
Garret Gray, a lawyer representing Calpine, contends the company uses different technology than the batteries used at an East Hampton storage site that went on fire in May 2023.

Lei reconhece Nossa Senhora do Rocio como padroeira do Paraná,"Nesta terça-feira (16), foi sancionada na Assembleia Legislativa do Paraná (Alep) a lei que reconhece Nossa Senhora do Rocio como padroeira do Estado do Paraná . Com a nova legislação, o calendário do estado passa a incluir oficialmente o Dia da Padroeira do Paraná, celebrado em 15 de novembro.
Além do aspecto religioso, o reconhecimento da padroeira representa um marco civil e histórico para os paranaenses. “Há décadas a devoção a Nossa Senhora do Rocio é celebrada com intensidade, especialmente em Paranaguá, cidade sede do Santuário Estadual dedicado à Santa. Agora, essa fé passa a ter reconhecimento oficial e legal no âmbito do Estado”, afirmou o deputado Anibelli Neto, autor do projeto que deu origem à Lei nº 22.360/2025.
A proposta do deputado também busca reconhecer a Procissão Solene em homenagem à padroeira, realizada em Paranaguá, como Patrimônio Cultural e Imaterial do Paraná. A procissão integra a Festa de Nossa Senhora do Rocio, considerada a maior manifestação religiosa da região Sul do Brasil. Com o tema “Com a Mãe do Rocio aos Pés da Cruz”, a organização realizará a 212ª edição da festa entre os dias 6 e 15 de novembro deste ano.
Relação de Nossa Senhora do Rocio com o Paraná Do latim, Rocio significa “orvalho”, que simbolicamente representa as bênçãos e graças recebidas das mãos de Nossa Senhora do Rocio. O culto à Santa no Paraná tem origem no século XVII, com registros datados de 1648. Em 1977, o Paraná tornou-se o primeiro estado brasileiro a ter uma padroeira oficialmente reconhecida pelo Vaticano, por meio do Papa Paulo VI.

California takes emergency action to protect coastal railroad corridor in Orange County | News | actionnewsnow.com,"SACRAMENTO, Calif. - The California Transportation Commission has allocated $9.98 million in emergency funds to enhance the resiliency of the LOSSAN rail corridor in Orange County.
This move aims to prevent disruptions caused by climate-related issues like slope erosion and landslides.
According to the Commission, these improvements will protect a seven-mile segment of the rail line, which is crucial for over 150 daily passenger trains and more than $1 billion in freight annually.
""The LOSSAN rail corridor is an integral part of California’s transportation system,"" said Commission Chair Darnell Grisby.
California Transportation Secretary Toks Omishakin highlighted the importance of this investment, emphasizing its role in ensuring a reliable rail system that benefits millions of Californians.
""Today’s critical investment, which was only made possible through the close cooperation among our many partners, underscores our shared urgency in ensuring a reliable and resilient rail system that improves the lives of Californians,"" said Omishakin.
The emergency funds will be used for initial work, including repairing rip-rap to protect against coastal erosion and removing the damaged Mariposa pedestrian bridge.
Caltrans Director Tony Tavares expressed commitment to enhancing rail travel convenience and sustainability for Californians through these improvements.
""Decisive action taken today at the California Transportation Commission helps power our effort to secure ease of movement through this vital transportation corridor,"" said Tavares.
The funding is part of a larger $205 million that was awarded to the Coastal Rail Infrastructure Resiliency Project by the Commission and CalSTA in October 2024.

Court clears way for pardon of Petaluma war hero,"Penry Park in Petaluma is named for Medal of Honor recipient Sgt. Richard Penry, who received a posthumous pardon for a drug conviction Wednesday. Google Maps The state Supreme Court granted Gov. Gavin Newsom’s request on Wednesday for a posthumous pardon for Army Sgt. Richard Penry of Petaluma, who was awarded the presidential Medal of Honor in 1971 for rescuing 23 fellow soldiers in Vietnam, then was convicted of drug crimes while suffering severe emotional distress after his discharge.
Penry died of cancer in 1994, at age 45, and the city of Petaluma has since named two sites in his honor, Penry Park and the Sgt. Richard Penry Medal of Honor Memorial Military Museum.
The nation properly honored Penry “for his extraordinary service and heroism at the risk of his own life,” Eliza Hersh, Newsom’s deputy legal affairs secretary, said in the governor’s clemency application to the court.

“Justice has been done for Sgt. Richard Penry, his family, and so many of our veterans who suffer in silence in their service to our Country,” Petaluma City Manager Peggy Flynn said Wednesday.
Penry joined the Army in March 1969 and was stationed in Vietnam’s Binh Tuy Province in January 1970 when his unit came under mortar and rocket fire. According to an Army report released by President Richard Nixon in his Medal of Honor declaration in January 1971, Penry provided first aid to the wounded company commander and others, turned back an assault by 30 soldiers, then crawled through heavy fire to reach additional wounded combatants.
He led five men to safety, and after evacuation helicopters arrived, went back and carried 18 wounded soldiers to the evacuation site, the report said.
“Sergeant Penry’s extraordinary heroism at the risk of his own life (was) in keeping with the highest traditions of the military service and reflect great credit on him, his unit, and the United States Army,” said the report released by Nixon.
When other troops arrived at the scene, Penry “was just sitting on a log by himself, just smoking a cigar, shaking,” a fellow soldier, former Army Maj. Andrew LeMarquand, told CBS News.

It may have been the first sign of post-traumatic stress disorder Penry suffered after his discharge in March 1971. He was convicted in 1973 of selling cocaine to an undercover police officer and was arrested twice more on suspicion of other drug offenses but was freed on probation until 1976, when he was sentenced to seven months in jail in 1976 for violating the terms of his probation.
LeMarquand and other veterans have campaigned to clear Penry’s name, seeking pardons from Newsom and from then-President Joe Biden for a separate federal drug conviction. No response to that request has been reported yet from the White House.
The state Supreme Court granted Newsom’s request in a brief order Wednesday with no indication of dissents from any of the seven justices.
The case is Penry on Clemency, No. S289024.

Harvard made only response it could to Trump demands: No,"By M. Gessen / The New York Times The world’s most famous university has done the right thing, and this is major news. It shouldn’t be. But less than three months into the second Trump administration, we are surprised by simple dignity. Capitulation would have garnered smaller headlines. On Friday, the Trump administration sent a five-page letter to Harvard accusing the university of failing “to live up to both the intellectual and civil rights conditions that justify federal investment.” The letter demanded that the university change its governance structure; overhaul its admissions policies; submit to an external audit of the medical school, the School of Public Health, the Divinity School and several other programs that the letter claimed have “egregious records of antisemitism or other bias”; revamp student-discipline procedures; “end support” and withdraw university recognition of several pro-Palestinian student groups and the National Lawyers Guild; and commit to a process of reform running “at least until the end of 2028,” during which the university would submit quarterly reports on its compliance with the government’s demands. In the manner of a racketeer, the letter implied, without quite spelling it out, that if the university failed to comply, it would lose its federal funding. -snip- But the Trump administration pulls funds first and negotiates second, dispensing with the rest of the process. Its first target was Columbia University. When that school acceded to the administration’s demands, it didn’t get its funding back. Instead, the administration is reportedly considering demanding that Columbia agree to direct government oversight; effectively, a takeover of the university. Harvard chose a different response from Columbia’s. On Monday, its lawyers sent a letter to the administration pointing out that the administration was in violation of the law. “The university will not surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights,” the letter said. “Neither Harvard nor any other private university can allow itself to be taken over by the federal government. Accordingly, Harvard will not accept the government’s terms.” https://www.heraldnet.com/opinion/gssen-harvard-made-only-response-it-could-to-trump-demands-no/",2025-04-17T01:12:00.000+03:00,https://democraticunderground.com/1016402452,Yo Mama Been Loggin,positive
Buscan declarar 104 predios de Bucaramanga como de utilidad pública para construir nueva vía,"La Alcaldía de Bucaramanga busca construir la vía que busca acabar con los ‘trancones’ de la calle 56 y darle una nueva alternativa de movilidad a la Ciudadela Real de Minas.
Por cerca de 15 años la obra del Par Vial de la 54 y 55 ha estado en pausa. Sin embargo, el proyecto fue radicado nuevamente ante el Concejo de Bucaramanga.
De acuerdo con el jefe de la Oficina de Valorización de Bucaramanga, Jairo Jaimes Yañez, “en 2023 la UIS actualizó los estudios de esta obra de acuerdo con las necesidades de movilidad de la zona”. Lea también: Denuncian falta de apoyo del Gobierno Nacional para superar crisis de Metrolínea
Jaimes Yañez agregó que, según el estudio, se deben declarar 104 predios como de utilidad pública para construir el Par Vial. Para que esto sea posible, el Concejo deberá aprobar que dichos predios tengan la mencionada declaratoria.
Actualmente, se designaron dos concejales ponentes y el proyecto se encuentra en estudio. Se espera que durante la última semana de abril se debata la propuesta en comisión y en plenaria del cabildo.
De aprobarse la iniciativa, el paso siguiente es la inscripción de los 104 predios, como de utilidad pública, ante el catastro e iniciar el proceso de gestión predial. Le puede interesar: Futuro de Metrolínea en manos de un juez: ¿será finalmente liquidada?

Sin embargo, este cobro se viene realizando a morosos, concepto que, a la fecha, está en cerca de $22.000 millones.
Al respecto, el jefe de la Oficina de Valorización de Bucaramanga, Jairo Jaimes Yañez, la obra está planteada en dos fases, “una de la 15 hacia arriba y otra de la 15 hacia bajo.

GSK (GSK) Receives Expanded Recommendation for AREXVY RSV Vaccine | GSK Stock News,"GSK (GSK, Financial) has announced a positive decision from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), which has extended its recommendation for the use of RSV vaccines to include GSK’s AREXVY. This update encompasses adults aged 50 to 59 who have a heightened risk of severe RSV disease. This demographic includes individuals with underlying health conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, diabetes, and heart disease, as well as those residing in care facilities.
The ACIP's recent vote expands upon their earlier recommendation from June 2024, which approved RSV vaccines for adults aged 60 to 74 at increased risk, along with all individuals aged 75 and over. AREXVY is designed to prevent lower respiratory tract disease (LRTD) associated with RSV, now recommended for both the 60-plus age group and at-risk adults aged 50 through 59.
Research indicates that RSV is responsible for approximately 42,000 hospitalizations annually among U.S. adults aged 50 to 64. Those with pre-existing medical conditions, such as COPD, asthma, heart failure, and diabetes, face a higher risk of severe outcomes from RSV infections. The virus can worsen these conditions, potentially leading to severe complications like pneumonia, hospitalization, or even death.

Here's what finance reports reveal about Virginia's busy election year,"RICHMOND — Democrats are off to a head start in fundraising for Virginia’s busy campaign season, with former Rep. Abigail Spanberger (D) reporting a big cash lead over Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears (R) in the race for governor and Democrats outraising Republicans overall in contests for 100 seats in the House of Delegates, according to campaign finance reports filed this week.
Spanberger reported raising $6.7 million during the first three months of the year as of a midnight Tuesday state filing deadline — more than double the $3.1 million raised by Earle-Sears, according to an analysis by the Virginia Public Access Project.
Earle-Sears’s fundraising was restricted at the start of the year because she was not allowed to raise money during the General Assembly session, which ran from Jan. 8 through Feb. 22, as she presided over the state Senate in her role as lieutenant governor. The Republican ended the quarter with a little over $4 million in cash on hand, while Spanberger finished the period with just over $11 million in the bank.
The already astronomical totals reflect the outsize attention aimed at the Virginia gubernatorial race, which is always a barometer for political sentiment following a presidential election but carries extra freight this year. Democrats are hoping to make a strong stand against the Trump administration while Republicans look to extend their brand in a purple state, all with a historic contest that virtually ensures Virginia will have its first female governor. If Earle-Sears were to win, she would be the first African American woman to lead any state.
Here are highlights from the campaign-finance filings:
Big-money donors
Out-of-state billionaires opened their wallets for both gubernatorial candidates along with homegrown, high-dollar donors such as unions and coal barons.
Spanberger’s two largest contributors were VoteVets Federal PAC ($500,000) and the American Federation of State County and Municipal Employees Working Families Fund ($250,000).
A handful of California billionaires donated $100,000 to her campaign, including Gwendolyn Sontheim Meyer, heiress of Cargill, one of the world’s largest commodities traders, and LinkedIn co-founder and investor Reid Hoffman. Elizabeth Simons, daughter of hedge fund billionaire James Simons and chairwoman of the Heising-Simons Foundation, also gave $100,000. So did her husband, hedge fund manager Mark Heising.
Earle-Sears’s largest donor was Thomas Peterffy, a national GOP megadonor and Florida resident who donated $3 million to Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s Spirit of Virginia PAC in 2023 as he publicly called on Youngkin (R) to enter the 2024 presidential race. Peterffy gave $300,000 to Earle-Sears — and $1 million to Youngkin’s PAC, bringing his total contributions to Spirit of Virginia to $4 million.
Peterffy, the world’s 27th-richest person, according to Forbes, which put his net worth at $57.3 billion in March, declined to comment through a spokeswoman.
Other major donors to Earle-Sears include billionaire Earl Gentry Kendrick Jr., founder of Datatel and managing general partner of the Arizona Diamondbacks baseball team, who gave $150,000. Richard Baxter Gilliam, a southwest Virginia coal magnate who has donated about $7 million to Virginia Republicans over the past two decades, gave her $100,000. Former California congressman and U.S. House speaker Kevin McCarthy (R) donated $50,000.
National prospects
Youngkin’s PAC raised $1.9 million and ended the quarter with about $1.6 million in the bank. The term-limited governor could tap the PAC to help Republicans in Virginia this year or transfer the money to a PAC supporting his potential 2028 presidential bid, which he has been mulling since taking a pass on the 2024 race. Republicans’ performance in the fall could be critical to Youngkin’s national prospects.
Aside from Peterffy, the PAC’s biggest donors were: Tiger Lily Capital, a Charlottesville financial services outfit, which donated $150,000; Arkansas poultry magnate Ronald Cameron, who gave $100,000; and Rooney Holdings, an international investment company based in Florida, which also gave $100,000.
Down ballot
In the Republican race for lieutenant governor, Pat Herrity, a member of the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors, raised $540,273 and headed into April with $335,067 in the bank. His lone rival for the nomination, Richmond talk-radio host John Reid, raised $178,110 and ended the quarter with $90,990 on hand.
In the six-way Democratic primary, former Richmond mayor Levar Stoney raised the most: $428,802, leaving him with $522,501 in the bank at the end of March. Babur B. Lateef, chairman of the Prince William County School Board, raised $398,269 and had $381,392 on hand.
Two of their rivals are state legislators who were barred from fundraising during the 46-day General Assembly session: state Sen. Aaron R. Rouse (Virginia Beach), who raised $399,319 and ended the period with $925,949 in cash; and state Sen. Ghazala F. Hashmi (Richmond), who raised $305,871 and had $655,869 in the bank. Union leader and attorney Alex J. Bastani raised $134,137 and headed into April with $33,046. No new report was available for former federal prosecutor Victor Salgado, who had $78,336 in the bank at the end of December.
In the race for attorney general, incumbent Jason S. Miyares (R), who is unchallenged for the GOP nomination, raised $1.5 million and had $2.1 million on hand. Two Democrats are vying to take on Miyares in November. Former Norfolk delegate Jerrauld C. “Jay” Jones raised $931,242 and had nearly $1.5 million in the bank. Henrico County Commonwealth’s Attorney Shannon Taylor raised $534,275 and had $666,324 on hand.
Big-money speaker
In House of Delegates fundraising, there’s House Speaker Don Scott (D-Portsmouth) and then there’s everybody else — literally. Scott’s total of $813,254 raised for the quarter is greater than the combined amount of the next five best-funded House candidates around the state. With nearly $2.5 million in his war chest, Scott is running unopposed, so he will be able to share some of those riches with other Democrats in key races.
His top donor for the period was Dominion Energy, which gave $100,000 and has long been the most generous benefactor to leaders of both major parties. Scott’s other major contributors included state auto dealers and several casino interests.
Blue push for the green
Overall, the $3.7 million raised by Democratic House candidates was more than double the $1.5 million total raised by Republicans for the three months, according to VPAP. The gap narrows when it comes to cash on hand — Democratic candidates have a total of a little more than $9.3 million; Republicans have almost $6.5 million.
Democrats hold a 51-49 majority in the House of Delegates and are hoping anti-Trump fervor will help them pick up a few more seats; the last time Donald Trump was in the White House, Democrats made stunning gains and took their first House majority in a generation. This year, Democratic candidates are running in 91 of the 100 House districts, while Republicans are fielding candidates in 66 districts.
After Scott, the next four top House fundraisers in VPAP’s analysis are also Democrats. Candidate Lily Franklin came in second with $190,338 as she runs in a rematch with incumbent Del. Chris Obenshain (R) in the red-leaning House District 41, which is between Roanoke and Blacksburg in the western part of the state. Franklin, who has $243,466 in cash on hand, came within less than 1 percent of beating Obenshain when they ran in 2023. The Republican reported raising $50,180 for this year’s first quarter and has $88,743 in the bank.
In third place was Democrat John McAuliff with $170,820 raised for the three months in his challenge to GOP incumbent Geary M. Higgins in House District 30 in Loudoun County. Higgins reported raising $38,336 for the quarter, but his cash on hand of about $168,000 is greater than McAuliff’s war chest of about $141,000.
House Majority Leader Charniele L. Herring (D-Alexandria) came in fourth with a three-month haul of $165,265 as she runs unopposed, and rounding out the top five was former delegate Elizabeth Guzman (D), who raised $149,043 during the quarter as she tries for a comeback after two years out of office. With $114,100 in the bank, she is running in House District 22 in Prince William County against Republican incumbent Del. Ian T. Lovejoy, whose latest report was not yet available but who had about $26,000 on hand at the start of the year.
That district is one of at least eight Republican-held seats that went for Vice President Kamala Harris in last fall’s presidential election, according to a VPAP analysis, creating obvious targets for Democrats in what is expected to be a blue-trending year.
National targets
The Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee this month announced a seven-figure ad buy and highlighted four closely divided districts held by Democrats that are among the national organization’s priorities. In those four districts, Democrats outraised Republicans by a combined total of $296,013 to $191,963, according to VPAP’s numbers.
In one of those close races, though — House District 97 in Virginia Beach — GOP challenger and former delegate Tim Anderson outraised incumbent Del. Michael Feggans, posting $112,192 to the Democrat’s $60,265.",2025-04-17T01:19:00.000+03:00,https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2025/04/16/virginia-elections-governor-spanberger-sears,"Gregory S.

DEI et durabilité : les marques européennes les plus influentes selon le Brand Influence Index 2025,"DEI et durabilité : les marques européennes les plus influentes selon le Brand Influence Index 2025
Onclusive a publié la nouvelle édition de son Brand Influence Index – Europe, une étude qui évalue l’impact médiatique et social media des principales marques du continent à travers le prisme de leurs engagements en matière de diversité, équité, inclusion (DEI) et de développement durable. Dans un contexte où les critères ESG deviennent un levier clé de réputation, l’étude souligne des dynamiques spécifiques aux marques européennes.
Unilever, Tesco et SAP en tête du classement européen
Le podium du classement européen est occupé par trois marques qui ont su articuler de façon cohérente leurs engagements RSE et leur stratégie de communication. Unilever arrive en tête avec un score global de 32, grâce à une politique assumée sur la réduction des émissions, l’inclusion et la circularité de ses produits. Le groupe britannique est suivi par Tesco, porté par des campagnes sociétales visibles et une politique inclusive affirmée, et par SAP, qui se distingue par ses innovations technologiques responsables et ses objectifs environnementaux ambitieux.
Une approche européenne plus structurée, mais moins influente à l’échelle mondiale
Contrairement aux géants technologiques américains, qui dominent le classement mondial avec des scores d’influence dépassant les 500 points, les marques européennes adoptent une posture plus structurée, souvent alignée avec leurs engagements RSE, mais souffrent d’un déficit de visibilité à l’international.
« Les marques européennes reflètent la solidité de leurs engagements nationaux, mais restent en retrait face à la puissance narrative des acteurs américains », observe Onclusive dans son rapport.
La France bien représentée, mais encore timide
Première marque française du classement, L’Oréal se hisse à la 7e place européenne, portée par une forte exposition médiatique sur les sujets de mixité, de sourcing responsable et d’innovation durable dans le secteur cosmétique. D’autres groupes hexagonaux comme Dior, AXA ou BNP Paribas obtiennent des scores honorables, mais peinent à se positionner dans le top 5. Leur communication reste plus éclatée ou moins régulière sur les thématiques DEI et environnementales.
Des marges de progression importantes
L’étude révèle également que la présence médiatique des dirigeants européens reste globalement faible, à quelques exceptions près, comme Florentino Pérez, président du groupe ACS et du Real Madrid, qui bénéficie d’un fort capital d’attention. Par ailleurs, très peu d’entreprises, à l’exception notable de Tesco et Unilever, communiquent de façon régulière et stratégique sur leurs actions en faveur de la diversité ou du climat.
En matière de développement durable, des écarts marqués apparaissent entre les leaders (Bosch, SAP) et certaines grandes entreprises comme HSBC, qui peinent à crédibiliser leurs engagements.
Ce classement souligne combien les thématiques ESG — autrefois perçues comme périphériques — sont aujourd’hui au cœur de l’influence des marques. Les entreprises capables de relier efficacement leurs engagements à une communication visible et constante en tirent des bénéfices concrets, en termes d’image, de notoriété, et de cohérence stratégique.

Mocho councillor welcomes gov't response to water issues - Jamaica Observer,"Mocho councillor welcomes gov’t response to water issues
KINGSTON, Jamaica — Councillor for the Mocho Division, Romaine Morris, is welcoming a commitment made by Minister without portfolio in the Ministry of Economic Growth and Job Creation, Matthew Samuda, in addressing concerns raised about the Goshen Pumping System and water access in Mocho.
Morris, in a statement on Wednesday, said he acknowledges the government’s commitment to restoring and improving the water system and appreciates the interventions outlined, including the installation of a new pump and storage capacity upgrades.
However, Morris sought to remind the public that a comprehensive water supply plan had already been developed and approved through a collaboration between the Clarendon Municipal Corporation, the National Water Commission and Rural Water Supply Limited.

Mocho water system upgrades on track – Minister Samuda
According to Morris, this plan, completed before 2020, was designed to ensure 80 per cent water coverage across the Mocho Division. In 2019, funding was secured through Rural Water Supply Ltd, but was rescinded during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The proposal included a 100,000-gallon tank to be built at the highest point in Mocho (land already secured), a $18 million estimate provided by Tankweld Ltd, and water piped from the Goshen system to the tank, then gravity-fed to underserved districts: Belmont, Stewarton, Richmond Park, Mount Airey, Folly, Green Park, Ashley, Mocho Reid, and several schools.
Morris is now advocating to expand the tank to 200,000 gallons, making it possible to extend piped water to the Toll Gate Division as well.
“I am ready to meet with Minister Samuda and his team to bring this vision to life. The people of Mocho have waited long enough,” said Morris.",2025-04-17T00:53:00.000+03:00,https://www.jamaicaobserver.com/2025/04/16/mocho-councillor-welcomes-govt-response-water-issues,KEVIN JACKSON; Observer writer,positive

Powered by readers: How a Berlin newspaper thrives without a paywall | International Journalists' Network,"“Free access to information is essential for a democratic society”, says Aline Lüllmann, CEO of the Berlin-based daily taz. die tageszeitung. In times of war, social and economic crises, rampant disinformation, and tech giants pulling the plug on fact-checking programs, her words couldn’t ring more true. Yet, in this dystopian media landscape, taz has seemingly carved out something close to a news utopia and takes a radically different approach: It trusts its digital readers to pay voluntarily – no paywall, no restrictions, “taz I pay” (German: “taz zahl ich”). And so far, 42,000 readers have committed and stepped up, many of them supporting taz since voluntary contributions began in 2011.
The average contribution size is six euros per month, but there’s others who give 150 euros on a monthly or yearly basis. This is how community is fostered, Lüllmann reckons: “We know our contributors very well. The taz team calls them regularly, they’re getting newsletters and are being invited to many events.” This has brought in around three million annually, accounting for nine percent of their total revenue.
“We could not imagine introducing a paywall and economically we don’t have to”, adds taz’s editor-in-chief Barbara Junge. While the leading team doesn’t approve of the fact that more and more other media are raising paywalls, they also recognize that the competitors’ prices are approaching what their readers are willing to pay voluntarily. The New York Times for example offers a subscription for its European readers at eight euros a month, while German Spiegel Online prices its digital subscription model at six euros per week. But don’t be mistaken: taz’s regular voluntary contributors aren’t its subscribers. The left-wing paper relies on multiple revenue sources. Digital subscribers pay for access to a PDF version of the print edition, while voluntary contributors simply read the same online articles available to all and choose to donate to support the paper.
If you have less, you give less
“Our information stands out from others and it’s therefore all the more important that it’s freely accessible”, says Lüllmann, emphasizing taz’s left-leaning perspective and its commitment to transformative reporting. This journalism is also reflected in the character of their readers and contributors, who pay not only for themselves, but also for others who have less – always promoting the solidarity motive of the newspaper on which it was founded.
Established in 1978 as a grassroots alternative to mainstream media, taz. die tageszeitung has always been politically independent and collectively minded. In 1992, it took a radical step to secure its future by becoming a cooperative, owned by its readers and supporters. Today, 24,000 members ensure taz remains ad-free and financially independent, with each member having an equal vote – no big investors, no corporate influence. Becoming a cooperative member requires a one-time share purchase starting at 500 euros. Each member, regardless of contribution size, gets one vote in key decisions about the newspaper’s future.
Print and digital subscriptions are another revenue source and “solidary motive”, deeply ingrained in the paper’s history and identity, also carries across the pricing. Always driven by the idea that if you have less, you give less, because others will step up and make up for it with a larger contribution. Hence the “political price” as taz calls it stands at 62.90 euros per month while you can also sign up for a reduced fee of 41.80 euros without providing bank statements. Print subscriptions account for for 67 percent of total revenue, roughly 23 million euros.
Keeping a newspaper afloat, navigating a media crisis, and paying fair salaries to 300 permanent employees is no small feat, especially for taz. “It’s not easy to afford an apartment in Berlin on our salary”, Junge admits.
“Of course that’s not the norm but we do hear from some subscribers that they don’t even read us but continue to pay so others can and because they find it important that we exist”, says Junge, who co-leads the editorial team since 2020.
Connecting generations to invest in the future
One small dent in taz’ utopia is that, like anyone else, their supporters are aging. Their average print reader is nearly 65 years old, so are their cooperative members. Even though their voluntary contributors are about ten years younger on average, the really young generations – we’re talking Gen Z and younger Millennials – haven’t taken enough interest into paying for quality news yet.
“We recognize this and are running our first big cooperative campaign this year aiming to connect generations”, Lüllmann announces. The idea is that older cooperative members are buying shares for younger readers who would then also be able to participate in voting for the publication’s future. “When they turn 30 we will ask them if they want to take over the share and continue contributing”, Junge adds. Parents and grandparents can also gift younger family members shares and there’s an option to pay off the 500 euros in installments.
Be a love brand
Nevertheless, veteran journalist Junge concedes, it is also the forms of produced journalism which have to be reevaluated to attract future generations: paperwise taz added a new “future” section to their weekly with constructive journalism at its heart, focused on “climate, science and utopia” in 2022. In 2019 they had already started a climate offensive to focus on young people’s concerns and livelihoods. The paper is also ramping up its presence on social media and invests in video content. Like this they have already been able to make significant gains, Junge says: “Two thirds of the people signing up for a subscription through socials used to come from our Facebook page, which is mostly used by an older age group. Now we see significantly more signups through Instagram which makes us think these readers are younger.” After the German election which saw significant gains for far-right extremist and conservative parties, taz offered subscriptions at ten euros for ten weeks. “Compared to the same months last year our share of readers in the age group 25 to 34 years of age doubled from ten to 19 percent”, Lüllmann proudly announces.
All the more reason for Junge and Lüllmann to stick with their voluntary and solidary model and push bold changes because according to them, the paper has never been as successful as in the past three years. Taz will seize its daily print operations starting in October, only offering digital subscriptions to the daily paper and a weekly print edition – although this might cost them up to 18 percent of current subscribers as surveys have shown. And: the paper’s income still heavily relies on print, accounting for more than two thirds of total revenue. “For some older readers it’s really hard to change habits”, explains Lüllmann, who will soon depart on a national tour together with Junge and basically the whole editorial staff in turns to assist people in making this switch they call the “page turn” (German: “Seitenwende”). The decision to deprioritize print was made because of rising shipping costs but made possible by voluntary contributions.
But could this model work for other media with a different founding history? “Even though we can be a tough read, it is still a love brand – if you’ve been with for us a while, you definitely have strong feelings towards the paper and I would say that’s necessary for the model to work – even if your paper’s DNA isn’t inherently left-wing”, the CEO summarizes. In the past there have been talks with The Guardian, which has adopted the same strategy since 2016. Yet, taz remains unique in how deeply its readers are embedded in its funding model – not just through voluntary contributions, but also as cooperative members who help shape its future.

""Marriage is the fundamental cornerstone of strong families and strong communities, and we need to make sure Indiana's tax and benefits systems aren't penalizing Hoosiers for getting married,"" he wrote.
Braun's office listed higher earnings for married people throughout their lifetime as one of the benefits of marriage. It also cited research findings that ""the top predictor of upward mobility for children was the number of intact families around them.""
The governor identified marriage as ""the fundamental building block of families and society for millennia"" and part of a ""success sequence"" consisting of graduating from high school, obtaining full-time employment and waiting until at least the age of 21 before getting married and having children.
""Research initially conducted during the Clinton administration found only 2% of American adults who follow the 'success sequence' are in poverty and nearly 75% are in the middle class,"" the order stated. ""More recent research found that 97% of Millennials who follow the success sequence are not poor by the time they reach their prime young adult years (ages 28-34), but 53% of young adults who did not follow this sequence at all are in poverty.""
The executive order also said The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 ""eliminated some of the disincentives to marriage in federal welfare programs, but disincentives persist due to how income of a cohabiting partner or spouse is factored into eligibility.""
Braun's office listed examples of what it says are Indiana's tax policies that fail to incentivize marriage, noting that single individuals can deduct up to $3,000 in rent expenses from their taxes while a married couple filing jointly has an identical exemption cap of $3,000.
Similarly, married and single people have the same maximum credit of $1,500 for their 529 contributions.
The executive order directed the Indiana Department of Revenue, as well as all other state agencies that administer either welfare or benefit programs, to ""estimate the amount of financial disincentive the current laws and policies place on marriage"" and ""recommend changes to the tax laws and policies that incentivize marriage and remove additional burdens being placed on those [who] are married.""
Agencies that deal with tax policies must provide a report by July 1 outlining recommended changes to remove marriage penalties, while agencies centered on benefit programs must do the same by July 1, 2026.
The executive order also expressed concern that ""disincentives continue to exist as welfare participation reduces the likelihood of marriage while the mother is receiving benefits.""
""Signed in time for Tax Day, this executive order will make sure Indiana's policies are providing an incentive for Hoosiers to build strong families, rather than getting in the way,"" Braun wrote.

中国経済が１－３月期の輸出繰り上げにより５．４％成長した。中国国家統計局は「内需と輸出多角化が効果を上げた」としながらも、「外部環境がますます複雑で深刻化している」と診断した。
中国国家統計局の盛来運副局長は１６日、「１－３月期の国内総生産（ＧＤＰ）は前年同期比５．４％増加した」と発表した。トランプ米大統領が貿易戦争を始めてから中国が出した初の経済成績表で、昨年１０－１２月期の成長率と同じだ。今年の年間成長率目標である５．０％だけでなく専門家らが予想した５．１％を上回る数値だ。
中国の１－３月期のサプライズ成長率は米国の「関税爆弾」を避けるために繰り上げた輸出が寄与したと評価される。１－３月期の中国の輸出は前年同期比６．９％増え、昨年１－３月期の輸出増加率４．９％より大きく膨らんだ。これに対し輸入は６．０％減少し、輸出入総額は１．３％の増加にとどまった。昨年中国の１－３月期輸出入総額増加率が５．０％だったことと比較すると減少幅が大きい。
今後が問題だ。米国が課した合計１４５％の関税に耐えられるかがカギだ。盛副局長は「短期的な圧迫はあるだろうが、長期的な流れに影響を及ぼすことはないだろう」と強調した。成長率目標達成に自信を持つ中国と違い、西側金融圏の見通しは暗い。最近モルガン・スタンレーは今年の中国のＧＤＰ成長率推定値を４．５％から４．２％に、ＵＢＳは４．０％から３．４％にそれぞれ引き下げた。中国の１－３月期成績表をめぐりフィナンシャル・タイムズは「中国の家計が深刻な不動産沈滞から回復に向け力を入れているタイミングで世界１・２位の経済大国間の完全なデカップリング（脱同調化）が懸念される」と指摘した。

$65 million project aims to improve Downriver rail crossing,"WOODHAVEN, Mich. – For decades, the Allen Road Canadian National rail crossing in Woodhaven has been a nightmare for drivers.
“One day I got caught three times by the train, just going in and out,” said Elaine Melnar, who has lived in Woodhaven for decades. “It’s been a headache ever since I moved in ’79.”
More than 30,000 vehicles, including 2,100 commercial trucks, traverse the crossing daily. Train passages cause average delays of nine minutes, accumulating to roughly an hour of total stoppage time each day, according to Wayne County.
“You can run up to the store, you can get stopped on the way there and start back (and get stopped). You got about a half hour each way sometimes,” Woodhaven resident Steve Mosley said.
A $65 million infrastructure project began this week to eliminate this traffic headache.
Scheduled for completion in November 2027, the project aims to separate vehicle and train traffic at the rail crossing.
“We’re going to drop the vehicular road down a little bit. We’re going to raise the rail line up a little bit to be able to create that separation so the rail, the train, can do its thing, and vehicles can do their thing,” Wayne County Department of Public Services Director Dayo Akinyemi said.
The current phase focuses on relocating utility lines to prepare for the rail bridge construction. While this preliminary work won’t significantly impact traffic, the project’s main phase will require a complete closure of the crossing.
“We’re going to have a complete closure and detour, but that is at least a good 12 to 18 months from now,” Akinyemi said. “We’re going to make a different level of outreach to the community and educate them.”
As part of this project, there will be a pump station installed to prevent flooding on Allen Road under the rail bridge.

质量为王
筑牢重点项目根基
一桥入云霄，天堑变通途。在青海省黄南藏族自治州同仁市扎毛乡扎毛河谷中，扎毛河特大桥一根根桥柱拔地而起、高耸入云，大桥已经雄姿初现。
“目前，大桥主墩已全部进入线上结构的紧张施工。”中铁十一局同赛项目党支部书记鄢昌宇说，“我们组织了136名精兵强将，加班加点，保质保量推进桥梁的建设，目前施工进度总体可控，预计今年10月底，大桥实现合龙。”
扎毛河特大桥是同仁至赛尔龙高速公路上的控制性工程之一。大桥地处青藏高原与黄土高原交接地带，平均海拔3500米，全长2.08公里，共计35跨，是一座典型的高墩大跨径桥梁，其中10号主桥墩高151.7米，相当于50层楼高，是青海在建第一高墩，施工难度大、技术要求高。
2022年7月破土动工以来，为高质量建设这座大桥，面对高寒缺氧以及大风、秋雨、冬雪频发等不利因素，中铁十一局集团有限公司的工程技术人员前瞻性地制定了科学的施工方案，严把原材料进场关，实行首件认可制，运用信息化手段加强质量管控，采用液压爬模等多项先进技术，确保了大桥建设的稳步推进。
目前，扎毛河特大桥连续刚构采用了安全可靠的菱形挂篮施工工艺，在挂篮行走前、行走中、行走完毕后均进行专项验收及领导带班盯控，确保挂篮施工过程中的安全；同时还采用了挂篮信息化监测系统，对受力部位及检查难度大的部位进行实时监测，有问题提前预警报警，从而为连续刚构挂篮的施工提供“双保险”。
夯实发展根基，积蓄腾飞之势。青海省坚持科技创新引领，强化质量安全管控，持续优化施工方案，确保各项工程在安全、保证质量的前提下高效推进。各项目建设者面对恶劣天气条件，依然奋力决战，迎风雪、战风寒，用实际行动展现了交通建设者的责任与担当。
“四新技术”
助力打造品质工程
在湟源至西海段高速公路施工现场，上千名建设者正紧锣密鼓地推进路基土石方、桥梁和隧道工程建设。公路全长约50.6公里，是国家高速G0612西宁至和田高速公路的重要组成部分。
在施工过程中，建设者加强新技术、新工艺、新材料、新设备的应用，高质量高标准推进工程建设。建设智慧梁场，通过集约化、工厂化建设，比传统模式预制梁场缩减了一半的占地面积，有效减少了建设成本，提升了生产效能，降低了人工劳动强度，减少了现场污染，实现了低碳化建设。采用全自动智能化设备，推动实现了“机械化换人、智能化减人”的目标，全面提升了工程建设的“专业化、精细化、标准化”水平。同时，采用钢筋集中加工配送中心，提高了钢筋加工精度和产能，保证了钢筋间距及保护层厚度合格率，增强了桥梁耐久性。
此外，项目还采用全自动移动台座及信息化智能模板，有效减少模板变形、避免梁体损伤。智能化附着式振捣器的应用，有效控制了振捣时间及频率，提升了混凝土强度和密实度。智能混凝土布料系统的使用，使混凝土运输、浇筑更加智能高效。智能化蒸汽养生中心的应用，则实现了智能蒸养、节能高效、恒温恒湿。
截至目前，项目累计完成产值14.49亿元，完成总量的38.5%，其中路基土石方工程累计完成总量的65%；隧道工程开挖掘进累计完成总量的66%；桥梁桩基工程累计完成总量的75.82%；桥梁上部结构预制安装累计完成总量的28.56%。
这只是青海省交通控股集团有限公司紧紧围绕“平安百年品质工程”建设目标，不断加强全过程质量控制，大力开展“新技术、新工艺、新材料、新设备”四新技术在施工中推广应用的一次生动实践。实践证明，“四新”技术有效提高了工程质量及施工进度，助力打造品质工程。
开局良好，但并不意味着压力减小。今年，青海省紧盯任务目标，对在建项目进一步优化服务，加快建设进度，确保重点项目建设顺利推进；对计划竣工项目，督促项目单位倒排时间节点，落实投资进度和实物工程量，切实做好收尾工作，确保项目早投产、早见效。
咬定目标不放松，心无旁骛谋发展。有了重点项目建设一季度稳中向好的良好基础，全省年度项目建设更加令人期待。青海交通建设正以“快进键”的速度，为全省经济社会高质量发展筑牢根基，积蓄力量。",2025-04-17T00:13:00.000+03:00,https://finance.sina.com.cn/jjxw/2025-04-17/doc-inetmcyi9612909.shtml,sina.com.cn,positive

《時代》百大影響力人物 川普政府六人上榜,"【大紀元2025年04月17日訊】（大紀元記者李馨綜合報導）美國《時代》（Time）週刊週三（4月16日）公布了該雜誌「全球百名最具影響力人物」名單，美國總統川普（特朗普）及其政府的五名成員上榜，這也是自2009年以來單一政府入選人數最多的一次。
在《時代》週刊公布的2025年度全球100位最具影響力人物（100 Most Influential People of 2025）名單上，川普及其政府的五名成員入選，他們是：副總統萬斯（JD Vance）、總統高級顧問埃隆‧馬斯克（Elon Musk）、衛生與公眾服務部（HHS）部長小羅伯特‧肯尼迪（Robert F. Kennedy Jr.）、商務部長霍華德‧盧特尼克（Howard Lutnick），以及白宮行政管理和預算局（Office of Management and Budget，簡稱OMB）局長拉塞爾‧沃特（Russell Vought）。
在一屆政府中共有六名官員入選《時代》雜誌年度「全球百名最具影響力人物」名單，這是最大的單一政府入選陣營，也是自2009年以來的首次。上一次的紀錄是由美國前總統奧巴馬的政府創下的，當時正值其第一任期之初。
《時代》週刊這一百強榜的評選與該雜誌的「年度風雲人物」（Person of the Year）評選是分開的。
川普也是《時代》週刊2024年的「年度風雲人物」，該雜誌於去年12月宣布了這一評選結果。
到4月30日，川普的第二任期將滿100天，儘管時間不長，但他的議程已經對美國的移民、外交政策、國際貿易和聯邦勞動力等問題產生了巨大影響。
《時代》雜誌資深記者布萊恩‧貝內特（Brian Bennett）在談到川普的影響力時寫道，「沒有哪位現代總統像唐納德‧川普那樣強有力地控制了美國政府。」他補充說，在接下來的任期中，川普將繼續展現他能對美國和全世界施加多大的影響力。
《時代》週刊華盛頓分社社長馬西莫‧卡拉布雷西（Massimo Calabresi）在談到萬斯的入選時強調，萬斯作為川普政府的二把手發揮了重要作用。
馬斯克正在領導政府效率部（DOGE）對聯邦機構進行大刀闊斧的改革，並因大量裁減政府雇員、縮減聯邦機構規模而引發了巨大爭議。
肯尼迪是一名反疫苗倡導者，《時代》指出，他在改變美國醫療政策方面正在發揮重大作用。
盧特尼克長期以來一直主張對從其它國家進口的商品徵收關稅，以刺激美國製造業的發展，並對那些他認為不利的貿易政策進行懲罰。在當前川普政府的關稅戰中，盧特尼克所處的地位和作用尤其重要。
沃特是川普團隊中不太引人注目的成員之一，但《時代》週刊指出，他是「川普令人震驚的第二任期議程的設計師」。
《時代》雜誌資深政治記者埃里克‧科特萊薩（Eric Cortellessa）寫道：「沃特也許會保持低調，但他是這場顛覆華盛頓的革命的思想燈塔。」

DOJ backs local mosque in fight with Town of Oyster Bay over expansion - NewsBreak,"Efforts to expand a local mosque in Bethpage received a major boost from the Department of Justice. The DOJ backed its claims that the Town of Oyster Bay's decision to reject its application was unfair. ""Muslims on Long Island"" is suing the Town of Oyster Bay after its application to replace two buildings on its property in Bethpage with one larger mosque was rejected. The issue is parking, as the the initial application, filed in 2018, met the parking regulations established by the Town of Oyster Bay. But the town changed the regulation in 2022 - and now required nearly twice as many parking spots for the expansion to take place. MOLI says that would require it to scale back the expansion by 50%, making it ""of no use."" The Town of Oyster Bay says it does not comment on the specifics of pending litigation.

"ANCA Leads Nationwide Advocacy Drive for Azerbaijan Sanctions, Artsakh Return, and Release of Armenian Prisoners","April 2025 Capitol Hill Campaign Features Grassroots Demands for U.S. Action on Genocide Justice and Regional Security
WASHINGTON—The Armenian National Committee of America mobilized a broad-based, nationwide coalition of advocates for a powerful two-day campaign on Capitol Hill – April 1st and 2nd – advancing urgent calls for U.S. action to confront Azerbaijani and Turkish aggression, demand justice for the Armenian and Artsakh Genocides, and secure lasting peace and security in the South Caucasus. ANCA advocates participated in over 100 in-person meetings with Congressional offices and hand-delivered legislative briefing materials to all 540 House and Senate offices.
“Year after year, the strength of our Eastern Region delegation continues to grow – bringing a principled and passionate message of justice to Capitol Hill,” stated Dr. Ara Chalian, Chairman of the ANCA Eastern Region. “Our advocates carry with them the hopes of survivors, the resilience of our people, and the determination to ensure our story is told, remembered, and honored through concrete policy action.”
“We are building a movement that reflects the full geographic and generational diversity of our community,” said Oshin Harootoonian, Chairman of the ANCA Western Region. “Advocacy Days are not just about Washington – they’re about nationwide empowerment. This year, our Western Region was proud to send a record number of participants, with activists representing every corner of our expansive Armenian American community – from California to Texas, Nevada to Washington.”
“We are nurturing the next generation of advocates who will continue to defend Armenian rights on Capitol Hill and beyond,” stated Gev Iskajyan, ANCA National Grassroots Director. “It was inspiring to witness so many of our community’s youth take the lead in Congressional meetings, confidently articulating our demands for justice and accountability.”
A standout feature of this year’s ANCA Advocacy Days was the active involvement of university students and young professionals, many of whom are alumni of the ANCA’s youth empowerment initiatives, including the Hovig Apo Saghdejian Capital Gateway Program, Leo Sarkisian Internship & Maral Melkonian Avetisyan Fellowship, ANCA Rising Leaders and Lucine Kouchakdjian Capital Hill days, Kasparian Summer Academy, and the ANCA Western Region Internship Program. These young leaders – active in university Armenian Student Associations and chapters of the Armenian Youth Federation – brought passion, professionalism, and a deep personal commitment to the Armenian Cause. Their participation underscored the vitality and continuity of the Armenian American civic movement, as students from across the country took time away from their studies to advocate for justice and stand in solidarity with their homeland.
Coordinated by the ANCA Eastern and Western Regions, Advocacy Days featured comprehensive briefings and policy workshops, equipping first-time participants and returning activists alike for impactful Congressional outreach. Advocates presented members of Congress with the ANCA’s April 2025 policy memos, outlining legislative priorities that included:
Advocates urged lawmakers to sign a bipartisan letter to Secretary of State Marco Rubio demanding the immediate release of Armenian POWs, Artsakh leaders, and civilian detainees held by Azerbaijan. They emphasized the importance of imposing Global Magnitsky sanctions on Azerbaijani officials responsible for torture, sham trials, and gross human rights violations.
Participants advocated for a U.S.-backed peace process that includes tangible security guarantees for Armenia, addresses Azerbaijan’s attempts to derail peace through coercive diplomacy, and upholds the internationally protected right of return for Armenians of Artsakh.
The ANCA called for co-sponsorship of the Armenian Genocide Education Act—allocating $10 million to the Library of Congress to fund public education initiatives—while also urging members to issue public statements recognizing the 110th anniversary of the Armenian Genocide.
Advocates highlighted Azerbaijan’s systemic destruction of Armenian churches and cemeteries, and Turkey’s continued denial of the Armenian Genocide. They called for Congressional action to promote historical truth and cultural preservation.
“Advocacy Days are the very embodiment of civic engagement,” stated ANCA Chairman George Aghjayan. “They unite, in practice, our community behind our shared principles – securing Armenia, restoring Artsakh, protecting Armenian lives and land, and forging a safe and prosperous future for all Armenians. I am, as always, deeply inspired by our activists – from students to seasoned advocates – who traveled great distances to be here. Their participation is a powerful reminder to lawmakers that the Armenian American voice is organized, informed, and persistent in our pursuit of truth and accountability.”
The capstone of the two-day effort was a compelling April 2nd Capitol Hill observance titled “Reversing the 2023 Artsakh Genocide | Remembering the 1915-23 Armenian Genocide,” featuring remarks and support by Senators Cory Booker (NJ), Andy Kim (NJ), Ed Markey (MA), and Adam Schiff (CA), as well as Congressional Armenian Caucus leaders Frank Pallone (NJ) and Brad Sherman (CA), and Representatives Gabe Amo (RI), Herb Conaway (NJ), Jim Costa (CA), Laura Friedman (CA), George Latimer (NY), and Jim McGovern (MA). The event, organized by the Congressional Armenian Caucus and the Armenian American community groups, underscored a unified demand for decisive U.S. leadership: to impose sanctions on Turkey and Azerbaijan, to ensure the release of all Armenian POWs and hostages, to guarantee the right of return for the Armenians of Artsakh under international protection, and to end Turkey and Azerbaijan’s denial of their genocidal actions as a cornerstone to justice for these crimes.

1993 Jesup double murder brought to justice in court,"1993 Jesup double murder brought to justice in court
GLYNN COUNTY, Ga. (WTOC) - A double murder from the town of Jesup was finally brought to justice this month.
According to the District Attorney’s Office for the Brunswick Judicial Circuit, Larry Jenkins, Jr., 49, was convicted of two counts of Malice Murder, two counts of Kidnapping with Bodily Injury, one count of Armed Robbery, and one count of Theft by Taking for the murder of Michael and Terry Ralston.
This trial was the third time that Jenkins was tried and convicted for the same crimes.
Earlier this month WTOC talked with Josh Ralston, the son of Terry Ralston and younger brother of Michael Ralston.
Josh says his life was continuously turned upside down with each attempt to overturn his conviction.
“Why do they keep letting this happen… they didn’t have 3 chances at life… and now, he gets this third chance to go free,” said Joshua Ralston.
On April 10, a judge sentenced Jenkins to serve four consecutive life sentences with the possibility of parole, which was the maximum sentence that could be imposed. The case was prosecuted and tried by District Attorney Keith Higgins.
After the sentence was imposed, District Attorney Higgins stated “that I did everything I could to make sure that this conviction will stick and withstand any appeal. Going forward, I will do everything I can to make sure that Jenkins will never be free to hurt anyone else.”

从广交会看中国外贸新动能： 创新夯实产品竞争力 非美市场订单快速增长,"4月16日，第137届中国进出口商品交易会（以下简称“广交会”）进入第二天，客流量依然爆棚。身处展馆中，证券时报记者明显感觉到人流量更胜开幕首日，不少中国外贸企业也在这一天迎来“开张”，部分境外采购商结束观望开始陆续签下意向订单。
　　值得注意的是，在这一片热闹与喧嚣中，中国外贸的积极信号不断涌现：非美市场订单快速增长、外贸企业创新能力十足、有信心实现全年增长。目前，关税战阴云依旧，但中国外贸却在广交会这个窗口上，给出了一份充满信心的答卷。
　　 非美市场订单快速增长
　　证券时报记者走访广交会发现，在目前关税战尚有众多不确定性下，一些非美市场给中国外贸企业带来不少增量订单。
　　“开幕第一天，很多客户也是刚刚过来，所以来展台的还相对较少，但是第二天开始客户就络绎不绝地上门了。一个巴西客户直接订了一个柜，刚刚一位印度客户又订了约10万美元的货。”华联机械集团有限公司销售副总黄昌土说。
　　据介绍，华联机械集团有限公司以包装机械为主业，以智能化后道包装系统的研发制造、销售服务为核心业务，是面向全球市场的包装机械供应商。华联机械迄今已形成系列化、规模化生产的产品有7大系列200多个品种，年生产销售超20万台套各类包装机械。
　　黄昌土表示，公司近两年一直在积极开拓南美市场以及俄罗斯市场。“这两大市场这两年的增长率都比较高，可以填补北美市场。我们会继续加大国外市场的开发力度，今年以来已参加了10来个国外展会。”
　　与上述公司类似的是，上海亿力电器有限公司是一家主要从事高压清洗机、吸尘器、喷雾器、蒸汽清洁机、畜牧类清洁机等清洁类产品的公司，在中国浙江嘉善、河南南阳和越南海防共设有27.7万平方米清洁器具专用制造基地，该公司产品中心产品经理蔡通国告诉记者：“一季度公司订单一直在增长，尤其是欧洲市场在逐步恢复，俄罗斯市场增长比较明显，南美市场需求也比较旺盛。”
　　事实上，记者从不少外贸企业处了解到，目前在广交会上，来自东南亚、中东、非洲等非美市场的订单仍在快速增长中。
　　 外贸企业创新能力十足
　　除了非美市场订单的快速增长外，记者还发现，目前中国外贸出口早已不局限于传统贸易产品，一些更具技术含量和创新能力的产品也开始崭露头角。
　　在有着杭州“六小龙”之称的BrainCo强脑科技展台，该公司展示了用于工业机器人领域的“智能仿生灵巧手”，这是基于迭代多年、已被千余名残疾人使用的智能仿生手，最新研发出的可用于人形机器人领域的工业灵巧手产品。据介绍，目前，BrainCo强脑科技已完成约3亿美元融资并投入研发，在全球脑机接口领域中与马斯克的Neuralink为融资规模最大的两家公司，分别为非侵入式和侵入式领域的领军企业。
　　该公司技术销售朱自正告诉记者，作为机器人实现灵巧操作和人机交互的重要载体，BrainCo智能仿生灵巧手能够助力实现堪比真手的灵巧操作，为人形机器人拥有更广阔的商业化落地应用场景提供动能。
　　而广东凌度智能科技发展有限公司则是带来了高空幕墙清洗机器人凌空K3，据介绍，该产品专攻高层建筑外墙清洁，提升作业安全性与效率；凌光系列则针对光伏电站，保障面板清洁度，提高能源转换效率。
　　“目前我们的核心技术就是内置水箱，只需要9升水，就可以实现不断的循环过滤回收功能，所以不需要接水管。有了这个功能之后，我们可以达到不限高度的清洗，包括四五百米大楼的清洗。同时，这一产品的清洗效率是人工的3倍到5倍，在海外市场特别受欢迎。”广东凌度智能科技发展有限公司销售总监陈思宏表示，目前公司的产品已出口到20多个国家，像中东、英国、美国、东南亚等，出口已占到销售额的80%。
　　 不少企业有信心实现全年增长
　　对于在2025年公司是否能够再次实现增长的问题，在采访中，不少中国外贸企业都给出了肯定答复。
　　对此，黄昌土表示，公司目前海外销售已占到全部销售额的60%，在今年1到4月已完成了公司的既定目标。“目前，公司的订单已经饱满，已排产到6月份。”
　　济南森峰激光科技股份有限公司是一家全球性的金属成型自动化企业。该公司自动化事业部总经理杜启栋表示，公司销售额中有60%—70%来自于海外客户，今年在海外的销售额实现20%左右的增长。“中国市场有强大供应链以及全产业链的技术人才储备，我相信在未来贸易竞争中，中国有独特的优势，并不会因为单方面的调整影响中国的市场份额。”
　　杜启栋还欣喜地表示，预计今年公司将顺利完成每年10%—20%的增长目标。“在本届广交会上，我们已经签单超千万元，预计整个展会期间将签单超过4000万元。”
　　“关税战对公司有一定影响，但因为公司全球化布局，因此影响并不大。从订单情况看，预计今年会比去年还要稍好一些。”蔡通国说。",2025-04-17T01:09:00.000+03:00,http://field.10jqka.com.cn/20250417/c667524761.shtml,证券时报,positive

O evento é apoiado pelo Ministério da Saúde e será uma oportunidade para que pessoas lésbicas, gays, bissexuais, transgêneros, queer, intersexo, assexuais, pansexuais, não-binários e de outras identificações (LGBTQIAPN+) criem propostas de saúde pública para tornar suas condições de trabalho mais saudáveis e seguras.
“Falar de direitos humanos e não incluir o debate sobre práticas antidiscriminação e a urgência de eliminar o desrespeito e a exclusão da classe trabalhadora LGBTQIAPN+ seria um grave equívoco. Essa conferência trará propostas muito importantes para ampliar a mesa dos direitos humanos nos ambientes, relações e processos de trabalho”, afirma o coordenador-geral de Vigilância em Saúde do Trabalhador da Secretaria de Vigilância em Saúde e Ambiente (SVSA), Luís Henrique da Costa Leão.
A atenção à saúde dos trabalhadores mais vulnerabilizados – como os submetidos à discriminação – está prevista na Política Nacional de Saúde do Trabalhador e da Trabalhadora (PNSTT) . Pessoas LGBTQIAPN+ comumente sofrem agravos à saúde decorrentes de situações de preconceito, assédio, exclusão ou violências nos ambientes de trabalho.
Diretrizes e propostas serão construídas por meio da participação popular e levadas por pessoas delegadas eleitas à 5ª Conferência Nacional de Saúde do Trabalhador e da Trabalhadora (CNSTT), que acontece em agosto na capital federal.

Community Heroes: Tennessee Peacemakers Motorcycle Club helping community through kindness & giving - NewsBreak,"GREENE COUNTY, Tenn. (WJHL) — The roar of a motorcycle engine is unmistakable. Many riders wear a vest representing a group or club. One Tri-Cities motorcycle club is shining a positive light on the biker stereotype, and the members have a love for helping their community. Spring is filled with the sound of motorcycles, and the Tennessee Peacemakers Motorcycle Club of Greeneville is out in full force. “Our organization here is a group of men from all walks of life, who love helping our community, doing things for our community,” said member Joshua ‘Renegade’ Waddell. “We like to help kids around Christmastime, buying gifts, stuff like that. And Thanksgiving, we buy meals for families in need. I mean, that’s what, at the end of the day, that makes us happy.” Waddell says the tough exterior and loud motorcycles often receive mixed reactions. But, these members have a passion for helping others. “Honestly, if I had to say, they are the most caring community and the most loving, that they always, no matter what you see, they’re the ones always giving and trying their best to help.” Things like giving away bikes to children at Christmas, hosting Halloween activities, and fundraising for families who have experienced a great loss. “We don’t we don’t do it for credit,” Waddell said. “We do it to honestly be under the radar of it just because we don’t want the credit of helping these families, we just want to do it.” So the members will keep riding, finding freedom in the saddle of a bike, and a way to help others. “We all have a love for motorcycles. That’s the core thing that obviously brings a MC together,” he said. “But when it comes to children or helping our community, there is nothing that gives us a greater joy than just trying to help others.” For the latest news, weather, sports, and streaming video, head to WJHL | Tri-Cities News & Weather.",2025-04-17T00:56:00.000+03:00,https://www.newsbreak.com/wjhl-1589966/3965905271519-community-heroes-tennessee-peacemakers-motorcycle-club-helping-community-through-kindness-giving,,positive

Berkeley adopts first-of-its-kind policy to cut pollution from existing homes,"In a trailblazing move, the City Council in Berkeley, Calif., passed a policy Tuesday to cut pollution and boost utility affordability and resilience by modernizing homes when they are sold. The policy ensures that when a home changes hands, it has 21st Century upgrades that will help lower energy bills, improve health and safety during extreme weather events, and decrease air and climate pollution. Under the new policy, if upgrades are needed, home buyers can choose from a menu of options including heat pumps, solar and batteries, panel upgrades, insulation, EV chargers and more. Both home sellers and buyers will put in funds toward the upgrades.
“This policy will ensure that critical action is taken to make homes cleaner, safer, and more energy-efficient — preventing another generation of fossil-fuel-dependent appliances from being locked into homes,” said Tom Graly, Co-Leader of Berkeley Electrification Working Group . “This is a huge win for the climate.”
This is the first policy to leverage the point of sale to cut climate-warming pollution greenhouse gas emissions from existing homes. It will also cut the smog-forming nitrogen oxides (NOx) pollution that comes from burning methane in appliances and which causes asthma and other health problems.
This policy also helps people save money. Often before people sell a home, they buy new appliances to increase the appeal for buyers. According to real estate site Zillow, replacing a fossil fuel heating system with a heat pump before a sale has the best return on investment of any improvement, more than covering the cost.
Rather than home sellers investing in new fossil-fueled appliances, and home buyers paying extra for locked-in air and climate pollution, Berkeley’s policy will encourage sellers to make smart, modern investments that reduce emissions. The city will identify incentives, rebates or other resources to o-set the costs of upgrades. The policy will also help Berkeley homes prepare for upcoming Bay Area Air District requirements for pollution-free space and water heating appliances, requiring fewer retrofits down the line. First-time home buyers participating in income-qualified federal or state programs are exempted from needing upgrades.
“I’m proud of the direction Council took to implement BESO’s improvements, creating a shared responsibility between buyers and sellers to meet higher standards that support our climate mitigation goals, while also easing the financial burden through a thoughtful incentive program,” said Adena Ishii, Mayor of the City of Berkeley.
“Berkeley is largely built-out and much of our emission reductions must come from our existing buildings,” said Ammon Reagan, Sustainability Program Coordinator at the City of Berkeley. “This policy capitalizes on the homebuying process, at a time when resilience upgrades can be easily integrated into a new owner’s home projects and future renovations.”
In Berkeley, existing buildings are the second largest source of greenhouse gases. Space and water heaters powered by methane are the two largest sources of emissions from the city’s homes.
“This policy from Berkeley is ground-breaking,” said Ted Obbard of the Alameda County Chapter of Citizens’ Climate Lobby. “The upgrades to decrease air and climate pollution – paid for in this innovative way – will benefit families, community health, and the planet, and help transition homes across Berkeley to renewable energy.”
Berkeley has long been a leader in reducing air and climate pollution from buildings. In 2019 Berkeley passed a policy requiring new construction to be all-electric, the first policy of its kind. This leadership inspired a movement and similar policies passed across California, across the US, and in Canada. When a lawsuit, apparently funded by the gas industry , led to Berkeley’s policy and policies in other cities being thrown out, aected cities developed new approaches to reduce building emissions. Multiple cities have now passed new policies to increase energy efficiency and lower pollution from new construction. Berkeley’s new policy on existing homes has been in development for years, building on earlier energy disclosure requirements, and now can be replicated in many cities. All these policies together show the new momentum of local government action for clean air, energy efficiency, and climate.
“The way Berkeley has kept moving forward to protect people and the planet is amazing leadership, including this new approach,” said Anne Pernick, Senior Advisor at SAFE Cities at Stand.earth. “This policy will help the City meet its climate goals, while building momentum for local climate action in the face of aggressive opposition from gas utilities and the fossil fuel industry at large.”
“Berkeley’s BESO policy protects people where it matters most – inside their homes,” said Caytie Campbell-Orrock, Policy Director & Senior Researcher at Building Electrification Institute. “It offers a flexible approach that will help clean our air, future-proof homes, and support a transition to clean energy in ways that make sense for homeowners. This is a prime example of how climate policy can deliver real benefits to residents by improving health outcomes and increasing energy aordability. This innovative solution is exactly the kind of leadership Berkeley is known for.”
“Berkeley’s groundbreaking policy tackles harmful pollution at its source while giving homeowners real choices in how they meet the new green standards,” said Dylan Plummer, Building Electrification Campaign Advisor at the Sierra Club. “At a time when climate action faces challenges nationwide, Berkeley shows that they are still a climate leader. This innovative approach provides a blueprint for cities across the country looking to protect public health and reach their climate goals.”
“This policy is a totally innovative approach to steadily cleaning up the health harming, climate warming pollution from Berkeley’s buildings,” said Sam Fishman, Sustainability and Resilience Policy Manager at SPUR. “Berkeley is again showing leadership on climate and clean air, and they’re doing it in a way that makes sense for the community and homeowners. This policy will serve as a model for other cities across our region, and beyond.”
More on the policy: The new policy is the result of amendments to Berkeley’s Building Emissions Saving Ordinance (BESO) and will go into eect January 1, 2026. The policy will apply to single-family homes and buildings with up to four dwellings. With the new policy, if a home doesn’t yet meet emissions standards, the buyer will choose from a menu of upgrades, including heat pumps, solar and batteries, panel upgrades, insulation, EV chargers and more, that will make the home meet the resilience standard. Different upgrade options earn different amounts of points, and a home buyer would need to complete one or more upgrades to reach the required number of points within two years of the sale. Homes that already have at least one heat pump system, are all-electric, or where sellers have made sufficient upgrades in the five years before sale will not need to make additional upgrades. The city will identify incentives, rebates or other compliance resources to o-set the costs of upgrades. Both home sellers and buyers will put in funds toward upgrades. The funds will be used to reimburse the buyers once they make the upgrades or once they have obtained permits for the upgrades and can show evidence that they will be completed. The policy includes exemptions for first-time home buyers participating in income-qualified federal or state programs.

Gold hits new all-time high,"Gold prices hit a new all-time high of $3,300 an ounce on foreign markets yesterday as investors sought safe havens after US President Donald Trump called for an investigation that could fuel a global trade war, Bloomberg and Reuters reported.
At around 11:07 GMT, spot gold prices were up 2.2% at $3,299.85 an ounce, after previously hitting a record high of $3,317.90 an ounce. The price of the yellow metal crossed the $3,300 an ounce mark for the first time, surpassing the previous record set on Monday. Futures rose 2.6% on the US market at 08:01 local time, reaching $3,324/ounce.
""Trump's trade war shows no signs of easing, triggering a new move towards safe-haven assets and away from stocks,"" Ole Hansen, head of commodities strategy at Saxo Bank, told Reuters.
The Trump administration has called for an inquiry to examine the need for tariffs on all imports of rare earth minerals into the United States. The inquiry comes after China earlier this month imposed restrictions on rare earth exports in response to Trump's new tariffs.
Gold prices have risen nearly 26% this year, buoyed by tariff disputes, strong central bank purchases, expectations of interest rate cuts and bullion-backed exchange-traded funds. In this context, Australia & New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ) yesterday revised its forecast for the price of gold, anticipating a level of $ 3,600 per ounce by the end of the year, and $ 3,500 in six months.
""The advance is a little bit disoriented, leaving room for corrections,"" Hansen said, noting: ""However, for more than a year, we have seen that the corrections are superficial.""
According to Reuters, gold's Relative Resistance Index (RSI) is above 70, indicating that the precious metal is ""overbought.""
Ricardo Evangelista, senior analyst at brokerage firm ActivTrades, says: ""The fundamentals are too strong and I don't really see a scenario that is different from the general risk tilted to the upside.""
And Evy Hambro, an analyst at Blackrock Inc., said, quoted by Bloomberg: ""I would like to have a pound for every time someone said gold had hit a record high in recent weeks. The gold market is booming in this period of uncertainty.""
Major banks are expecting gold prices to rise in the coming quarters. Analysts at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. estimate the price will reach $4,000 an ounce by mid-2026.
""The power struggle between major powers will continue. Gold's appeal as a safe-haven asset makes an appreciation more likely than a depreciation in the short to medium term,"" said Luchen Wang, an analyst at Galaxy Futures Co.
Markets expect the U.S. central bank to cut interest rates at least three times this year, which will support gold prices.
This month, Juerg Kiener, chief investment officer and managing director at Swiss Asia Capital, predicted that the price of gold could rise to $5,000-$8,000 per ounce in the next few years. He highlighted the sustained momentum in the price, driven by global financial changes and strong demand from central banks, saying, as quoted by cnbctv18.com: ""The upward trend will continue and accelerate. The price of gold has already risen 30% from the recent lows, showing resilience amid economic uncertainty and geopolitical tensions.""
Juerg Kiener is optimistic about the long-term prospects for the yellow metal's price, considering it a refuge against inflation, currency volatility and instability.
This year's advance in gold prices comes after a rise of more than 27% in 2024.",2025-04-17T00:20:11.931+03:00,https://www.bursa.ro/gold-hits-new-all-time-high-23634556,BURSA,positive

Hycroft Mining (HYMC) Soars 8.83% on Drilling Success,"Hycroft Mining (HYMC) Soars 8.83% on Drilling Success
Hycroft Mining (HYMC) shares surged 8.83%, reaching their highest level since April 2024, with an intraday gain of 19.56%.
Hycroft Mining recently filed their 2024 10-K report, which included significant drilling success. This update has the potential to boost investor confidence and positively impact the company's stock price. The positive drilling results indicate that the company is making progress in its mining operations, which could lead to increased production and revenue in the future.
On May 5, 2025, [hycroft mining] announced their Q1 2025 earnings. The financial performance reported in this earnings call is likely to influence the stock price. Investors will be closely monitoring the company's revenue, earnings per share, and other key financial metrics to assess the company's performance and future prospects.
Hycroft Mining's stock has shown positive market movements, with a recent gain of about 9.5% on a single day. This surge in stock price could be attributed to the company's ability to leverage the surge in silver prices for capital. The company's strategic financial management and market positioning have likely contributed to this positive market performance, further influencing the stock price.",2025-04-17T01:32:12.937+03:00,https://www.ainvest.com/news/hycroft-mining-hymc-soars-8-83-drilling-success-2504,Mover Tracker,positive
Lago San Roque: la Justicia exige un plan urgente de saneamiento con control ciudadano,"Este miércoles, la Cámara Contencioso Administrativa de 3ra Nominación de Córdoba falló a favor del amparo ambiental colectivo presentado por la Fundación para el Desarrollo de Políticas Sustentables (Fundeps) en 2022 por el estado de deterioro ecológico del embalse San Roque, en Punilla.
Tres años después, la sentencia reconoce la existencia de un grave daño ambiental y responsabiliza tanto al Estado provincial como a las autoridades de los municipios de la cuenca regional por acción y omisión. A la vez, ordena una serie de medidas inmediatas y estructurales para garantizar el derecho a un ambiente sano.
“Esta sentencia marca un antes y un después. Reconoce que hay una crisis ambiental y sanitaria que afecta derechos fundamentales y exige respuestas urgentes, coordinadas y transparentes. Es un triunfo colectivo por el ambiente y la salud de miles de personas”, señaló Mayca Balaguer, directora ejecutiva de Fundeps.
La acción de amparo fue presentada por la organización en noviembre de 2022, luego de realizar una investigación sobre la contaminación del lago San Roque, visibilizada especialmente por la persistente proliferación de algas (cianobacterias).
Según explicaron desde Fundeps, estas algas están relacionadas directamente con los vertidos cloacales sin tratar, una de las principales fuentes de contaminación del embalse, que abastece de agua a la ciudad de Córdoba y a municipios del Gran Córdoba.
“La imagen del lago cada vez más verde, con esas floraciones de algas tóxicas, nos alertaba desde hace años. Lo que hicimos fue respaldar esa alarma con datos, estudios científicos, y llevarlo a la Justicia para que se tomen medidas concretas”, explicó Balaguer.
La sentencia
El fallo obliga a ejecutar de forma efectiva el “Plan de Saneamiento y de Desarrollo Sostenible”, presentado por la Provincia durante el proceso judicial.
Sin embargo, la Justicia estableció que ese plan debe ser reformulado en un plazo de 30 días, incorporando criterios de integralidad, urgencia ambiental, participación ciudadana y transparencia.
Uno de los puntos más relevantes es la exigencia de acelerar la cobertura de la red cloacal: mientras que la Provincia había previsto alcanzar un 50% en 15 años, el tribunal ordena elevar ese objetivo al 85% en solo ocho años.
“Esto eleva sustancialmente el estándar y marca que la cuestión cloacal es prioritaria. Celebramos que la Justicia haya entendido que no se puede esperar más”, subrayó Balaguer.
Además, la sentencia establece el cese inmediato de vertidos contaminantes y fiscalización intensiva, con sanciones a los incumplimientos; una auditoría técnica obligatoria dentro de seis meses para evaluar avances y cumplimiento; la publicación de una plataforma digital en 90 días, accesible y actualizada en tiempo real, con participación ciudadana abierta; la puesta en marcha de campañas sostenidas de educación ambiental en toda la cuenca; la participación activa de ciudadanía, organizaciones sociales y el ámbito académico en la planificación y el seguimiento del plan.
Responsabilidad estatal y participación ciudadana
Por otro lado, el fallo le da a la Autoridad de Cuenca creada por el actual Gobierno provincial el rol de contralor y ejecución del programa de saneamiento.
Aunque no desconoce la autonomía municipal, remarca el rol de la Provincia como responsable última en la protección del recurso hídrico, obligándola a cooperar técnica y financieramente con los gobiernos locales.
En cuanto a la implementación efectiva del fallo, Balaguer reconoció que el riesgo de inacción siempre existe, pero valoró las herramientas de control dispuestas por la justicia. “Se establece un mecanismo de seguimiento con informes semestrales y se habilita un espacio para auditorías y participación social. Esta vez hay un marco que da más garantías. Y desde Fundeps, como impulsoras de este proceso, vamos a seguirlo de cerca”.
Un proceso que comenzó con un diagnóstico
La presentación judicial no fue espontánea. En 2021, Fundeps publicó un informe sobre el estado de las principales cuencas hídricas de Córdoba.
El relevamiento sobre el San Roque fue especialmente alarmante: se documentaron las principales fuentes de contaminación, sus consecuencias y la ausencia de políticas públicas integrales.
“El saneamiento del lago debe ser una verdadera política de Estado, que trascienda gestiones. Para eso hace falta cooperación entre la Provincia, los municipios, la academia y la ciudadanía”, concluyó Balaguer.
Con este fallo, desde Fundeps se considera que se sienta un precedente fundamental para el litigio ambiental en el país y se abre una nueva etapa en la defensa del agua, la salud y el ambiente.",2025-04-17T01:23:00.000+03:00,https://www.lavoz.com.ar/ciudadanos/lago-san-roque-la-justicia-exige-un-plan-urgente-de-saneamiento-con-control-ciudadano,Fernando Agüero,positive

"上市券商一季度或迎""超预期开局"" 头部券商稳健领航、中小券商""弹性十足""_手机新浪网","上市券商一季度或迎“超预期开局” 头部券商稳健领航、中小券商“弹性十足”
近期，上市券商一季度业绩轮廓逐渐明晰，密集披露的业绩预增公告揭示了多家公司归母净利润显著增长的态势，凸显出资本市场回暖背景下券商板块的业绩弹性。其中，综合实力雄厚的头部公司持续领跑，中小券商则展现出“弹性十足”的业绩表现。
基于目前已披露的业绩预增情况，分析师普遍对上市券商一季度业绩持乐观态度，认为券商整体业绩有望超预期。开源证券非银金融行业首席研究员高超表示：“上市券商一季度业绩增速整体超预期，预计一季度交易量高增长、投资收益低基数是主要驱动力。”
业绩弹性足
截至4月16日记者发稿，共有9家上市券商发布了一季度业绩预增公告，均预计净利润实现较大幅度增长。
从头部券商来看，券商“新巨头”国泰海通预计一季度实现归属于母公司所有者的净利润112.01亿元至124.45亿元，同比增长350%至400%。中信证券预计一季度实现归属于母公司股东的净利润约65.45亿元，同比增长32%左右。华泰证券预计一季度实现归属于母公司所有者的净利润34.37亿元至36.66亿元，同比增长50%至60%。
同时，中国银河;)预计一季度实现归属于母公司股东的净利润27.73亿元至31亿元，同比增长70%至90%。中金公司;)预计一季度实现归属于母公司股东的净利润为18.58亿元至21.06亿元，同比增长50%至70%。中信建投预计一季度实现归属于母公司股东的净利润约18.43亿元，同比增长50%左右。
中小券商业绩表现则“弹性十足”。其中，东北证券预计一季度实现营业收入14.85亿元，较上年同期增长25.94%；实现归属于上市公司股东的净利润2.02亿元，较上年同期增长859.84%。华安证券;)预计一季度实现归属于上市公司股东的净利润为5.02亿元至5.58亿元，同比增长80%至100%。东吴证券;)预计一季度实现归属于母公司所有者的净利润9.12亿元至10.03亿元，同比增长100%至120%。
对于一季度上市券商业绩增长的原因，多家券商表示，主要得益于财富管理、投资交易等业务收入的增长。中信证券表示，一季度，公司锚定打造一流投资银行和投资机构的发展目标，积极服务实体经济，综合金融服务能力持续提升，财富管理、投资交易等业务收入同比增加较多。华泰证券表示，一季度，公司不断深化平台化、一体化与国际化运营，财富管理、机构服务、投资管理等主要业务线均同比显著增长。
国泰海通业绩实现大幅增长的原因，除了上述提及的财富管理、投资业务向好之外，还涉及公司之间的吸收合并交易。国泰海通表示，一季度，公司主动把握市场机遇，全面推进零售、机构和企业三大客户服务体系建设，推进各项业务稳步发展，取得较好经营业绩。同时，公司积极推进换股吸收合并海通证券相关工作，加速向国际一流投资银行迈进。一季度，公司归属于母公司所有者的净利润增长的主要原因为吸收合并海通证券产生负商誉。
“预计经纪与信用业务是上市券商一季度业绩增长的主要支撑，投资业务也同比改善。”国泰海通非银首席分析师刘欣琦预计，经纪及信用业务合计贡献增量收入的78.5%，是券商板块业绩增长的主要支撑。同时，预计投资业务同比有所改善。
经纪、信用业务成“增长引擎”
回顾今年一季度市场走势，Wind资讯数据显示，一季度A股日均交易额1.52万亿元，同比增长70.27%。上交所数据显示，一季度A股新开户数量为747.14万户，同比增长32.75%。
“一季度上市券商业绩的增长，一方面受去年同期自营业务低基数效应影响，另一方面得益于一季度股票成交量同比高增带动经纪业务收入增长。”中信建投非银及金融科技首席分析师赵然表示，4月份以来，券商板块经历短暂回调后，性价比再度凸显，看好板块后续估值修复动能，核心逻辑在于业绩韧性筑牢安全边际，政策与宏观环境改善形成双重催化，板块估值具备向上空间。
针对上市券商一季度整体业绩，方正证券;)研究所所长助理、金融首席分析师许旖珊表示：“预计上市券商一季度主营收入同比增长33.1%，归母净利润同比增长77.7%；剔除国泰海通吸收合并的负商誉影响后，预计一季度券商板块归母净利润同比增长51%。分业务看，预计一季度经纪、信用业务为券商业绩增长的主要驱动力，经纪、投行、资管、净利息、净投资收入分别同比增长65.7%、27.8%、2.8%、77.1%、2.7%。”

本报马来西亚布特拉加亚4月16日电 （记者李欣怡、袁子涵）4月16日下午，国家主席习近平同马来西亚总理安瓦尔在布特拉加亚总理官邸举行会谈。
习近平乘车抵达总理官邸时，安瓦尔热情迎接。马来西亚青少年挥舞两国国旗，奏响欢快的鼓乐，跳起热情的民族舞蹈，热烈欢迎远道而来的贵宾。
习近平指出，中马传统友谊跨越千年。两国友好在悠久历史中孕育，在文化交融中生长，在互惠互利中巩固，在风雨同舟中升华，展现了以心相交、以诚相待、以义为持、以和为贵的共同价值追求，体现出两国人民的历史智慧和勇气，是两国共同的宝贵财富。去年，双方隆重庆祝建交50周年。过去50年中马关系结出丰硕成果，双方要在下一个50年继续把握历史主动，勇立时代潮头，构建高水平战略性中马命运共同体，为两国人民创造更多福祉，为地区繁荣稳定作出更大贡献。
习近平就建设高水平战略性中马命运共同体提出三点意见。

Michelle Obama recalls her mother's surprising reaction to meeting Barack for the first time - NewsBreak,"Michelle Obama discussed her relationship with husband Barack Obama on the most recent episode of her podcast. Michelle and her brother Craig launched their IMO podcast - standing for In My Opinion - last month on March 12. Since then, the sibling duo have been climbing up the charts with a number of exciting guests. This episode featured Tracee Ellis Ross, and the discussion centered around dating. Michelle delved into her own relationship at the beginning of the episode. Her brother Craig fondly recalled the last time Michelle brought a new boyfriend home to meet the family - her husband Barack who would later go on to become the president of the United States. READ MORE: Flustered Karoline Leavitt has no answer as Trump accused of massive abuse of power READ MORE: Trump's 'real height' detailed in medical report after pictures cast doubt on claims However, it wasn’t Barack’s intellect or charm that their mother noticed first, but rather his height. The siblings laughed as they talked about how the family didn’t take their relationship seriously at the beginning. Craig said, “Mich pulls up to the front of the house, and we’re sitting on the front porch waiting for her to bring Barack. She gets out of the car and I remember mom’s first thing was, ‘ooh, at least he’s tall!’” The sibling cracked up recalling the now-distant memory, Craig then adding, “Well it’s too bad it’s not going to last.” Craig continued, explaining how his sister had asked him to take Barack to play basketball, and he was hesitant at first, not wanting to get too close to the man he believed his sister would not be dating long term. Michelle joked that in her youth, she only dated boys who her brother said were good at basketball. She asked what Craig’s impression of Barack was from the court, to which he replied that the former president was a “real team player.” Earlier this year, Michelle sparked divorce rumors when she missed a number of high-profile events including Donald Trump's inauguration and Jimmy Carter's funeral. Despite not addressing the whispers at the time, Michelle recently debunked all suspicions. During a chat with actress Sophia Bush on the Work in Progress podcast, Michelle said, ""That's the thing that we as women, I think we struggle with like disappointing people. I mean, so much so that this year people couldn't even fathom that I was making a choice for myself that they had to assume that my husband and I are divorcing.” ""This couldn't be a grown woman just making a set of decisions for herself, right? But that's what society does to us,"" She added, ""I chose to do what was best for me. Not what I had to do. Not what I thought other people wanted me to do."" Barack and Michelle met while working at a law firm in Chicago , in the late 1980s. They tied the knot in 1992 and share two daughters together.

龙赛罗：VAR裁判肯定是巴黎球迷；姆巴佩的表现软弱,"LaPulga 2025-04-17 06:27
皇家马德里在欧冠被阿森纳总比分5-1淘汰出局，《阿斯报》主编龙赛罗发布了个人专栏，题目为：结束了。
在本场比赛上半场中，VAR取消了皇家马德里的点球判罚，龙赛罗对此有着很大的意见，并直言VAR裁判是巴黎球迷，不想让皇马进入半决赛。
现实来临。这支传奇球队带给我们无尽的欢乐，让我们如此享受欧冠联赛——尽管这些回忆早已被报纸封存——或许我们被童话永不落幕的想法蒙蔽了双眼。赛前几个小时，球迷们上演的精彩场面，足以与这支自诩为联赛之王、曾15次欧冠夺冠的传奇球队相媲美。但这一次，这史诗般的壮举未能在一个尚未准备好迎接阿尔特塔的阿森纳将带来的战术和足球谜题的舞台上找到归属。安切洛蒂前一天呼吁“三个C”，试图给予球员们更多鼓励：“头脑（Cabeza）、内心（Corazón）和胆量（Cojones）。”可以肯定的是，整场比赛中，最重要的C都缺失了：实力（Calidad）。
糟糕的VAR。这家伙名叫杰罗姆-布里萨德，39年前出生于巴黎。看到他两次纠正同胞莱特西耶的判罚后，我只能得出一个结论：他肯定是巴黎圣日耳曼球迷，害怕皇家马德里闯入半决赛。更糟糕的是，他肯定对姆巴佩心怀怨恨，因为他离开王子公园球场时，没有留下一分钱。这才解释了为什么他花了超过五分钟才纠正了赖斯那次本来应该判罚的犯规。如果你需要五分钟来判断场上裁判看到的点球，那你就没资格待在VAR室里，这再次证明了科技正在摧毁传统足球。我不知道那次点球能否改变这部恐怖电影的情节，但至少我们可以享受几分钟的希望和兴奋，而这个巴黎人一心想让自己变得重要，我想，是为了满足他超级老板切费林的笑容，却把我们夺走了。
姆巴佩，软弱。我早就说过，在伦敦的比赛中，锋线三叉戟没能达到比赛的要求。我天真地以为，伯纳乌球场沸腾起来后，他们三个会集体反抗，打出他们人生中最好的表现。姆巴佩的表现不佳，至少维尼修斯在1-1的比分中奋力逼抢，打进一球，让一度麻木的伯纳乌恢复了活力。但从那以后，梅里诺、萨卡等人的足球就留给我们一成不变的印象。在那些时刻，我想象着克里斯蒂亚诺会是什么样子，一个在逆境中像巨人一样反抗的斗士。姆巴佩永远也成不了那样的人。我们必须接受现实。
美好的回忆。而那个日子无疑让我们充满乐观。1985年4月16日，皇马取得了它在欧洲最辉煌的成就之一。他们首回合在客场1-3输给国际米兰，随后凭借乌戈-桑切斯的两粒进球和戈迪略的一粒进球，迫使他们进入加时赛。加时赛中，桑蒂拉纳打进两粒惊人进球，让伯纳乌球迷欣喜若狂。多么美好的时光啊，但这些美好的日期已经所剩无几了。

"Rommel Pacheco: ""Por primera vez, el atleta tiene voz y voto en lo que pase en la federación"" - ClaroSports","Rommel Pacheco: “Por primera vez, el atleta tiene voz y voto en lo que pase en la federación”
En una charla íntima y reveladora con Claro Sports, Rommel Pacheco, exclavadista olímpico y actual Director de la Comisión Nacional de Cultura Física y Deporte (Conade), habló sobre la compleja relación entre política y deporte en México, los recientes logros de los clavadistas mexicanos, y las reformas estructurales que buscan dignificar la voz del atleta.
Política en el deporte
Rommel Pacheco no titubeó al reconocer la fuerte presencia de la política dentro del ámbito deportivo, incluso por encima de la esfera legislativa. “En el deporte hay mucha política. Cuando ustedes saben que estuve tres años de diputado federal, me decían: ‘Oye, Rommel, ¿y por qué en la política?’. Y les digo: ‘Ay, si supieran que en el deporte hay muchísima política y aparte muy compleja porque es política internacional’. Las federaciones son asociaciones civiles, hay intereses económicos… es parte, es parte”.
Resultados en la Copa del Mundo y contexto político
Pacheco celebró con entusiasmo las seis medallas obtenidas por México en la Copa del Mundo de Clavados, destacando la consolidación del talento nacional y el compromiso institucional para que los atletas compitan con dignidad. “Hombre, fenomenal. Seis medallas, dos de oro. Pues recuerdan bien los Juegos Olímpicos de Paris, donde Osmar y Juan Zelaya quedan en segundo lugar. Y estaba este debate de que si México era el oro o no, y ahorita México demuestra que se puede ganar. Randall, que en París se le escapó esa medalla, ahora no solo la amarra, sino que se lleva el oro”.
“Si bien México tenía ahí problemas con la Federación de México desconocida por la Internacional —a mí me tocó vivir parte de ese proceso cuando gano la Copa del Mundo, que no se escuche el himno nacional, que me suba con la playera de Popeye, que cante el himno nacional a capela—, y por ahí se estuvo diciendo que México iba a ir, pero que no iba a haber bandera. Y yo hice el compromiso de que nadie iba a sufrir lo que yo sufrí. Y por eso se iba a escuchar el himno, se iba a ver la bandera”.
“Eso es un trabajo en equipo. Los clavadistas estuvieron dos meses de campamento en China. Lo solicitaron para hacer ciertas correcciones en específico. Se remodeló el gimnasio de clavados del CNAR donde entrenan, y se mejoraron las becas. Se duplicaron las becas, cosa que en 21 años no pasaba a los medallistas olímpicos y paralímpicos”, afirmó.
Una nueva federación para los clavados
Uno de los cambios más significativos ha sido la reestructura de la Federación Mexicana de Natación, permitiendo a disciplinas como los clavados tener mayor independencia y representación. “Y hoy ya tenemos una federación de clavados. Se dividió la Federación Acuática de estas seis disciplinas que la conforman: clavados, clavados de altura, natación, aguas abiertas, nado sincronizado y waterpolo. Ya se conformó la Federación de Clavados solamente, de la familia de clavados. Ya va a ser una federación. El fin de semana pasado se conformó la Federación de Natación Artística… Lo que se busca es que los atletas se enfoquen en entrenar, competir y ganar. Y que nosotros, como Conade, Comité Olímpico y estas federaciones, nos encarguemos de toda esta parte estructural del deporte”, señaló.
Transformación en las estructuras federativas
Rommel subrayó que esta transformación no es un experimento improvisado, sino un modelo probado en países como Canadá y Estados Unidos. Además, celebró un cambio histórico: la inclusión real del voto del atleta en la toma de decisiones.
“Es un modelo, no es inventado. Canadá así funciona, Estados Unidos así funciona, y algunos otros países también así funcionan. Históricamente, por más de 30 años, cada disciplina levantaba la mano porque quería ser autónoma, quería ser independiente. Porque normalmente el presidente de la Federación, por lo regular, viene de natación. Porque el mayor número de clubes que votan en una asamblea para conformar la asociación estatal, y a su vez a la Federación, viene de los clubes de natación. Entonces clavados decía: ‘¿Por qué natación va a dirigir, si el que más medallas olímpicas da es clavados?’. Y natación artística decía: ‘Nos tienen olvidadas’. Y waterpolo: ‘A mí nadie me hace caso’”.
“Hay algo que se me olvidó mencionar, histórico en nuestro país: por primera vez en la historia de México, en la votación de la Federación, el atleta tiene voz y voto. Y no cualquier voto, no en un 1%, sino en un 40% de la elección y en un 40% en el Comité Ejecutivo. Tú dime qué federación acepta esto”.
“Y para mí fue importante. ¿Por qué? Porque el atleta es el que sufre, lo acabamos de decir. Es el que se ve afectado o, en su caso, beneficiado de una federación, pero nunca ha tenido la oportunidad de levantar la voz, de votar, de decir: ‘El presidente de la Federación lo está haciendo mal, remuévanlo’ o ‘El presidente o presidenta lo está haciendo bien, que continúe’. Creo que esto va a ser un parteaguas importante para el deporte de nuestro país. Y la idea es que esto se replique a otras federaciones”, agregó.
Relación con el Comité Olímpico Mexicano y visión integradora
Finalmente, Pacheco remarcó su disposición a trabajar en conjunto con todas las instituciones deportivas, dejando de lado el ego y priorizando el bienestar de los atletas. “Yo soy una persona que obviamente defiende, pelea, lucha —como deportista siempre lo hice—, pero también me gusta buscar el cómo sí arreglar las cosas. Para mí, lo más importante no soy yo. Yo hoy ocupo un cargo, un puesto, un lugar, pero soy un conducto para tratar de arreglar las cosas. Y tengo que trabajar de la mano con todas las instancias del deporte”.
“Como bien saben, la Conade es el órgano rector del deporte, según la Ley General de Cultura Física y Deporte. Y quienes conforman el Sistema Nacional del Deporte son las federaciones, el Comité Paralímpico, el Comité Olímpico, los institutos, entre otros. A mí me toca liderar, cobijar, coadyuvar con todos ellos. Cosa que a veces, entre el ego y el ‘yo soy’ y ‘tú eres’, a lo mejor no pasaba”, acotó.",2025-04-17T01:17:00.000+03:00,https://www.clarosports.com/otros-deportes/rommel-pacheco-por-primera-vez-el-atleta-tiene-voz-y-voto-en-lo-que-pase-en-la-federacion,Abraham Bencid,positive

Porter Vallejo Mansion undergoing renovations for new library,"PAJARO, Calif. (KION-TV) -- A historic part of Pajaro will be restored to become an even bigger part of the community.
The Porter Vallejo Mansion, once home to the Pajaro library, will be revitalized with a community space and an improved library.
The Mansion was damaged during the 2023 Pajaro flood with the library closed and a bookmobile taking its place.
""During the community meetings that happened after the flooding where discussions happened with the community on how use the AB 102 funding, this surfaced as one of the priorities for the community,"" County of Monterey Chief of Facilities Florence Kabwasa-Green said.
The Porter Vallejo Mansion will be transformed into a new library and a community space. Photo by Lindsey Selzer In the restoration, the county will focus on cleaning up flood debris, replacing the HVAC system and making needed repairs to the exteriors and interiors of the buildings.
The project will also see the addition of stairs and ADA lifts for access to the second and third floors and an outdoor area.
The Mansion is also the only building Pajaro the county owns.
""In Pajaro, there really is no county owned facility. This is it. This is the main county owned facility. And by refurbishing the second and third floors, we're gonna have a number of community space available,"" Kabwasa-Green said.

"Mujeres, mayores y votantes de izquierdas, los más preocupados por cambio climático - Infobae","Madrid, 17 abr (EFE).- Mujeres, personas mayores y simpatizantes de izquierdas son los más preocupados por el cambio climático en España, donde un 75 % de la población se muestra inquieta por su impacto aunque, desde 2021, ha descendido 15 puntos el compromiso individual con este fenómeno, según el último estudio de la consultora Ipsos.
El estudio 'Personas y cambio climático', realizado en 32 países, recoge que el 81 % de las mujeres españolas se muestra preocupada por el impacto del cambio climático, frente al 69 % de los hombres, y esa inquietud está más presente entre las generaciones mayores (84 % de los 'baby boomers' frente al 70 % de los denominados 'Z').
También afecta más a los simpatizantes de izquierdas que de derechas: preocupa al 89 % de los votantes de Sumar y al 80 % de los del PSOE, mientras que el porcentaje cae al 73 % entre los del PP y al 53 % entre los de Vox.
El nivel de la preocupación se mantiene estable a lo largo del tiempo en España, según el estudio, que recoge que este país es el primero de Europa donde más personas declaran que los últimos 10 años han sido los más cálidos que se han registrado.
La mitad de los encuestados considera que un aumento de las temperaturas mundiales por encima de 1,5°C es importante y, para uno de cada dos, el cambio climático es la mayor amenaza para la salud a la que se enfrenta la humanidad.
Sin embargo, la encuesta muestra que ha caído el compromiso individual, ya que la idea de que si cada persona no actúa contra el cambio climático se estará fallando a futuras generaciones ha pasado del 74 % que había en 2021 al 59 % en 2025, lo que sitúa a España entre los países europeos donde más ha descendido junto a Polonia, Alemania y Francia.
Lo mismo ocurre con las empresas, pues ahora sólo el 58 % de los encuestados españoles cree que si este sector no actúa ahora estará fallando a sus empleados y clientes, 15 puntos menos que en 2021.
Hay un importante descenso sobre si España, como país, debe hacer más en la lucha contra el cambio climático: un 58 % considera que sí debería hacerlo (67 % en 2023), y ha aumentado el porcentaje de personas que siente que se le pide a España que sacrifique demasiado.
Los ciudadanos son conscientes de que el abandono de combustibles fósiles hacia fuentes de energía renovables es clave en la lucha climática, pero el estudio muestra cómo esta transición se está encontrando con una importante oposición popular en Europa debido a sus costes.
Aun así, España es el país europeo con menos oposición hacia las renovables, ya que sólo un 38 % piensa que esa transición provocará un aumento del precio de la energía en los hogares, frente a los porcentajes mayores de Alemania (59 %), Países Bajos (56 %), Bélgica (56 %), Francia (54 %) y Suiza (51 %).
No obstante, se observa cómo son más los españoles (41 %) que no tienen una opinión clara sobre el posible impacto económico.
El director de Opinión Pública de Ipsos en España, Paco Camas, apunta que ""los datos de este estudio reflejan una sociedad con distintos niveles de compromiso y preocupación, que van desde el respaldo activo hasta la reticencia o, incluso, negacionismo"".
Camas asegura que las percepciones sobre el cambio climático y la necesidad de actuar ""están significativamente influidas por la ideología"".
El estudio de Ipsos se ha realizado con una muestra de 23.745 personas de 32 países de todos los continentes, mil de las cuales en España.

Türkiye expected to reach sustainable growth by 2026: OECD economist - Türkiye Today,"If Türkiye maintains its current monetary policies and enhances foreign investor confidence, it is expected to return to sustainable growth levels by 2026, according to an economist at the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).
Sebastien Turban, one of the authors of the OECD’s Türkiye economic survey released on April 10, told Turkish news agency Anadolu that the country’s current account deficit has narrowed, while inflation and inflation expectations have declined since the shift in macroeconomic policy in mid-2023.
Turban acknowledged that inflation remains high but is on a downward trajectory, emphasizing that both fiscal and monetary tightening must continue until inflation is under control.
“If the government achieves its medium-term program objectives and maintains this level of deficit in the long run, public debt and finances will be sustainable,” Turban said.
People stand next to a currency exchange board showing the Turkish Lira which fell to historic lows against the dollar, a day after the arrest of Istanbul’s Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu in Istanbul, Türkiye, on Mar. 20, 2025. (AFP Photo) Risk of premature relaxation He also noted that Türkiye’s Central Bank and fiscal institutions have committed to preserving the current stance.
“Looking at Central Bank communication, they are really clear that the monetary policy stance should remain tight until inflation is under control, and decisions on interest rates will be determined by the trajectory of inflation and expectations,” he added.
“We see a risk of premature relaxation, but it is a risk. The baseline for us is that we observe there is a strong commitment to those policies, and we see premature relaxation as a risk out of the baseline,” Turban said.
He further explained that macroeconomic reforms in the past two years have strengthened Türkiye’s external position and gross reserves, with net reserves excluding swaps turning positive for the first time since early 2020.
“However, the reduction so far has been observable but still significantly lower than the buildup that has occurred in the past two years,” Turban said. “We still see the increase in reserves as a really positive thing, and it has been critical.”
File photo shows an individual shopping in a grocery shop in Türkiye, accessed on Dec. 3, 2024. (AA Photo) ‘Unsustainably high’ growth in 2023 Before mid-2023, Turban noted that Türkiye’s growth was “unsustainably high,” but tighter policies have made it more stable.
The OECD expects Türkiye’s economy to grow 3.1 percent this year, partly due to continued monetary and fiscal tightening, which will create downward pressure on both inflation and growth.
“The potential growth of the Turkish economy right now for the OECD is assessed at around 4%. Potential growth is how much the economy can grow without putting too much inflationary pressure,” Turban said. “Our current projections show that in 2026, growth in Türkiye will return to this potential level—at this level, there’s no upward pressure on inflation.”
He emphasized that foreign direct investment and investor perceptions have improved due to macroeconomic measures, with credit rating upgrades contributing to growing international optimism.
“It is important to ensure that those investments are not volatile capital flows but more stable foreign direct investment,” he said. “This is part of the reason why we advocate for the policy stance to be maintained. Investor confidence can be built up.”
“Right now, what we have seen with communications from the Central Bank and fiscal authorities and from the decisions that have been taken in response to the current uncertainties, the commitment is there, and confidence in Türkiye is building up,” Turban concluded.
He stressed the importance of continuing this path to ensure that investor confidence continues to improve and that foreign investment flows become more permanent.",2025-04-17T01:19:00.000+03:00,https://www.turkiyetoday.com/business/turkiye-expected-to-reach-sustainable-growth-by-2026-oecd-economist-145728,@turkiyetodaycom,positive
Brunswick County manufacturing project gets greenlight after loosened wetland protections,"BRUNSWICK COUNTY — An economic partnership organization struggled to sell a county-owned property for years amid regulatory uncertainty due to on-site wetlands. Commissioners approved the sale after recent state and federal changes narrowed wetland regulations.
READ MORE: NC wetland regulations remain in dispute a year after state stripped protections
Commissioners approved the sale of a roughly 22-acre property in Leland Innovation Park to construction material manufacturer US MgO last week. The county worked with Brunswick Business and Industry Development, a nonprofit focused on promoting the county’s economic development in Brunswick County, to sell the vacant site for years.
“The property was difficult to develop, which is why we have been marketing [the] property for many years without success,” Brunswick BID Chair and First Citizens Bank Senior Vice President Allen Bryant said in a press release last week. “Today represents the culmination of multiple efforts by many people, and we are so thankful that US MgO is able to utilize this property and create jobs and investment in our community.”
Brunswick BID received $575,000 from the county, its primary funder, in fiscal year 2023-2024. Chair Mike Forte, vice chair Marty Cooke, and county manager Steve Stone sit on its board as non-voting members; voting members include Bryant, Cape Fear Engineering President Perry Davis, Novant Health Brunswick Medical Center President Heather King-Semple, and Moffitt Builders President Randy Moffitt.
The county agreed to sell the site at $35,000 per acre. Brunswick BID Executive Director Bill Early told Port City Daily he did not know the final sale price of the land.
“There have been some challenges with this property,” Early said at last week’s commissioner meeting. “Brunswick BID has conducted two environmental assessments of the property for wetlands jurisdiction. Originally, there was a large section that was considered jurisdictional. With some of the changes in rules, it has now been declared isolated.”
Multiple tracts have “unique geographical challenges,” Bryant noted in last week’s press release . Early told PCD a contractor determined there were approximately 1.19 acres of jurisdictional wetlands on one of the tracts in 2019.
“This information was important in allowing us to market the property for prospective users,” he said. “I believe in 2023 the US Army Corps of Engineers guidelines changed that isolated wetlands did not require mitigation requiring the purchase of wetland bank credits. A second wetlands delineation was completed in 2024 and the US Army Corps of Engineers agreed that the identified wetlands were isolated and non-jurisdictional.”
Early said USACE completed its study but had not yet issued a final determination letter.
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Wilmington District Public Affairs Chief David Connoly told PCD he would check with regulatory staff on the status of its determination. PCD asked the county for the site’s environmental assessments but did not receive a response by press.
The definition of “Waters of the United States” under the Clean Water Act has been at the heart of a national regulatory battle in recent years. Conservation groups, including the Southern Environmental Law Center , favor an expansive definition to protect environmentally sensitive areas that naturally mitigate flood risk.
Alternatively, a broad range of industry groups including the U.S. Home Builders Association, National Realtors Association, Farm Bureau, and Chamber of Commerce advocate a more narrow definition, arguing excessive regulations hurt business and constitute federal overreach.
The Supreme Court’s landmark 2023 ruling in Sackett v. EPA removed federal authority of wetlands without a “continuous surface connection” with other bodies of water — known as isolated or non-jurisdictional wetlands. The Department of Environmental Quality estimated 2.5 million acres could lose protection after the General Assembly-passed S.B. 582 in June 2023, which barred the state from regulating isolated wetlands that lost federal protection from the Supreme Court ruling.
US MgO is a member of the Carolinas chapter of Associated Contractors and Builders, a trade association that lobbied for a more narrow wetland definition. The group commended Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin’s announcement last month that his agency will review its guidance to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to ensure compliance with the post Sackett-ruling definition and reduce regulatory burdens.
Port City Daily reached out to US MgO founder Ryan Miller to ask about the project but he was unavailable for comment by press.
“After two years of research and development at our small facility in Leland, we’re thrilled to break ground on this major upgrade,” Miller said in last week’s release. “While MgO panels aren’t known to most folks, they are one of the construction industry’s most innovative building products. We’re excited to continue our growth in Brunswick County by building the nation’s first manufacturing facility for this product type.”
The company plans to build the 75,000 square foot facility on four parcels in Leland Innovation Park. It announced last week it would bring 35 jobs with an estimated average wage of $52 and $5 million in investment into Brunswick County. The company plans to use the site to manufacture high-quality magnesium oxide cement sheathing panels for construction markets.",2025-04-17T00:31:00.000+03:00,https://portcitydaily.com/latest-news/2025/04/16/brunswick-county-manufacturing-project-gets-greenlight-after-loosened-wetland-protections,Peter Castagno,positive

«Raddoppieremo le telecamere»  - L'Unione Sarda.it,"L’occhio attento e indiscreto del “grande fratello” del Comune di Assemini verrà potenziato. L’amministrazione comunale punta a incrementare gli impianti di videosorveglianza già distribuiti nel tessuto urbano, importanti strumenti con funzioni di deterrenza, ausilio alle indagini post reato e mantenimento degli standard di sicurezza. «Proveremo a raddoppiare il sistema di controllo, in base ai fondi», assicura il sindaco Mario Puddu.
L’esigenza nasce dalla volontà di contrastare reati di furto, abbandono di rifiuti e atti vandalici, l’ultimo dei quali denunciato a mezzo social direttamente dal sindaco Mario Puddu: «Ricordo che i cestini hanno la funzione di raccogliere soltanto rifiuti di piccole dimensioni. E invece, quasi ogni fine settimana, troviamo buste colme di immondizia. Non arriviamo al livello dell’abbandono del rifiuto in campagna o dintorni, ma poco ci manca». E avverte: «Abbandonare i rifiuti in questo modo è sbagliato, grave e sanzionabile».
La videosorveglianza
Gli impianti di videosorveglianza, installati nei principali beni immobiliari di proprietà dell’Ente, verranno rafforzati. Sei telecamere presidiano costantemente la piscina comunale, mentre altre sono state installate nel sottopasso di via Coghe. Sono stati inoltre manutenzionati e potenziati gli impianti di proprietà comunale nei sottovia delle vie Grazia Deledda e Sant’Elia con l’installazione di kit in alta definizione direttamente collegati al comando di Polizia locale.
L’adesione alla Consip è tra i prossimi obiettivi dell’amministrazione: «I nostri uffici - spiega l'assessore ai Servizi manutentivi Matteo Venturelli- stanno già lavorando per consentire al nostro Ente di entrare a far parte della “Concessionaria servizi informativi pubblici”, la società che si occupa degli acquisti nazionali delle pubbliche amministrazioni che fa capo al Ministero dell’economia e delle finanze». Ciò consentirà all’amministrazione di acquistare, a prezzi vantaggiosi, l’impiantistica dai fornitori che si aggiudicheranno la terza edizione del bando di gara a procedura aperta per la fornitura di sistemi di videosorveglianza e servizi connessi per le pubbliche amministrazioni.
Tra i progetti futuri, a livello di Città Metropolitana, c’è quello di collegare alcuni degli impianti comunali alla Centrale operativa dei carabinieri. La Stazione territoriale, per consultare le registrazioni, ha necessità di chiederle al Comando di Polizia locale.
La Polizia locale
I vigili oggi hanno un sistema di controllo dalla sala radio della Centrale operativa: «Circa 60 telecamere - precisa il comandante Danilo Piras - dislocate in tutto l’abitato. In periferia, a ogni ingresso della cittadina, sono presenti telecamere dotate di una tecnologia che consente la lettura targhe e in tutti gli edifici comunali ci sono telecamere di sorveglianza. Inoltre abbiamo telecamere di contesto in tutte le strade principali, nei sottopassi ferroviari e in tutti i parchi pubblici».

NSW Backs 240K Workers Aiding Vulnerable Residents | Mirage News,"The Minns Labor Government has today unveiled its plan to deliver secure jobs and long-term funding to the state's community services sector-benefiting over a million people who rely on these essential support services each year.
The Secure Jobs and Funding Certainty (SJFC) roadmap sets out a vision for a strong, stable, and sustainable community sector-one where funding certainty and job security empower service providers to plan ahead, support their staff, and deliver outcomes for the communities who need them most.
Under the former Liberal-National Government, community service organisations were trapped in a cycle of short-term, insecure funding-forced to reapply for government grants, often every year. This uncertainty flowed directly to the workforce, with many frontline staff experiencing job insecurity.
In contrast, the Minns Labor Government is delivering long-term certainty with five-year funding contracts. This reform means organisations can plan ahead, invest in their workforce, and focus on helping the people who need it-not fighting their way through funding applications.
We know that many people across NSW are doing it tough right now-facing housing stress, cost-of-living pressures, and increased demand for critical support. Community service organisations are on the frontline, helping people navigate these challenges every day.
These key reforms will bring greater stability to the sector-through five-year funding contracts, less red tape, and more secure jobs, with a focus on permanent employment pathways. More than 7,800 non-government organisations across the sector are expected to benefit, along with the 240,000 workers they employ and over one million people they support each year.
These frontline workers-most of whom are women-play a critical role in supporting the most vulnerable people in our community. Their critical work has been especially vital during times of crisis, from natural disasters to the pandemic, and in responding to issues like homelessness and domestic and family violence.
This reform delivers on a key election commitment and was developed in partnership with peak organisations, government agencies and the Australian Services Union in consultation with the community services sector.
The NSW Government will continue working closely with the sector to turn this shared vision into lasting outcomes for communities across the state.
Under the SJFC roadmap, longer term contracts will be balanced by clearer performance and outcome expectations, ensuring taxpayer money is being used effectively and efficiently, and always for the benefit of the community.
Further information on the SJFC roadmap is available here: https://dcj.nsw.gov.au/service-providers/secure-jobs-and-funding-certainty-for-community-services.html
Minister for Families and Communities and Minister for Disability Inclusion, Kate Washington, said:
""This is about backing the people who back our communities.
""The community services sector shows up every day for children, families, and vulnerable people across NSW-and they deserve the security to keep doing that vital work with confidence.
""This roadmap reflects a shift in how we work with the sector-towards longer-term partnerships built on trust, accountability, stability, and shared purpose.
""It's a foundational step in building a stronger, more sustainable sector-because when we support the people who care for our communities, everyone benefits.""
Secretary, Australian Services Union NSW/ACT, Angus McFarland said:
""The community sector workforce is made up of thousands of skilled and experienced workers, mostly women, who provide essential supports and services to the people of NSW.
""This roadmap is an important step in the government delivering on its election commitment to provide more permanent jobs for these workers via longer-term funding for the sector.
""The ultimate beneficiaries of these reforms are the people of NSW. Five-year funding contracts enable more permanent jobs in the community sector. This means greater stability for both the workers in the sector and for the community when accessing these vital services.""
NSW Council of Social Services CEO, Cara Varian said:
""We welcome the NSW Government's plan to give essential community workers secure jobs and stable funding.
""This plan shows that the government values the workers and organisations that spend their days helping the most vulnerable in our communities. They provide critical frontline services to support people facing homelessness, poverty, domestic violence, and trauma. This is essential work that strengthens communities and improves the health, wellbeing and resilience of NSW.
""This initiative represents a step change in the approach to human services contracting and commissioning in NSW. We commend this positive first step and look forward to building on this reform to strengthen and support the community services sector in NSW. We look forward to working with the Minister to make sure these services stay strong and continue changing lives for the better.""

一直以来，我国高度重视港口基础设施建设，在深水化、专业化发展方面取得显著成效，港口发展从规模扩张转向质量提升。例如，2024年宁波舟山港完成货物吞吐量约13.8亿吨，连续16年稳居全球第一位；上海港年集装箱吞吐量突破5000万标箱，创下全球港口集装箱最高纪录；山东省提出“推动港口与临港工业、城市服务功能深度耦合”，引导日照港形成临港产业与城市融合发展的新型生态。交通运输部此前印发的《关于加快智慧港口和智慧航道建设的意见》明确提出，到2027年，全国港口和航道基础设施数字化、生产运营管理和对外服务智慧化水平全面提升，建成一批世界一流的智慧港口和智慧航道。国际枢纽海港10万吨级及以上集装箱、散货码头和长江干线、西江航运干线等内河高等级航道，基本建成智能感知网。建设和改造一批自动化集装箱码头和干散货码头。全面提升港口主要作业单证电子化率。加快内河电子航道图建设，基本实现跨省（自治区、直辖市）航道通航建筑物联合调度，全面提升内河高等级航道公共信息服务智慧化水平。
在港口发展过程中，还存在一些亟待解决的问题。例如，核心港口群承载压力与内河港口功能弱化并存，清洁能源应用与污染治理体系尚未形成规模效应，同质化竞争导致资源配置效率低下，等等，尤需多措并举化解难题。
强化枢纽功能。构建多层次港口体系，围绕国家战略布局打造枢纽集散效应，依托青岛港、宁波舟山港等核心枢纽，增强全球航线网络密度，深化海陆双向资源整合能力。通过货物吞吐量规模优势，深度嵌入全球大宗商品价值链，形成兼具流量控制与定价影响力的资源配置中枢。提升内河联运效能，以长江黄金水道与京杭大运河为载体，构建专业化码头集群与联运网络，系统性破解传统多式联运效率瓶颈。以差异化考核机制引导唐山港、湛江港等聚焦铁矿砂、LNG等特色货类，解决同质竞争的问题。
深化数智转型。构建敏捷性基础设施，聚焦数字孪生与区块链单证技术突破，推动全自动化码头设备调度与风险预警体系智能化重构。深度优化能耗管理曲线，显著降低船舶作业碳足迹，实现绿色低碳转型目标。打造互联性数据生态，依托跨区域港口大数据中心构建全域协同平台，打通海关、物流与金融系统数据孤岛，形成电子单证互认与通关流程标准化体系。在智慧口岸建设方面，通过流程再造缩短通关周期，为跨境贸易提供确定性服务保障。引领前沿性规则创新，设立数字化专项基金，培育自动驾驶集卡、高精度导航等场景标杆，同步主导国际自动化码头技术标准制定。
创新治理机制。突破外资准入限制，拓展规则对接维度，对标RCEP框架，建立港口作业时限与收费标准互认机制，深度融入区域贸易便利化框架。强化港航和海事的信息互换和监管互动，加强与海关、国检、边检等部门信息互换、执法互助合作。完善信用考评制度，建立“互联网+”信用监管模式。开展智慧港口和智慧航道国际交流，推动我国相关技术和标准“走出去”。开展智慧港口国际对标评估，统筹做好与国际标准的有效衔接，推进国际交流合作。 （本文来源：经济日报 作者：陈双泉 郑嘉禹）",2025-04-17T01:34:52.036+03:00,https://static.jingjiribao.cn/static/jjrbrss/rsshtml/20250417/581342.html,,positive
全民國家安全教育日2025/參訪京滬歸來港生對國安增使命感,"4月15日是全民國家安全教育日，香港特區維護國家安全委員會舉辦了「全民國家安全教育日」開幕典禮暨主題講座。42名參加了第二屆「國家安全教育參訪團」的本港中小學生，以前往北京及上海參訪交流的經歷為背景，表演了舞台情景短劇《學子心 祖國情》。
六名參演學生接受大公報記者訪問，分享參訪團所見所感，以及台前幕後的趣事，表達了香港年輕一代對國家發展的正面認知和主動維護國家安全的堅定決心。\大公報記者 陸九如（文） 麥潤田（圖） 融媒組（視頻）
「參加國家安全參訪團令我對國家近代史產生了更全面的認識。」就讀港島民生書院的陳卓謙表示，赴內地學習的行程涵蓋很多地方，以往從沒經歷過。他參加了國安宣講會，還看到天安門廣場升旗儀式。陳卓謙在中國共產黨歷史展覽館看到許多傳奇人物的事跡，讓他了解到新中國成立時，千千萬萬先輩所作出的努力和犧牲，「這樣的精神值得香港年輕人學習。」作為首次參演短劇的同學，陳卓謙指開闊了視野，未來會從自己做起，並將體驗和經驗分享給同學，幫助大家培養國家安全的意識和國民身份認同。
敬仰錢學森無私奉獻精神
就讀福建中學高二年級的胡聞韜十分珍惜去人民大會堂參觀，在觀禮台上看升旗儀式的寶貴經驗。「我認為黨史館將歷史的厚重感和現代的科技感完美結合，通過多媒體互動，將黨和國家的發展脈絡呈現給同學們。」胡聞韜在短劇中飾演錢學森一角。被問到如何呈現「中國航天之父」這一重要角色時，他表示通過了解錢學森生平，觀看紀錄片和媒體介紹等，深入理解錢學森排除萬難，毅然決然回國發展航天事業的心路歷程。「錢老的事跡完美體現了熱愛祖國、無私奉獻的兩彈一星精神。」胡聞韜還指，錢學森曾說：「外國人可以做的，怎麼中國人就不行。」這讓他明白只要下定決心，毅然走下去，就一定會成功。
瑪利諾修院學校（中學部）許雅妍分享，行程中觀看升旗禮，清楚地看到三軍儀仗隊的英姿，看到全場莊嚴肅立唱國歌，一股愛國情懷油然而生。「我覺得自己對國家安全肩負了更大的使命。」許雅妍說，她在參訪團後還報名參加青年國安大使的培訓計劃，「希望有機會去做國安展覽館的義務導賞員。」許雅妍透露，參訪團後對基本法、憲法、國家安全法等法律產生濃厚興趣，希望未來能成為一名律師。「台上一分鐘，台下十年功。」許雅妍分享說，本次短劇表演提高團隊凝聚力、自信心和溝通能力。
朱晁陞就讀於聖公會李兆強小學，首次到訪北京，首都的繁華留下非常深刻印象。在行程中，他最難忘參觀清華大學，「那裏的大哥哥大姐姐都很厲害，而且很謙虛」，令他萌生日後去該校讀書的想法。他亦對國家航天發展很感興趣，希望日後從事守護國家安全、回饋社會的職業。他說，許多同學首次參加話劇，綵排過程中發生很多趣事，「這是大家值得一起學習的寶貴經驗。」
現今安穩生活 先輩用生命鑄造
就讀於順德聯誼總會胡少渠紀念小學的邵梓謙，在劇中飾演與小紅軍對話的小學生，他認為現今人們安穩生活是先輩們用自己的生命鑄造的，所以更應該珍惜。此次參訪團令他印象最深刻的是參觀中關村第三小學的校園，以及和當地的同學進行交流。
在劇中飾演其中一位小紅軍的是來自中華傳道會安柱中學的張浩榮，他告訴記者，平時比較開朗，但扮演小紅軍需保持嚴肅。「紅軍長征是中國共產黨歷史上一項偉大的壯舉，他們為人民的幸福不惜自我犧牲的精神令人動容。」他過往認為，只要國家不被侵犯，自身利益無損，就算國家安全。但在參訪團結束後，他知道國家安全包括許多範疇，與人民生活息息相關，國家的穩定需要共同維護。張浩榮說，參觀航天城讓他了解到國家最新的科技發展，認識到包括導航系統、國防在內的航天科技是國家安全的重要組成部分，他認為新時代的年輕人，應積極為祖國的科技事業貢獻力量。",2025-04-17T00:05:15.862+03:00,https://epaper.tkww.hk/a/202504/17/AP68001175e4b0fbda9a1e8d77.html,大文電子報用戶,positive
四川14项引领性改革加速推进_手机新浪网,"四川14项引领性改革加速推进
- 本报讯（四川日报全媒体记者尹梦奇）4月16日，记者从省委改革办获悉，省委十二届六次全会部署的14项引领性改革目前已取得阶段性成效。四川将加速推进相关任务落地落实，确保各领域都能形成一批标志性改革成果。
为推动省委十二届六次全会部署改革任务取得标志性成果，2024年10月省委改革办印发通知，明确了推动国有企业战略性重组和专业化整合、优化民营经济发展环境“五个专项治理”等14项引领性改革任务，由省领导牵头主抓和协调推进。

中柬友谊是合作共赢典范,"近年来，中国与柬埔寨在两国领导人的战略引领下，建立了牢不可破的“铁杆友谊”。双方在“钻石六边”架构下的务实合作不断深化，“工业发展走廊”和“鱼米走廊”建设持续推进，各领域合作成果丰硕，为两国人民带来了切实利益，成为“合作共赢、共同繁荣”的典范。习近平主席即将对柬埔寨进行国事访问，访问期间，双方将探讨提升中柬关系新定位，就政治互信、互利合作、安全保障、人文交流、战略协作五大领域深入交换意见。相信此次访问将进一步提升中柬两国的战略互信，推动两国各领域全方位的深入合作，为构建高质量、高水平、高标准的新时代中柬命运共同体注入强劲动力。
柬埔寨皇家科学院国际关系研究所所长金平近日在接受经济日报专访时表示，柬中两国传统友谊源远流长，最早可追溯到13世纪。自1958年7月19日两国建交以来，在历代领导人的精心呵护下，柬中友好合作关系经受住了历史的考验。2010年，两国建立全面战略合作伙伴关系。2019年，中国和柬埔寨签署《构建中柬命运共同体行动计划》（2019—2023），柬埔寨成为首个同中国签署构建命运共同体行动计划的国家。2020年，中国与柬埔寨正式签署自由贸易协定，并于2022年正式生效。2023年，双方达成“钻石六边”合作架构协议，签署了《构建新时代中柬命运共同体行动计划（2024—2028）》。这一系列的制度化安排，大大增强了两国关系的韧性和稳定性，为今后的合作拓展了更广阔的空间。
经贸合作已成为两国关系的基石。中国连续多年是柬埔寨最大外资来源国和最大贸易伙伴。中柬自贸协定显著加大了柬农产品和制成品的市场准入，有力促进了双边贸易增长。根据柬埔寨海关总署发布的统计数据，2024年，中柬贸易额达到151亿美元，同比增长23.8%。其中，柬对华出口额达17.5亿美元，同比增长18%；柬自中国进口额达134.3亿美元，同比增长24.6%。2024年在柬埔寨批准的国内外投资项目中，中国投资占到协议总投资额的49.8%。
与此同时，共建“一带一路”倡议也为柬基础设施、能源建设和数字经济发展等作出显著贡献。中柬共建的柬埔寨西哈努克港经济特区已吸引200多家国际企业和机构入驻，创造了3.2万个就业岗位；中企建设运营的柬埔寨首条高速公路——金边至西哈努克港高速公路，将两地通行时间从5小时以上缩短至不到2小时；暹粒吴哥国际机场助力旅游业快速增长，截至去年年底，已开通至8个国家的17条航线。共建“一带一路”框架下的重点项目以及“工业发展走廊”“鱼米走廊”建设对柬经济社会发展起到了重要作用。
双方将“钻石六边”合作与柬“五角战略”对接，在深化经贸合作基础上，不断扩大在教育、文化、旅游、扶贫、医疗援助及军事和安全等领域的合作，两国党际交流、官方和民间团体交流频繁，两国的务实合作有力促进了中柬民心相通。可以说，在柬埔寨的发展之路上，处处可见“中国印记”，这种双边合作的广度和深度，在柬埔寨对外关系史上前所未有，堪称发展中国家之间合作共赢的典范。
中柬两国一贯倡导多边主义、国际关系民主化，共同致力于建立更加公平的国际秩序，坚定维护国际规则和公平正义，反对霸权主义、强权政治，反对单边主义和贸易保护主义。面对变乱交织的国际局势，中国提出了构建周边命运共同体的倡议，作为友好邻邦，柬埔寨各界对此表示欢迎。两国有望进一步深化双边合作，共同维护以世界贸易组织为核心的多边贸易体制，在实现全球治理改革的共同承诺中加强战略合作，共同应对全球性挑战。（本文来源：经济日报 作者：王 涛）",2025-04-17T01:34:58.880+03:00,https://static.jingjiribao.cn/static/jjrbrss/rsshtml/20250417/581337.html,,positive
Washington state bill requiring clergy to report child abuse heads to governor's desk,"(OSV News) — Legislation that would require clergy to report child abuse or neglect in Washington state was recently approved by the Legislature and has been sent to Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson for his signature.
Some have expressed concern that without exceptions for clergy-penitent privilege, the bill could place Catholic priests at odds with civil law in order to uphold church law regarding the seal of the confessional.
No confession exception
Senate Bill 5375, sponsored by Democratic Sen. Noel Frame of Seattle seeks to make members of the clergy mandatory reporters, or people required by law to report suspected or known instances of child abuse or neglect, without an exception to the requirement for sacramental confessions.
In a February statement about her bill to make clergy mandatory reporters, Frame said, “It’s long past time that the Legislature steps up, closes this loophole, and protects children.”
“I know this is a tough subject for many of my colleagues, especially those with deep religious views,” she said. “I respect that, but this bill is about the separation of church and state. This bill is about the state’s secular responsibility to the public interest of protecting children. That’s the most important thing we do here.”
Ferguson’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment from OSV News about his plans for the legislation.
Similar bills failed in the Legislature in the two previous years after lawmakers could not reach consensus on the exception.
Washington State Catholic Conference opposition
The Washington State Catholic Conference opposed the particular version of the legislation that was passed, urging its supporters to tell their lawmakers to reject it “unless it is amended to provide a narrow exception for confidential communications between a member of the clergy and a penitent person of faith.”
“The majority of states that include clergy as mandatory reporters include an exemption for confidential communications, demonstrating that the states’ interests in child protection can be achieved without violating the right to free exercise of religion,” the conference said in its advocacy bulletin.
The conference, which is the public policy arm of the state’s Catholic bishops, has stated it would support such legislation with an exemption for the sacrament of confession.
Most states that specifically include clergy in their mandatory reporting laws provide some clergy-penitent privileges to varying degrees, according to data from the Child Welfare Information Gateway, which operates under the Children’s Bureau at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
The Catechism of the Catholic Church states that priests are strictly forbidden from divulging what penitents tell them during confession, which is part of the sacrament of reconciliation, and states that information a penitent divulges is under “seal.”
“Given the delicacy and greatness of this ministry and the respect due to persons, the Church declares that every priest who hears confessions is bound under very severe penalties to keep absolute secrecy regarding the sins that his penitents have confessed to him,” the catechism states.

我国经济起步稳开局好 一季度国内生产总值同比增长5.4%,"2025年中国经济“首季报”发布。国家统计局数据显示，初步核算，一季度国内生产总值318758亿元，按不变价格计算，同比增长5.4%，比上年四季度环比增长1.2%。
国家统计局副局长盛来运表示，今年以来，国际环境变乱交织，国内结构调整阵痛仍在释放。面对复杂局面，在以习近平同志为核心的党中央坚强领导下，各地区、各部门认真贯彻落实中央经济工作会议精神和《政府工作报告》部署，团结一心、奋发有为，加快落实积极有为的宏观政策，有力有效应对外部挑战。一季度，国民经济起步平稳、开局良好，高质量发展向新向好。
经济运行稳中回升
从主要宏观指标看，一季度经济延续了稳中向好、稳中回升的态势。
增长稳中有升。一季度5.4%的增速，高于去年全年5%的增速，也高于去年一季度5.3%的增速，在全球主要经济体中名列前茅。生产需求指标加快回升，全部工业增加值增长6.3%，比去年全年回升0.6个百分点；服务业增加值增长5.3%，回升0.3个百分点；固定资产投资增长4.2%，比去年全年回升1个百分点；社会消费品零售总额增长4.6%，回升1.1个百分点。
中国民生银行首席经济学家温彬认为，以旧换新政策持续拉动耐用品消费，设备更新政策推动工器具购置增速创新高，政府债加快发行托底基建投资，一系列稳房地产政策推动市场出现“小阳春”，这些都凸显出政策的积极效果。
就业收入总体稳定。一季度，全国城镇调查失业率平均值为5.3%，3月份失业率为5.2%。全国居民人均可支配收入扣除物价因素，实际增长5.6%，与GDP增长基本同步。
国际收支状况良好。一季度，全球经济增长动能偏弱，但我国进出口保持基本平稳的态势，货物贸易进出口总额同比增长1.3%，出口增长6.9%；3月末，外汇储备余额保持在3.2万亿美元以上。
3月份，制造业采购经理指数为50.5%，连续两个月回升。一季度，货运量同比加快；3月末，人民币贷款余额同比增长7.4%，社会融资规模存量增长8.4%，有力有效支撑了经济增长回升向好。
高质量发展向新向好
盛来运表示，一季度，新质生产力加快培育壮大，高质量发展继续取得新成效。
创新发展持续推进。各地加大对创新的支持力度，带动高技术产业发展。一季度，规模以上高技术制造业增加值同比增长9.7%，信息传输、软件和信息技术服务业增加值增长10.3%。
协调发展持续改善。从需求结构看，高技术产业投资比重在提升。一季度，高技术产业投资同比增长6.5%，占全部投资的比重为10.3%，提高0.3个百分点。
绿色发展扎实推进。以新能源车、锂电池、光伏为代表的新能源产业继续保持较高增长速度。一季度，非化石能源消费占能源消费总量的比重比上年同期提升1.5个百分点，高质量发展的绿色底色更加亮丽。
民生改善和安全发展继续取得新进展。对民生方面的支出占比持续提高，能源保供有力有效，化解地方债、中小金融机构、房地产等风险的政策积极有效，安全发展得到加强。
有信心有能力应对外部挑战
当前外部环境更趋复杂严峻，全球贸易保护主义快速升温，世界经济秩序受到重创。专家表示，中国经济基础稳、优势多、韧性强、潜力大，我们有底气、有信心、有能力应对外部挑战，实现既定发展目标。
经济有基础，内需有支撑。我国是世界第二大经济体，连续15年稳居全球制造业第一大国，产业体系完整、配套能力强，经济发展底盘稳、基础牢。我国有14亿多人口，人均GDP超过1.3万美元，正处在消费升级的关键阶段，无论是投资还是消费空间都非常大，将支撑中国经济持续发展。
市场多元化，出口有韧性。今年一季度，我国对共建“一带一路”沿线国家的出口同比增长7.2%，货物进出口额占全部进出口额比重超过50%，多元化市场格局正在形成。这也意味着我们对某一个国家单一出口市场的依存度下降。
转型有成效，新动能增强。过去5年，内需对经济增长的平均贡献率超过80%。去年“三新”经济增加值占GDP比重达到18%左右，新动能不断成长，有利于增强中国经济的协调性和稳定性。
应对有经验，政策有保障。盛来运表示，针对当前的外部变化，中央经济工作会议进行充分预判，宏观政策更加积极有为，及时推出更加积极的财政政策和适度宽松的货币政策。从一季度来看，政策效应持续显现，对推动国民经济实现良好开局发挥了重要作用。（经济日报记者 熊 丽）",2025-04-17T01:34:59.234+03:00,https://static.jingjiribao.cn/static/jjrbrss/rsshtml/20250417/581336.html,,positive
"Gayle King criticizes 'sexist' remarks about Blue Origin flight, highlights scientific contributions - The Mirror US","Gayle King has hit back at critics who dismissively referred to her recent Blue Origin flight as a ""space ride,"" labeling the term ""sexist.""
The esteemed 70-year-old broadcaster was in good company with celebrities like Katy Perry, Jeff Bezos's fiancée Lauren Sanchez, ex-NASA rocket scientist Aisha Bowe, civil rights advocate Amanda Nguyen, and film producer Kerianne Flynn for the brief but momentous 11-minute trip. The all-female crew triumphantly completed their journey to the Kármán line – the universally accepted edge of space - and returned from a secluded Texas ranch on Monday morning aboard Jeff Bezos's rocket.
They experienced three minutes of weightlessness before their descent back to Earth. In a post-flight interview, Gayle expressed frustration over the trivializing language used to describe their expedition, stating, ""They call it a ride, which I find very irritating because they never say men went for a ride.""
Addressing skepticism about the scientific merit of their voyage, Gayle, alongside Aisha Bowe, discussed the broader implications of space exploration on CBS Mornings on Tuesday. ""There's so many things that have been developed in space that benefit Earth...from pharmaceuticals to, like, research on agriculture,"" Aisha highlighted, reports the Mirror.
""And, you know, I paused there because we did research and it was emotional...part of what I accomplished in my flight was I was looking at the future of being able to produce crops that can withstand harsh environments so we can look at food security here on Earth, and simultaneously, we also were able to certify that device so more people could do research on New Shepard,"" she continued.
Gayle previously criticized those who referred to the flight as a ""ride,"" arguing that no one would ever say to a [male] astronaut, ""'What a ride.' [Don't] call it a ride.""
She further clarified, ""It's called a flight or a journey. A ride implies it's something frivolous or lighthearted. There's nothing frivolous about what we did.""
This follows Lauren Sanchez, Jeff Bezos' soon-to-be wife, expressing her hopes in a video post that the mission would inspire others to ""dream big."" She admitted, ""If someone would have told me that I would be able to go to space one day, I would have definitely, well, I don't know, laughed.""
""I can't believe it's happening. My dad used to teach people how to fly, and I used to hang around the hanger and I thought dreaming of becoming a pilot was a huge deal, and this is even bigger.
""The incredible women that are going on this flight are extraordinary in all of their fields, but more importantly, they're incredible storytellers,"" she continued, ""So what I'm hoping for is, this flight is not just transformative for them, but also for all of the people that they tell their story to. Hopefully it sparks that imagination to a dream big and reach for the stars.""

Lawmakers look to make prosecuting child predators easier - NewsBreak,"Sen. Blaise Ingoglia. (Photo by Christine Sexton/Florida Phoenix) End-to-end encryption has made crimes against minors significantly harder to prosecute, legal experts say. Florida lawmakers plan to make social media companies cooperate with those investigations. The Sen. Blaise Ingoglia-introduced SB 868 is headed to the Senate floor after passing the Rules Committee Wednesday. Social media companies offering encrypted messaging are in opposition to the bill while state attorneys came to Tallahassee hoping the Legislature would make their jobs easier. Encrypted messages, those designed only to be read by the sender and receiver, not the owners of the platform it was sent on, are designed to prevent hackers or others acting in bad faith from accessing personal messages. Since end-to-end encryption has become widely-used, Ingoglia said, social media companies have told prosecutors they have no records to provide toward convicting “nefarious” actors in child pornography and drug trafficking cases. “As you know, there are extremely bad actors online targeting minors with sexually explicit and sexually suggestive materials,” Ingoglia said. “Encryption, used by social media companies, makes it more challenging if not impossible for law enforcement to retrieve the proof necessary to put these guys behind bars.” The bill would require social media companies to de-crypt messages if subpoenaed by a court and prohibit minors from using messages that are designed to disappear. Popular apps like Snapchat, Instagram, and Facebook Messenger offer end-to-end encryption. NetChoice, a tech association representing some of the largest social platforms, contest the bill, saying it is “well intentioned” but “fundamentally undermines the core purpose of encryption.” “Creating an encryption backdoor is fraught with privacy and security risks,” NetChoice stated on its website. Rep. Michelle Salzman is sponsor of the House version, HB 743 , which must pass the Commerce Committee before receiving a floor vote. “I shared with all the social media companies that came to see me that we are going to put the safety of Floridians first and them second, and either they can get on board and look good or they can just stand there and fight and lose,” Salzman told reporters Wednesday afternoon. “We’re not going to stop here. This bill will pass this year and we’re going to continue the momentum.” This bill is another in lawmakers’ effort to protect minors online. Minors younger than 14-years-old will be prohibited from using social media if the state successfully defends its 2024 law that also requires parental consent for 14-and-15-year-olds to use social media platforms with addictive features. NetChoice filed suit against the state on that 2024 law, HB 3. “So, just think if you were a parent, and you know that your child is being groomed by somebody online, and the child is now being pressured to give nude photos or create child pornography for the purpose of transmitting over,” Ingoglia said. “And you went to a state’s attorney or a prosecutor and they tried and they gave the subpoena or the warrant and the social media came back and they said, ‘Hey we have nothing.’” Ingoglia said he does not think social media companies are behaving in good faith. “Under any other section of law when it comes to prosecuting, somebody who destroys evidence will be put away,” Ingoglia said. “But social media companies though their algorithms and through their coding are allowed to destroy evidence all the time.” State Attorney Amira Fox, prosecuting in Charlotte, Collier, Glades, Hendry, and Lee counties, stood beside Salzman and Ingoglia Wednesday in hopes the bill will pass. “Social media platforms have made it very difficult for prosecutors,” Fox said, adding that end-to-end encryption has attracted people who want to use it for illegal purposes. Fox said compared to the beginning of her career, social media have boosted the number of cases involving child predators. “We have spent years putting together task forces to tackle human trafficking and child abuse, and now we’re met with, when we send our subpoenas and our search warrants to these social media companies … we get back ‘no material exists,’ because they’ve encrypted it,” Fox said during a news conference Wednseday afternoon at the Capitol. Fox said the lawmakers’ bill is a “great bill to stand up to this.” SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE",2025-04-17T00:36:00.000+03:00,https://www.newsbreak.com/florida-phoenix-563741/3965872110786-lawmakers-look-to-make-prosecuting-child-predators-easier,Jay Waagmeester,positive
中国经济开门红 应对外部挑战有底气,"中国经济开门红 应对外部挑战有底气
2025年一季度，中国经济实现开门红。
“国民经济实现良好开局，高质量发展向新向好。”在国新办4月16日举行的新闻发布会上，国家统计局副局长盛来运介绍，初步核算，一季度国内生产总值（GDP）318758亿元，按不变价格计算，同比增长5.4%，比上年四季度环比增长1.2%。
在全球主要经济体中名列前茅
“增长”一词在这场发布会上频频出现。工业被喻为国民经济的“压舱石”。一季度，我国工业生产增长加快，全国规模以上工业增加值同比增长6.5%，比去年全年加快0.7个百分点。
3月份，全国规模以上工业增加值同比增长7.7%。中泰证券研究所政策组首席分析师杨畅注意到，在去年工业生产基数较高的情况下，今年3月仍然实现了较高增速，表明我国工业生产仍然很强。
消费、投资、出口被视为拉动经济增长的“三驾马车”，其中，消费是拉动经济增长的“主引擎”。民生银行首席经济学家温彬认为，我国经济开年运行平稳，尽管外需有所放缓，但政策发力对内需形成提振。
一季度，消费在政策的推动下持续改善。社会消费品零售总额为124671亿元，同比增长4.6%，比上年全年加快1.1个百分点。
在投资方面，一季度，全国固定资产投资（不含农户）103174亿元，同比增长4.2%，比上年全年加快1个百分点。扣除房地产开发投资，全国固定资产投资增长8.3%。
盛来运指出，前期出台的宏观政策和今年以来扩容加码的增量政策叠加发力，有效扩大了需求、促进了生产、激发了活力、增强了信心。3月份，制造业采购经理人指数是50.5%，环比上升了0.3个百分点，连续两个月回升。
一系列政策举措为民营企业投资创造公平的营商环境，民间投资由上年全年下降转为增长。民营企业的活力动力不断显现，一季度制造业中的民间投资同比增长9.7%，基础设施投资中的民间投资增长9.3%，均比各自领域的平均增速快。
此外，盛来运表示，一季度GDP同比增长5.4%，增速高于去年全国5%的增速，也高于去年一季度5.3%的增速，还高于不少全球主要经济体一季度的经济增速，在全球主要经济体中名列前茅。在全球经济增长乏力的情况下，中国将为世界经济的稳定发挥重要作用。
高质量发展持续向新向好
一季度，中国经济在实现“量”的合理增长的同时，新质生产力也在培育壮大，高质量发展向新向好的大势没有改变。
5个维度反映出这一趋势。盛来运介绍，第一个维度是创新持续推进，新质生产力培育壮大。第二个维度是协调发展持续改善。第三个维度是高水平开放继续推进。第四个维度是绿色转型、绿色发展扎实推进。第五个维度是民生改善和安全发展继续取得新进展。
一季度，各地方加大对创新的支持力度，尤其是人工智能、量子科技等一批先进技术不断推出和应用，带动了高技术产业发展。DeepSeek、宇树人形机器人等一批成果的应用，既彰显了中国科技创新的实力，同时也增强了市场的信心。
新兴产业正在蓬勃发展。一季度，新能源汽车、3D打印设备、工业机器人产品产量同比分别增长45.4%、44.9%、26.0%。
盛来运指出，一季度，规模以上高技术制造业增加值同比增长9.7%，信息传输、软件和信息技术服务业增加值增长10.3%，这两个数据也显示出我国创新动力在增强。
工业向高端化、智能化、绿色化转型的趋势明显。从需求结构来看，当下我国投资增速实际上不高，但是高技术产业投资比重是在提升的。一季度，高技术产业投资同比增长6.5%，占全部投资的比重为10.3%，提高0.3个百分点。
民生改善和安全发展继续取得新进展。政府高度重视加大民生方面的支出，对民生方面的支出占比持续提高。能源保供有力有效，一季度就业形势总体稳定，城镇调查失业率稳中略降。一季度末，外出务工农村劳动力总量18795万人，同比增长1.1%。
此外，全国城镇调查失业率平均值为5.3%。居民收入增长与经济增长基本同步。一季度，全国居民人均可支配收入12179元，同比名义增长5.5%，扣除价格因素实际增长5.6%。
安全发展得到加强。作为防风险的重点领域，房地产行业也出现了不少积极变化。1-3月，全国新建商品房销售面积21869万平方米，同比下降3.0%，降幅比1-2月收窄2.1个百分点；新建商品房销售额20798亿元，下降2.1%，降幅收窄0.5个百分点。
“房地产止跌回稳的态势明显。”广东省城规院住房政策研究中心首席研究员李宇嘉说，一季度，房地产行业从上游开工到下游销售，相关的跌幅明显收窄。
有底气、有信心、有能力应对外部挑战
近期，美国“对等关税”风波愈演愈烈。面对冲击，我国外贸韧性依然强劲。今年一季度，我国货物贸易进出口10.3万亿元，同比增长1.3%。其中，出口6.13万亿元，增长6.9%。
“我们坚决反对美国搞关税壁垒和贸易霸凌，这种做法损人不利己，违背了经济规律和世界贸易的原则，对世界经济秩序造成严重冲击，拖累世界经济复苏。”盛来运表示，中方坚决采取一系列反制措施，不仅是维护自身发展利益的需要，也是维护世界多边贸易体系和世贸组织规则的正当之举。
谈及加征高额关税对中国的影响，盛来运说：“从短期来看，美国加征高额关税会对我国经济和外贸带来一定压力，但是改变不了中国经济持续长期向好的大势。中国经济基础稳、优势多、韧性强、潜力大，我们有底气、有信心、有能力应对外部挑战，实现既定发展目标。”
盛来运说，中国经济有基础，内需有支撑。中国是世界第二大经济体，连续15年稳居第一制造业大国的地位，产业体系完整、配套能力强，经济发展底盘稳、基础牢。同时，中国有14亿多人口，市场规模巨大，人均GDP超过1.3万美元，正处在消费升级的关键阶段，市场成长性好，无论是投资还是消费空间都非常大，将支撑中国经济持续发展。他指出，我国依靠内需和创新驱动共同推动经济增长的新格局正在形成。
目前，我国已成为150多个国家和地区的重要贸易伙伴，外贸多元化市场格局正在形成，这意味着我国对某一个国家单一出口市场的依存度在下降。盛来运举例，2018年，我国对美国的出口额占出口总额的比重是19.2%，去年已经下降到14.7%。
针对当前的外部变化，我国应对有经验，并且政策有保障。盛来运谈到，当下，一揽子政策正在发力显效，“下阶段会根据外部形势的变化及时推出增量政策，丰富的政策‘工具箱’是应对外部的冲击和挑战的保障”。
此外，中国的企业家敢闯敢拼，中国人民智慧勤劳，都是我国应对巨大风险挑战的基础和底气。“我们对中国经济后期的走势以及发展的前景充满信心。”盛来运说。",2025-04-17T01:35:18.798+03:00,http://news.cyol.com/gb/articles/2025-04/17/content_NV5J6jT8WV.html,"李立红,陈鼎",positive

"APA, NCPA Cheer First-Of-Its-Kind State Law Banning PBMs from Owning Pharmacies | Morningstar","Alexandria, Va., April 16, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- In a significant victory for patients and community pharmacies in Arkansas, Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders signed HB 1150 into law today. This is groundbreaking legislation that prohibits state permits to pharmacies owned by pharmacy benefit managers effective Jan. 1, 2026. The National Community Pharmacists Association, which represents the country’s independent pharmacies, supported the Arkansas Pharmacists Association’s leadership on HB 1150 as it moved through the legislative process.
APA is the voice of Arkansas pharmacists and has worked hard to advance HB 1150 and other PBM reform efforts. NCPA, which represents the country’s independent community pharmacies, has also persistently advocated that state and federal policymakers rein in the conflicts of interest and anticompetitive business practices that arise with PBMs vertically integrated upstream with health insurers and downstream with pharmacies. These practices include contract terms that restrict competitors’ access to patients, massive clawbacks, steering patients away from competing community pharmacies, below-cost reimbursements, and punitive audit practices. Prohibiting PBM ownership of pharmacies via HB 1150 would put an end to these tactics and promote Arkansans’ access to quality pharmacy care.
“Today is a new day in Arkansas for our patients as the fox will no longer guard the henhouse,” said John Vinson, APA’s chief executive officer. “This bipartisan legislation passed overwhelmingly to protect public health and safety for Arkansans. HB 1150 will stop the abusive self-dealing at PBM affiliated pharmacies that raises prescription drug prices and limits patient access. The pharmacists of Arkansas are very grateful for a courageous legislature and Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders. We also thank Attorney General Tim Griffin for his support.”
“Time and time again, PBMs have proven themselves to be resistant to transparency and reform,” said Anne Cassity, NCPA’s senior vice president of government affairs. “HB 1150 is a structural change that gets to the heart of the problem – the conflicts of interest inherent in vertical integration that PBMs have been manipulating to the detriment of patients, taxpayers, and pharmacies. We applaud HB 1150 and are eager to see its provisions implemented in Arkansas and, ideally, throughout the country.""
Since the introduction of HB 1150, similar ownership provisions were introduced or amended into bills in Indiana, New York, Texas, and Vermont. Additionally, on April 14, a bipartisan coalition of 39 state and territory attorneys general sent a letter to congressional leaders urging them to pass legislation prohibiting PBMs from owning or operating pharmacies. A bill to do so was introduced late last year by Sens. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Reps. Diana Harshbarger (R-Tenn.) – who wrote a letter in support of Arkansas HB 1150 – and Jake Auchincloss (D-Mass.).

Mr. Ken Lapierre reports ROCKY SHORE DISCOVERS LARGE GOLD TA,"Mr. Ken Lapierre reports
ROCKY SHORE DISCOVERS LARGE GOLD TARGET OVER THE APPLETON FAULT CORRIDOR
Rocky Shore Gold Ltd.'s initial prospecting and surface sampling program at its 100-per-cent-owned, district-scale Gold Anchor project, located in Newfoundland, has identified a highly prospective 6.0-kilometre-long gold target termed the Lane Pond gold target. The target is located above the Appleton fault corridor; a known gold-bearing fault on the adjoining Queensway project controlled by New Found Gold Corp. Additional gold-bearing targets have also been identified proximal to the JBP fault corridor and the newly discovered North and South fault corridors. The company now controls more than 20 kilometres of the Appleton fault corridor, more than 50 kilometres of the JBP fault corridor and prospective additional major underexplored faults. The Appleton fault corridor and the JBP fault corridor are known to host significant gold discoveries and gold deposits northeast of the Gold Anchor project in central Newfoundland.
Ken Lapierre, president and chief executive officer of Rocky Shore, commented: ""This is an exciting time to be shareholders of Rocky Shore Gold. The Gold Anchor project, part of a promising gold district, continues to yield excellent results. Despite limited exploration on less than 10 per cent of the project, we've identified numerous high-priority areas, including the 6.0-kilometre-long Lane Pond gold target along the Appleton fault corridor, known for major gold deposits. This spring, we'll conduct surface geophysics and basal till sampling at Lane Pond to prioritize areas for our first ever diamond drill core program. Additionally, we look forward to expanding our reconnaissance program of soil/till sampling and boots on the ground prospecting over prospective gold target areas identified to date once winter breakup is complete.""
2024-2025 updated exploration summary highlights:
Gold-bearing structures identified: known major faults identified trending southwest onto the Gold Anchor project, including the Dog Bay line fault, the gold-bearing Appleton and JBP fault corridors and the Grub line fault; Additional faults identified: preliminary studies identify the newly discovered North and South fault corridors; both faults are located between the gold-bearing Appleton and JBP fault corridors; Lane Pond gold target identified: the 6.0-kilometre-long Lane Pond gold target discovered along trend to the southwest of the known gold-bearing Appleton fault corridor; the Appleton fault hosts significant gold discoveries and gold deposits on the adjoining ground; values from soil, till and historic till and float samples at Lane Pond ranged from 0.005 gram per tonne gold up to 8.7 g/t gold; future planned exploration will include a diamond drill program in the summer of 2025; Additional gold target areas identified: seven additional gold target areas were discovered along the JBP, North and South fault corridors and the Grub line fault; follow-up surface work planned for the summer of 2025.

Saudi Arabia and France Strengthen Health Cooperation Through Strategic Agreements in Biotech and Digital Health | finanzen.net,"Home Aktien Saudi Arabia and France Strengthen Health Cooperation Through Strategic Agreements in Biotech and Digital Health Saudi Arabia and France Strengthen Health Cooperation Through Strategic Agreements in Biotech and Digital Health 17.04.25 00:10 Uhr Werbung PARIS , April 16, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- On the second day of an official visit to France , His Excellency Fahad Abdulrahman AlJalajel, Minister of Health of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia , held bilateral meetings with senior French officials including Minister for Labour, Health, Solidarity and Families Catherine Vautrin, Minister for Health and Access to Care Yannick Neuder and Laurent Saint-Martin , Minister Delegate for Foreign Trade and French Nationals Abroad.

"'Se lograron grandes momentos con Ancelotti en Real Madrid, pero se acabó': Memo Schutz","Audio relacionado
El día de hoy el Real Madrid fue eliminado de la Champions League 2024/2025 por el Arsenal en los cuartos de final con un marcador global de 5-1.
Durante la emisión de este día de MVS Deportes, programa que se transmite de lunes a viernes entre 3 y 4 de la tarde por MVS Noticias, los conductores David Faitelson, Memo Schutz y Carlos Aguilar opinaron acerca de la eliminación del equipo merengue de la Champions League 2024/2025.
Paliza merengue en cuartos de final
“Como dirían por ahí, el hambre se junta con las ganas de comer. El Madrid, con muy pocos argumentos, lo ha hecho a lo largo de la temporada, no tiene la manera de resolver los partidos con una conjunción que sí muestran otros, otros equipos como el Barcelona o el Arsenal. Lo habían hecho por medio de sus individualidades”, afirmó Memo Schutz.

El periodista y conductor de MVS Deportes destacó la salida de Kylian Mbappé del partido por lesión, pues todavía tiene en puerta la final de la Copa del Rey frente al FC Barcelona y el cierre de LaLiga.
“Jugaron muy mal y se acabó una era, una era en donde en algún momento termina. Se acabó la era de Ancelotti, se lograron grandes momentos con Carletto Ancelotti, vaya, en las Champions que se ganaron, todos los títulos que se obtuvieron, pero ya no”, agregó Schutz.

Además, señaló que por alguna u otra razón ya no hay comunión entre el equipo y entre el entrenador italiano: “El mismo Ancelotti ha de estar cansado. Zidane se fue en algún momento cuando dijo ‘yo me voy en la parte más alta’. Es difícil saber cuándo retirarte o cuándo dar un paso al costado en cualquier cosa de la vida y en el deporte no es la excepción”.
Por último, Memo Schutz afirmó que Carletto Ancelotti y Luka Modric ya no van a estar más en el Real Madrid: “Qué lástima… El próximo técnico del Madrid sería Xavi Alonso, ya está arreglado”.",2025-04-17T01:08:00.000+03:00,https://mvsnoticias.com/deportes/2025/4/16/se-lograron-grandes-momentos-con-ancelotti-en-real-madrid-pero-se-acabo-memo-schutz-688124.html,Halim Hernández,positive
台州法院严厉打击恶意欠薪行为快立快审快执高效保障劳动者权益_法治新闻_法治频道_云南网,"原标题：台州法院严厉打击恶意欠薪行为快立快审快执高效保障劳动者权益
□ 本报记者 王 春
□ 本报通讯员 吕佳慧
近日，《法治日报》记者走进浙江省玉环市一汽配公司园区的会议室，员工们排着队，在玉环市人民法院执行干警张绍华等人的安排下，正有序办理工资申领手续。
“我的工资马上‘齐活’啦！”员工小刘高兴地告诉记者。
这是玉环市人民法院在去年年底受理的一起欠薪纠纷。玉环法院启动快审快执通道，不仅保障了多名员工的合法权益，也及时挽救了岌岌可危的汽配企业。
近年来，台州两级法院始终将保障劳动权益置于司法工作的重要位置。
台州市中级人民法院院长翟寅生向记者介绍称，去年以来，台州两级法院进一步深化机制改革、凝聚社会合力，严厉打击恶意欠薪行为，以“快立快审快执”机制为基础，构建起劳动者权益全链条保护体系，筑牢劳动者权益“防护墙”，为营造和谐有序的用工环境、优化法治化营商环境贡献法院力量。
开通维权绿色通道
2024年10月，台州中院会同台州市人力资源和社会保障局共同出台《关于加强调裁审执衔接推动农民工工资争议速办工作的通知》，在调裁审执各环节落实对农民工群体涉薪资权益的保护。
“没想到能在过节之前就要到了工资，太感谢法院了。效率真的非常高，我们可以拿这钱好好过个元旦了。”去年底，农民工老张看见工资到账的消息后，立刻打电话向仙居县人民法院承办法官戴天华“报喜”。
一施工项目经层层分包，由仙居县某建筑劳务公司承揽了部分劳务工程。老张受雇于这家建筑劳务公司，从事脚手架搭建和拆除等工作。但工程结束后，该劳务公司却以工资应由项目发包方某建设集团支付为由，拖欠农民工工资。
仙居法院立案庭接到老张等人的立案申请后，立刻开通农民工维权“绿色通道”，并由专人与业务庭进行对接，优先排期、优先审理，适用速裁程序进行审理，并由承办法官戴天华进行督促履行，及时高效保障了老张等农民工的合法权益。
仙居法院对农民工讨薪案件实行优先接待、优先立案、优先送达、优先调解，并安排专人负责引导，简化立案手续，提供优质高效的“一站式”服务，全力为劳动者撑起权益“保护伞”。
“涉农民工案件往往并不复杂，但是小案不小办，要办就办实。”仙居法院民一庭庭长吴勇智说。
开展集中执行行动
2025年伊始，台州中院在全市开展“执护营商——暖冬”集中执行行动，以拖欠工资案件为重点，聚焦各类涉民生案件和5万元以下小标的案件，集中解决一批群众急难愁盼问题。
该项行动中，全市法院执结拖欠工资案件426件，执行到位2375.35万元。
在台州市黄岩区，包工头胡某拖欠水泥工老闫1万余元工资款迟迟不付。1月9日清晨，黄岩区人民法院执行干警由老闫带路找到胡某，将其带往法院。到法院后，胡某在法官的引导下逐渐转变态度，称愿意积极凑钱付工资。最终，胡某凑齐所有执行款，案件履行完毕。
“感谢法院为我们主持公道，让我们这些外来务工人员也能感受到法律的温暖。”领到工资后的老闫十分感动。
同一时间，在温岭市人民法院的会议室里，职工工资执行案款集中发放活动正在开展。28名来自同一家4S店的员工在执行干警的引导下，签字确认工资金额、收款账户信息。
这家4S店因经营不善倒闭，员工被拖欠工资后陆续向温岭法院申请强制执行。执行干警先后联系了4S店原经理、经销商、汽车生产商，最终找到了一条200余万元款项的财产线索。在汽车生产商的配合下，温岭法院将该款项作为4S店的执行款划扣到位，28名员工也顺利地领到了属于他们的工资款。
多元化解劳动纠纷
近年来，台州两级法院在劳动纠纷领域积极探索工作新思路，多方协同推进劳动纠纷调裁诉的衔接配合，建立劳动纠纷多元化解机制，推动构建和谐劳动关系。
三门县人民法院主动融入党委、政府矛盾纠纷预防化解共建共治共享大格局，会同县总工会、县人社局搭建“一中心、一小组、一会议”的劳动纠纷调裁诉联合化解工作格局，向劳动纠纷调裁诉联合化解中心派驻法官，为职工群众提供“一窗受理、集中分流、分类处理、一揽子调处”的高质量、高效率调处服务。
日前，员工刘某因工伤与三门某工程公司产生纠纷，来到三门县劳动纠纷调裁诉联合化解中心求助。该中心受理后，在法官、调解员等多方力量的努力下，刘某与该公司达成和解。公司一次性赔偿刘某伤残就业补助金等各项损失合计4.5万元。
“多亏了他们帮忙，我才能拿到工伤赔偿。”刘某激动地说。（王 春 吕佳慧）",2025-04-17T01:36:20.697+03:00,http://fazhi.yunnan.cn/system/2025/04/17/033452239.shtml,"www.yunnan.cn,云南日报报业集团,云南网",positive
"Los aranceles ""recíprocos"" han recaudado 500 millones de dólares desde el 5 de abril","Los aranceles “recíprocos” han recaudado 500 millones de dólares desde el 5 de abril
Estados Unidos ha cosechado con todos los aranceles del país -no solo los nuevos gravámenes- 21.000 millones de dólares desde el 20 de enero de este año.
Los aranceles llamados “recíprocos” por el presidente estadounidense, Donald Trump, han recaudado desde el 5 de abril (cuando entraron en vigor) 500 millones de dólares, una cifra muy inferior a la estimada por el mandatario, de 2.000 millones de dólares diarios.
Un portavoz de la Oficina de A duanas y Protección Fronteriza de los Estados Unidos (CBP, en inglés), indicó a EFE en un correo electrónico que Estados Unidos ha cosechado con todos los aranceles del país -no solo los nuevos gravámenes- 21.000 millones de dólares desde el 20 de enero de este año.
En esta cifra se incluyen los 500 millones que, desde que entraron en vigor, han recaudado los aranceles denominados por la Administración Trump como “recíprocos”.
Según la CBP, el flujo de ingresos promedio del total de aranceles es de 250 millones de dolares al día.
La cifra ofrecida por la agencia contradice las palabras del líder republicano, que ha asegurado en numerosas ocasiones que EE.UU. está recaudando con sus nuevos aranceles unos 2.000 millones de dólares al día, un dato que, según él, probablemente llegue a subir en un futuro hasta los 3.500 millones de dólares al día.
La política arancelaria de Trump ha hecho tambalear los mercados y han sembrado el temor entre analistas y entidades financieras a una posible recesión; de hecho, JPMorgan Chase, el banco más grande del país, ha elevado las posibilidades de una recesión global del 40 % al 60 %.
El pasado miércoles 9 de abril, el mandatario dio marcha atrás con respecto a los aranceles “recíprocos” que anunció días antes y rebajó su ofensiva, dejando un arancel generalizado del 10 % para la mayoría de países y regiones, incluyendo la UE, durante un plazo de 90 días.
En contraposición, Trump incrementó sus aranceles a China hasta el 145%, aunque luego excluyó de estos últimos (de forma temporal) los teléfonos celulares y componentes de ordenadores.
Además, también están en vigor aranceles a sectores concretos como el automovilístico o el del acero y aluminio.

中国经济开门红 应对外部挑战有底气,"2025年一季度，中国经济实现开门红。
“国民经济实现良好开局，高质量发展向新向好。”在国新办4月16日举行的新闻发布会上，国家统计局副局长盛来运介绍，初步核算，一季度国内生产总值（GDP）318758亿元，按不变价格计算，同比增长5.4%，比上年四季度环比增长1.2%。
在全球主要经济体中名列前茅
“增长”一词在这场发布会上频频出现。工业被喻为国民经济的“压舱石”。一季度，我国工业生产增长加快，全国规模以上工业增加值同比增长6.5%，比去年全年加快0.7个百分点。
3月份，全国规模以上工业增加值同比增长7.7%。中泰证券研究所政策组首席分析师杨畅注意到，在去年工业生产基数较高的情况下，今年3月仍然实现了较高增速，表明我国工业生产仍然很强。
消费、投资、出口被视为拉动经济增长的“三驾马车”，其中，消费是拉动经济增长的“主引擎”。民生银行首席经济学家温彬认为，我国经济开年运行平稳，尽管外需有所放缓，但政策发力对内需形成提振。
一季度，消费在政策的推动下持续改善。社会消费品零售总额为124671亿元，同比增长4.6%，比上年全年加快1.1个百分点。
在投资方面，一季度，全国固定资产投资（不含农户）103174亿元，同比增长4.2%，比上年全年加快1个百分点。扣除房地产开发投资，全国固定资产投资增长8.3%。
盛来运指出，前期出台的宏观政策和今年以来扩容加码的增量政策叠加发力，有效扩大了需求、促进了生产、激发了活力、增强了信心。3月份，制造业采购经理人指数是50.5%，环比上升了0.3个百分点，连续两个月回升。
一系列政策举措为民营企业投资创造公平的营商环境，民间投资由上年全年下降转为增长。民营企业的活力动力不断显现，一季度制造业中的民间投资同比增长9.7%，基础设施投资中的民间投资增长9.3%，均比各自领域的平均增速快。
此外，盛来运表示，一季度GDP同比增长5.4%，增速高于去年全国5%的增速，也高于去年一季度5.3%的增速，还高于不少全球主要经济体一季度的经济增速，在全球主要经济体中名列前茅。在全球经济增长乏力的情况下，中国将为世界经济的稳定发挥重要作用。
高质量发展持续向新向好
一季度，中国经济在实现“量”的合理增长的同时，新质生产力也在培育壮大，高质量发展向新向好的大势没有改变。
5个维度反映出这一趋势。盛来运介绍，第一个维度是创新持续推进，新质生产力培育壮大。第二个维度是协调发展持续改善。第三个维度是高水平开放继续推进。第四个维度是绿色转型、绿色发展扎实推进。第五个维度是民生改善和安全发展继续取得新进展。
一季度，各地方加大对创新的支持力度，尤其是人工智能、量子科技等一批先进技术不断推出和应用，带动了高技术产业发展。DeepSeek、宇树人形机器人等一批成果的应用，既彰显了中国科技创新的实力，同时也增强了市场的信心。
新兴产业正在蓬勃发展。一季度，新能源汽车、3D打印设备、工业机器人产品产量同比分别增长45.4%、44.9%、26.0%。
盛来运指出，一季度，规模以上高技术制造业增加值同比增长9.7%，信息传输、软件和信息技术服务业增加值增长10.3%，这两个数据也显示出我国创新动力在增强。
工业向高端化、智能化、绿色化转型的趋势明显。从需求结构来看，当下我国投资增速实际上不高，但是高技术产业投资比重是在提升的。一季度，高技术产业投资同比增长6.5%，占全部投资的比重为10.3%，提高0.3个百分点。
民生改善和安全发展继续取得新进展。政府高度重视加大民生方面的支出，对民生方面的支出占比持续提高。能源保供有力有效，一季度就业形势总体稳定，城镇调查失业率稳中略降。一季度末，外出务工农村劳动力总量18795万人，同比增长1.1%。
此外，全国城镇调查失业率平均值为5.3%。居民收入增长与经济增长基本同步。一季度，全国居民人均可支配收入12179元，同比名义增长5.5%，扣除价格因素实际增长5.6%。
安全发展得到加强。作为防风险的重点领域，房地产行业也出现了不少积极变化。1-3月，全国新建商品房销售面积21869万平方米，同比下降3.0%，降幅比1-2月收窄2.1个百分点；新建商品房销售额20798亿元，下降2.1%，降幅收窄0.5个百分点。
“房地产止跌回稳的态势明显。”广东省城规院住房政策研究中心首席研究员李宇嘉说，一季度，房地产行业从上游开工到下游销售，相关的跌幅明显收窄。
有底气、有信心、有能力应对外部挑战
近期，美国“对等关税”风波愈演愈烈。面对冲击，我国外贸韧性依然强劲。今年一季度，我国货物贸易进出口10.3万亿元，同比增长1.3%。其中，出口6.13万亿元，增长6.9%。
“我们坚决反对美国搞关税壁垒和贸易霸凌，这种做法损人不利己，违背了经济规律和世界贸易的原则，对世界经济秩序造成严重冲击，拖累世界经济复苏。”盛来运表示，中方坚决采取一系列反制措施，不仅是维护自身发展利益的需要，也是维护世界多边贸易体系和世贸组织规则的正当之举。
谈及加征高额关税对中国的影响，盛来运说：“从短期来看，美国加征高额关税会对我国经济和外贸带来一定压力，但是改变不了中国经济持续长期向好的大势。中国经济基础稳、优势多、韧性强、潜力大，我们有底气、有信心、有能力应对外部挑战，实现既定发展目标。”
盛来运说，中国经济有基础，内需有支撑。中国是世界第二大经济体，连续15年稳居第一制造业大国的地位，产业体系完整、配套能力强，经济发展底盘稳、基础牢。同时，中国有14亿多人口，市场规模巨大，人均GDP超过1.3万美元，正处在消费升级的关键阶段，市场成长性好，无论是投资还是消费空间都非常大，将支撑中国经济持续发展。他指出，我国依靠内需和创新驱动共同推动经济增长的新格局正在形成。
目前，我国已成为150多个国家和地区的重要贸易伙伴，外贸多元化市场格局正在形成，这意味着我国对某一个国家单一出口市场的依存度在下降。盛来运举例，2018年，我国对美国的出口额占出口总额的比重是19.2%，去年已经下降到14.7%。
针对当前的外部变化，我国应对有经验，并且政策有保障。盛来运谈到，当下，一揽子政策正在发力显效，“下阶段会根据外部形势的变化及时推出增量政策，丰富的政策‘工具箱’是应对外部的冲击和挑战的保障”。
此外，中国的企业家敢闯敢拼，中国人民智慧勤劳，都是我国应对巨大风险挑战的基础和底气。“我们对中国经济后期的走势以及发展的前景充满信心。”盛来运说。",2025-04-17T01:36:27.319+03:00,http://m.cyol.com/gb/articles/2025-04/17/content_NV5J6jT8WV.html,"李立红,陈鼎",positive

Governor Pritzker announces $653m in Illinois 2024 production spend,"While cities like Atlanta, New York, Manitoba, New Orleans, and even the UK continue to siphon off large-scale productions from Hollywood, Illinois is proving it can compete—and win. Governor JB Pritzker today announced that film production expenditures in Illinois reached $653 million in 2024, the second-highest total in state history, generating an estimated $351 million in wages and 18,200 hires across the industry (excluding extras).
In the wake of Los Angeles’ first-quarter production numbers plunging more than 22%, Illinois is not just holding steady—it’s surging forward. Fueled by a strengthened tax credit program, a growing workforce training pipeline, and a series of buzzy film and TV projects—from FX’s The Bear to Netflix’s Monsters —the state is positioning itself as the next logical home for studios, writers’ rooms, and producers seeking a friendlier climate for production.
“Through the Film and TV Workforce Program, we have invested in the future of the industry – increasing diversity and building out a qualified pipeline of hundreds who are equipped to serve on film crews and making it possible for us to attract major productions,” said Governor JB Pritzker . “Our success is a testament to our hard work and partnership as well as the undeniable charm of Illinois and our people that makes us a prime creative destination.”
That pipeline is anchored by the state’s Film and TV Workforce Training Program , a diversity-first initiative that’s trained over 200 crew members per year since its inception in 2022. Run through the Illinois Film Office and community partners like Free Spirit Media , the program is developing new talent across departments and ensuring local crew can compete with seasoned teams from L.A., New York, and beyond.
The results speak volumes. While TV production in L.A. dropped more than 30% in Q1 of 2025—according to FilmLA’s latest data—Chicago has continued to serve as the home base for NBC’s One Chicago universe, The Bear , and Power Book IV: Force . Projects like Apple TV+’s Dark Matter and HBO Max’s Somebody Somewhere are bringing in out-of-state dollars, employing local crews, and showcasing Illinois on the global stage. Even Sundance hit Ghostlight , produced by Eddie Linker, credited the state tax credit as the deciding factor in getting the film made.
At a time when L.A. productions are shrinking—squeezed by high costs, dwindling streaming budgets, and a post-strike hangover—Illinois’ 30% tax credit on qualified expenditures (with an added 15% bonus for hiring from economically disadvantaged areas) is giving producers a reason to set up shop in Chicago. Crucially, unlike many competing states, Illinois has no cap on its film tax credit, making it attractive to projects of all scales.
“This is what happens when government supports the arts and the creative economy,” said Lt. Governor Juliana Stratton . “This didn’t happen by chance—it’s the result of deliberate policies, and it’s changing the narrative about where great storytelling happens.”
Now, the opportunity is clear—and Chicago stakeholders are ready to seize it.
According to FilmLA , 2024 saw the second-lowest year for L.A. TV filming in a decade, and 2025 has started worse. With backlot studio space gathering dust, the door is open for Chicago to expand not only as a location hub—but also as a home for full production ecosystems. That means attracting writers’ rooms, development teams, and even new soundstage infrastructure.
Studio executives are listening. The Bear has proven that a gritty, urban Chicago backdrop can carry national prestige and Emmy hardware. Pair that with state-funded training programs, a deepening crew base, and smart producers ready to roll—and it’s not hard to envision Chicago as the next must-shoot destination.
“We stand at the ready to work with the Governor, his team, and the General Assembly in growing the entertainment industry and contributing to the economic opportunities for our state and workforce,” said Tony Barracca, Business Manager for the Illinois Alliance of Theatrical State Employees Local 476.
With major productions like The Chi , Deli Boys , The Up and Comer , and Once Upon a Christmas Wish recently wrapping or launching in Illinois—and the state generating $6.81 in economic activity for every dollar spent on the credit—it’s becoming increasingly clear: the smart money is on Illinois.
“It’s really hard to find financing for movies in the current environment,” said Eddie Linker , producer of “Ghostlight.” “The ability to use the Illinois Tax Credit at almost any budget level is often the difference between making a movie or hoping to make a movie.”

House passes bill that could bring bigger film productions to Missouri - NewsBreak,"MISSOURI — The Missouri House voted “Do Pass” on a new bill Tuesday that could increase the tax credit available for film and series productions in the state. According to House Bill 1499, the bill would combine the tax credit available for TV projects and movies each year. Missouri began offering a tax credit for movie and TV productions in 2023, which offered $8 million for film and, separately, another $8 million for series productions. If passed, the bill would combine the two tax credit pots, attracting bigger productions to the Show-Me State. In August 2023, Missouri introduced the Show MO Act, which ended a decade-long lapse since Missouri’s previous tax credit program, which expired in 2013. According to the Missouri Division of Tourism, more than 40 projects have been approved since the launch of the tax incentives, with many more expected in the upcoming years. To qualify for the tax credit, production companies must first apply with the state and prove financial support for their project, then undergo an independent audit to verify spending. Afterward, the state will conduct an additional audit to ensure funds were accurately used and the production fulfilled its commitments after filming takes place in Missouri.

"为群众烦心事提供""最优解""","□ 本报记者 余东明 张海燕
□ 本报实习生 张晓颖
“您遗产继承的问题通过公证就能解决，不用打官司。”
“这份赋强调解公证书可以直接申请法院强制执行。”
“公证参与调解，专业靠谱又省心。”
……
近日，《法治日报》记者走访上海各公证处，欣喜地发现公证员在参与矛盾纠纷化解方面大显身手，为广大老百姓提供了更多更便捷的“最优解”方案。这背后离不开上海公证行业近年来与法院、商事调解组织、人民调解行业联合创设的多元协同平台。
“从预防潜在法律风险，到解决现实法律纠纷，上海公证行业不断拓展公证参与调解的服务范围，全方位、多层次、高品质助力‘平安上海’‘法治上海’建设。”上海市司法局副局长董海峰表示，多元协同平台的创设，使得公证调解力量得到合理配置和高效利用，并以更便捷、更划算、对抗性更小的方式为人民群众了却烦心事，充分彰显公证机构坚持和发展新时代“枫桥经验”的独特优势。
入驻人民法院
走进上海市松江区人民法院诉讼服务中心，“公证办理”窗口赫然在目，其中有一家人正在咨询房产继承问题。
“你们都有遗产继承权，也没有大矛盾，为了孩子能尽快入学办理继承房产过户，可以不用打官司，通过公证就能迅速办理好。”公证员弄清了他们的意图后，给出了可行性方案。
“公证文书是司法认可的‘强证明’，有些纠纷在诉讼服务中心经过公证员努力调解后，当事人已没有太大分歧，能够通过公证快速解决，节约了相应的司法资源与成本。”上海市公证协会副会长、松江公证处主任沈南说，“与法院合作开设公证专窗，为已缓和矛盾的当事人及时主动提供更加便捷有效的法律服务，也为法院缓解了‘案多人少’的压力。”
据了解，早在2017年，上海公证行业便参与人民法院司法辅助事务试点工作，不少公证机构先后与法院建立协同平台。在诉前，对双方无争议，但相关管理部门需要相关法律文书才能办理的事项，如法定继承过户房屋、机动车权利人变更等，当事人可以优先通过公证解决，从源头上分流案件。
在诉中，公证机构发挥公证提存和资金监管功能，缓解当事人对涉诉资产保全的顾虑，促进矛盾纠纷的高效化解；同时还在文书送达、调查取证、参与执行等环节提供公证服务，有效减轻法院压力，节约司法资源。
“公证作为预防性司法证明制度，是社会纠纷多元化解决的基础性资源。我们将在更大范围、更高层次上实现公证与审判执行的高效衔接，发挥公证在提高司法效率、推动司法改革、维护司法公信力中的专业优势。”沈南说。
携手商调机构
凭借宝山公证处出具的一纸执行证书，陈先生成功向法院申请强制执行。“打官司就是为了判决结果履行到位，现在凭借‘赋强公证’也能达到这个目的，而且效率高、成本低。”陈先生说。
此前，陈先生与公司发生股权转让纠纷，上海宝山区旋天调解事务所携手宝山公证处为其主持了调解，促成双方达成协议，并办理了赋强公证书，纠纷得以圆满化解。
“打官司在一定程度上会影响彼此的合作与信任，‘商事调解+公证’的协同联动，不仅可以高效解决问题，还更有利于维护交易各方的友好关系，避免‘涉诉信息’对企业征信的影响。”宝山公证处负责人张晓燕说。
据了解，去年5月，上海市司法局会同市高级人民法院、市商务委员会、市公安局、市市场监督管理局、市国有资产监督管理委员会、市工商业联合会印发《关于促进本市商事调解高质量发展的若干措施》，其中创新性提出试点“商事调解+公证”的赋强计划，鼓励支持商事调解组织与公证机构搭建协同平台。
目前，这一机制已广泛推行。在商事调解前，公证处可为当事人提供法律咨询、风险评估等服务。在调解过程中，公证员对调解协议的内容进行审查，确保协议的合法性、合理性和可行性。当事人成功达成调解协议后，可申请公证处为调解协议办理赋强公证，即赋予调解协议强制执行效力。如发生履行争议，公证处对违约情况进行核实后出具执行证书，债权人可直接向人民法院申请强制执行。
去年初，虹口公证处与上海市虹口北外滩多元商事调解中心签订战略合作协议，通过建立优化协同高效的矛盾纠纷化解机制，畅通案件的引流渠道，提供公证、调解、固化证据等全方位解纷辅助服务。
“我们正积极携手商调组织，协同解决商业纠纷，维护市场秩序，共同打造高效、便捷、融通的综合法律服务生态圈，进一步提升人民群众对法治化营商环境的获得感和满意度。”虹口公证处负责人富晓燕说。
跨界多元调解
经过数月筹备，上海市浦东新区公谐调解中心近日完成了50名调解员的选聘工作，这家由张江公证处发起设立的社会组织将全面开启调解业务。
“公证机构跨界融合多元调解，让广大调解员兼任公证联络员、公证员兼任调解员，搭建公证与调解的全方位协作和资源共享平台，可进一步提高解纷效率，降低解纷成本。”上海市公证协会副会长、张江公证处主任张磊说。
像这样的跨融调解组织在上海并非少数。此前，新虹桥公证处和上海翰海法律科技有限公司联合成立上海闵行区星虹桥金融商事调解中心，会聚公证员、律师等50余位专业人士，利用区块链电子签约、线上视频调解及外呼电话录音系统，已线上线下协同受理案件百余件，涉及标的总额达1000余万元，其中调解成功68件。
如今，上海越来越多的公证处正积极参与多元解纷工作，综合运用提存、资金监管、保全证据、履行监督、赋予债权文书强制执行效力等方式强化和巩固阶段性调解结果，并通过在线调解平台、微信小程序等工具，实现文书流转、证据保全、协议公证的数字化协同，提升效率并降低时间成本，帮助终局性调解成果快速实现。
全市公证员队伍也在不断适应新的工作方式和要求，充分发挥公证机构与其他民商事调解机构之间的协同作用，为当事人提供纠纷化解“最优解”方案，持续提升公证参与调解工作的能力和水平。
“充分激发公证行业的调解潜能，是坚持和发展新时代‘枫桥经验’的重要举措，也是进一步优化法治化营商环境的重要体现。”上海市公证协会会长陈铭勋表示，下一步，上海公证行业将持续探索和创新，对外加强协作联动，对内提升法治化、专业化、职业化能力水平，不断满足人民群众对公证服务的新期待、新要求。

Oregon lawmakers vote to limit rent increases for manufactured home owners,"The debate in the Oregon House on Wednesday over whether to cap rent increases on manufactured homes fell along familiar dividing lines; Republicans called for fewer regulations and a focus on housing supply, while Democrats cautioned the measure was necessary to keep vulnerable seniors housed.
Democrats won.
Rep. Pam Marsh, a Democrat from Ashland and an architect of the bill, House Bill 3054, said when she first ran for office her legislative district had the most manufactured homes in the state. Then the 2020 Almeda fire tore through the Rogue Valley, wiping out 1,500 manufactured homes in the span of a day.
The measure, she said, was crafted to help “Oregonians in our (manufactured) parks grow old in the homes and neighborhoods that provide comfort and support.”
Oregon has about 62,000 manufactured homes and more than 1,000 manufactured home parks throughout the state, Marsh said on the House floor. Residents often own their own home and pay rent to the landowner on which their home sits. They are often fixed to the site and therefore more vulnerable if rent is increased, since it’s costly to move their home.
“Unlike other renters, a manufactured home resident cannot pick up and move when the rents escalate,” Marsh said on the House floor. “Their only choice is to slash other expenditures in the household budget or to sell or even abandon the home.”
Similar debates are being waged nationwide, as investors have been scooping up manufactured homes and raising rents.
“These out-of-state corporate entities have little interest in the parks other than to exploit residents for as much profit as possible,” Marsh said.
Related: Oregon and Washington are preparing for fights over rent increases in manufactured home parks
The measure does try to account for local owners, the Democratic lawmaker noted. The bill lowers the allowable annual rent increase on manufactured home parks and marinas to 6%. That doesn’t apply to parks and marinas with 30 or fewer spaces, exempting them from the cap.
The measure also only applies to park residents who own their homes, if a person is renting the cap does not apply. It would also allow park owners who have more than 30 spaces to increase the rent by 12% to account for major infrastructure updates.
The current limit that can be charged is about 10%.
Republicans showed up to the House floor prepared to fight.
“It seems like this body is passing bills that make housing more expensive and then we see expensive housing,” said Republican Ed Diehl, of Scio. “Then we say, ‘Oh we need to respond to that.’” And so we do rate caps. It’s like we are in this housing doom loop.”
Diehl said he wants to see vulnerable seniors remain in their manufactured homes, but the solution, he said, is to build more houses, not add more constraints.
It was a refrain echoed by many Republicans.
“If our goal is to help those at the very lowest income levels, especially in manufactured home parks, there are better ways to do it. We can offer tax credits or targeted subsidies to park owners who voluntarily keep rents lower for those residents,” Diehl said. “That’s a solution that helps those in need without disrupting the broader housing market.”

Trump cites 'big progress' after talks with Japan on tariff deal,"U.S. President Donald Trump said negotiators made ""big progress” after a meeting with a Japanese delegation on Wednesday aimed at securing a deal that would avoid higher levies he has threatened against trading partners.
""A Great Honor to have just met with the Japanese Delegation on Trade. Big Progress,” Trump wrote in a post to his Truth Social network.
Trump earlier in the day had said he would personally attend the talks, which were led by the U.S. Treasury and Commerce Departments. Japan’s economic revitalization minister Ryosei Akazawa arrived in Washington to conduct the negotiations.
Foreign capitals are racing to negotiate deals with the U.S. to avert high import taxes Trump imposed — and then quickly paused — on about 60 trading partners.
The negotiations with Japan are being closely watched, offering a test case for other nations uncertain over what concessions Trump will seek to extract in exchange for trade agreements.
Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has said Japan, a military ally, will likely be prioritized as the U.S. deals with a flood of nations all looking to cut their own deals. Bessent has said he envisions reaching agreements with Japan and other military allies to develop a collective effort to apply economic pressure on China.",2025-04-17T01:26:00.000+03:00,https://www.japantimes.co.jp/business/2025/04/17/economy/trump-japan-trade-talks,Jennifer A Dlouhy,positive

House OKs boost for pediatric rare disease research,"The House has cleared and sent to the Senate for consideration a bill that would increase research into pediatric rare diseases.
The measure ( HB 907 ), sponsored by Republican Rep. Adam Anderson , is dubbed the Sunshine Genetics Act. It would establish the Florida Institute for Rare Diseases within the Florida State University (FSU) College of Medicine to identify ways to improve outcomes and increase quality of life for kids and families suffering from rare diseases.
“The Sunshine Genetics Act represents hope — for families, for the future, and for what’s possible when science and compassion come together,” Anderson said.
“As a father who lost a child to a rare genetic disease, I know the heartbreak and uncertainty too many families face. This bill puts Florida on the front lines of research, early detection, and treatment. It’s about ending the diagnostic odyssey and making sure no family ever feels alone on this journey again.”
The measure would also create the Sunshine Genetics Pilot program, which would offer genetic screening for newborns over a five-year period.
It would also establish the Sunshine Genetics Consortium, creating increased collaboration among geneticists, physicians, researchers and academic institutions and supporting innovation in genetic and precision medicine through annual reports. A board representing major medical and research organizations would oversee the consortium.
The bill will now head to the Senate for its consideration. If signed, it would take effect July 1.
Sen. Colleen Burton is carrying the Senate counterpart ( SB 1356 ), but her bill has stalled.
The issue of rare diseases is one Anderson often champions. His son, Andrew , suffered from Tay-Sachs disease, an ultrarare fatal genetic disorder with only 16 cases annually nationwide.
FSU opened a pediatric rare diseases institute last February after Anderson advocated for it and secured an initial $1 million grant. He later helped secure another $5 million in state funding, announced at the institute’s first symposium. The institute is part of FSU Health and works to help kids with rare diseases through research, education and clinical care.
There are more than 7,000 known rare diseases that affect some 350 million people worldwide, according to Anderson’s Office. His bill seeks to expand testing for such diseases, while accelerating medical research into their treatment and bringing hope to those who suffer and their families.
Last year, Anderson successfully ushered through a bill ( SB 1582 ) that created a grant program to fund scientific and clinical research on rare diseases.
The program facilitates scientific and clinical research grants to study pediatric rare diseases and calls for collaboration among universities, research institutes and community practitioners to ensure a comprehensive approach to advancing detection and treatment of rare diseases in children.
Since his son’s death, Anderson and his family have been active in advancing research in rare diseases through the Cure Tay Sachs Foundation and their AJ Anderson Foundation . Anderson previously worked with former House Speaker Chris Sprowls to create Tay Sachs Awareness Day in Florida on Aug. 10, Andrew’s birthday.",2025-04-17T01:27:00.000+03:00,https://floridapolitics.com/archives/732799-house-oks-boost-for-pediatric-rare-disease-research,Janelle Irwin Taylor,positive
Congressman Thompson endorses Horhn in Jackson mayor runoff,"Horhn and Lumumba face off in the Democratic Primary runoff on Tuesday. Congressman Bennie Thompson (D) publicly endorsed State Senator John Horhn (D) for Jackson Mayor Wednesday afternoon.
The endorsement could be yet another blow to incumbent Mayor Chokwe Lumumba’s re-election efforts as he was already battling through being indicted for bribery last October.
Horhn led the crowded field in the April 1 Democratic Primary, pulling in 48 percent of the vote. Lumumba, who drew 70 percent in the primary four years ago, only mustered 17 percent this cycle.
In a statement released Wednesday, Thompson praised Horhn for his ability to face Jackson’s many issues.
“Our capital city requires a leader at city hall who can work with the federal and state government, which currently isn’t happening. Given the many challenges facing Jackson, I am convinced that John Horhn is better suited to handle these challenges,” the Congressman said.
After detailed talks, Thompson said he and Horhn share a vision of moving Jackson forward, including in the areas of crime, public safety, urban blight, housing, economic development and transportation, and the “hostile takeover action” by state officials of the Jackson Medgar Wiley Evers International Airport.
“I know that federal, state, and local resources, along with private investments, are required to address Jackson’s many current problems and are essential for future long-term City of Jackson’s progress,” Thompson said.
Lumumba’s campaign did not immediately return a message seeking comment. His eight years in office have seen a series of problems arise in Jackson, ranging from the federal takeover of the city’s water system to high crime and murder rates to him and two other city officials being indicted on bribery charges. Public disputes between his administration and the Democratic controlled city council have also plagued his tenure.
Horhn and Lumumba face off Tuesday, April 22 in the Democratic Primary runoff. The winner will advance to the June 3 General Election.",2025-04-17T00:55:00.000+03:00,https://magnoliatribune.com/2025/04/16/congressman-thompson-endorses-horhn-in-jackson-mayor-runoff,Daniel Tyson,positive

新华社贝尔格莱德4月16日电（记者石中玉）塞尔维亚国民议会16日表决通过新一届政府组成名单，久罗·马楚特出任总理。
塞国民议会当天在51名议员缺席的情况下以153票赞成、46票反对的表决结果通过新内阁名单。新内阁设30名部长，其中包括3名副总理：西尼沙·马利任第一副总理兼财政部长、伊维察·达契奇任副总理兼内务部长、阿德里亚娜·梅萨罗维奇任副总理兼经济部长。新内阁成员在国民议会表决后宣誓就职。
马楚特15日在国民议会召开的特别会议上介绍其施政纲领时强调对内通过对话恢复稳定、对外独立平衡的政策重点。他呼吁全国团结与和解，强调“塞尔维亚厌倦分裂”。在国际事务上，马楚特表示塞尔维亚将在保持独立性的同时继续加入欧盟的进程，并继续致力于广泛的国际合作。

厚植党建底色 提升平安成色,"□ 本报记者 周孝清
□ 本报通讯员 龙浩然
荣获“平安中国建设示范市”“全国首批禁毒示范城市”称号、连续14年获评全省平安建设先进市……近年来，江西省景德镇市平安建设取得瞩目成绩。
一块块沉甸甸的奖牌，与景德镇推进平安建设提升基层社会治理效能密不可分。景德镇市委常委、政法委书记胡春平近日在接受《法治日报》记者采访时表示，景德镇近年来以党建引领政法工作高质量发展，构建以党建引领为中心、推行“党建+”的“一个中心、三个融合”工作模式，将党建力量根植内心，实现党建与特色队建、党建与基层网格、党建与红色文化深度融合，打造共建共治共享格局，谱写平安建设工作新篇章。
“党建+特色队建”筑牢平安根基
乐平市后港镇村民彭某、黄某与鲁某发生口角，黄某、彭某朝鲁某脸部击打，鲁某在躲避时闪了腰。经鉴定，鲁某腰椎骨折，损伤程度评定为轻伤二级。检察机关认为黄某、彭某的伤害行为与鲁某受伤之间难以认定存在刑法上的因果关系，遂作出不起诉决定。
鲁某对此决定不服，故而提出申诉。双方矛盾经多次调解仍无法化解。不久前，后港镇政法特派员吴少灏了解情况后，坚持情理法结合、多次上门调解安抚双方情绪。同时，邀请人民监督员担任听证员召开公开听证会，对检察机关的决定进行释法说理，听证员一致同意检察院的不起诉决定。最终，黄某、彭某赔偿鲁某，双方达成和解。
这起案例是景德镇政法特派员化解矛盾的生动实践。据了解，景德镇市委政法委建立“政法委员+政法特派员”工作机制，于2023年10月底在全市政法机关选拔53名40岁以下、有矛盾纠纷调处经验的干警担任乡镇（街道）政法特派员，派驻乡镇街道协助政法委员开展工作，提升基层政法工作质效。目前，全市政法特派员已经实现乡镇街道全覆盖，并组织召开联席会议150余场次，化解矛盾纠纷600多件。
此外，景德镇市委政法委体系化构建政治轮训平台，建立全省首个市级政法干部政治轮训基地和市政法系统干警教育培训基地，确定现场教学点6个，培育精品课程70余节，组织干警培训50余次，参训5000余人，全面提升干警政治素养。
“党建+基层网格”增强服务实效
去年，一场暴雨如注，乐平市众埠镇南山村水库堤坝出现宽1.8米的裂口，面对紧急情况，南山村党支部书记方光辉第一时间带领11名党员干部赶到现场冒雨奋战，经过5个多小时紧张抢修，30多根木桩被一一打下，70余只蛇皮袋装满泥沙，砌成了一道坚固的防线。
据介绍，景德镇建立健全“党（工）委+党支部+网格队伍”组织体系，将党委与综合网格深度融合。去年，网格由1682个调整至3082个，网格员同步调整配备到位。网格员用脚步丈量网格、用服务凝聚民心、用担当守护平安，着力打通基层治理的“毛细血管”。
“每个社区都设立党委，每个网格都设立党支部，充分发挥基层党组织战斗堡垒作用和党员先锋模范作用，增强了服务治理实效。”景德镇市委政法委副书记陈兴达介绍说，全市8000余名党员，到共建社区和居住地社区开展“双报到、双报告”，推动网格支部建设和党建工作力量深度融合。
如今，在景德镇，网格已成为群众与社区沟通的桥梁，把服务居民的“最后一公里”变为“最后一米”。
“党建+红色文化”打造特色品牌
今年63岁的方永红是景德镇市公安局退休干警，也是“老方说党史”宣讲团的领头人。他从小对党有着特殊感情，尤其爱听革命故事，每天都会聆听身边的老红军、老八路讲党史、军史，并产生了研究党史、传播党史的兴趣。他不断学习和收集党史资料，通过生动的讲述方式，将党史知识传递给身边的群众和同事。由于他的讲述深受大家喜爱，景德镇市公安局开始大力发掘和推广这一新颖的宣传教育方式。
2021年，景德镇市公安局选拔18名业务能手、先进典型、理论“达人”组成“老方说党史”小分队。如今小分队已经发展成由52名宣讲主力、83名后备宣讲员组成的宣讲团。宣讲团深入各单位、学校、社区开展宣讲活动1000余场，直接受众20万余人次，间接受众100万余人次，广受群众好评。
2018年，第一篇“老方说党史”文章在市公安局微信群发表，受到广泛转载、点赞，好评如潮。从2019年开始，市公安局通过“瓷都民警之家”微信公众号推送“老方说党史”专栏。5年来，“瓷都民警之家”持续推出“老方说党史”学习专栏1980余期，获点赞50多万个。
据了解，“老方说党史”宣讲团入选江西省机关党建品牌创新优秀案例，被中宣部评为“全国基层理论宣讲先进集体”。去年，“老方说党史”宣讲团被江西省公安厅授予集体二等功。

Kicillof selló nuevos acuerdos por seguridad | El gobernador reunió a intendentes de todas las tribus | Página|12,"Axel Kicillof recibió a diecinueve de intendentes de todas las tribus políticas en la Casa de Gobierno bonaerense , donde completó las firmas de adhesión al Fondo de Fortalecimiento de la Seguridad que días atrás había sellado con 103 jefes comunales .
“Desde el Gobierno nacional nos sacaron fondos que estaban específicamente dirigidos a la cuestión de la seguridad. Se hizo de manera ilegal, por eso estamos reclamando, y lo estamos haciendo en la Corte Suprema de Justicia , nos reintegre los fondos destinados a las compras de patrulleros y equipamiento de la Policía. Ese fondo de seguridad correspondía a un porcentaje de la coparticipación”, fustigó el gobernador.
El Fondo fue creado hace algunas semanas a través del Decreto 368/2025 por 71.500 millones de pesos. Se trata de un paquete de recursos para 44 municipios de más de 70 mil habitantes por 70 mil millones de pesos y otro para 14 municipios de hasta 70 mil habitantes por 1.500 millones de pesos.
“La provincia de Buenos Aires, por hechos históricos que nos anteceden, fue discriminada en materia de coparticipación y la problemática que esto genera está a la vista, así como queda muy claro cual es la discrepancia entre lo que la provincia aporta y lo que recibe luego de que los impuestos se recaudan. Es una injusticia histórica”, agregó.
En ese punto, recordó que la Provincia aporta 40 por ciento, pero solo llega un ínfimo porcentaje de eso. “Retuvieron ilegalmente 750 mil millones de pesos de un fondo de seguridad que era obligatorio distribuirlos por el presupuesto nacional. Por eso vamos a la Corte Suprema de Justicia, que es el lugar donde originariamente hay que discutir los referendos de este tipo entre las provincias y el gobierno nacional”, resaltó.
“Acá no hay referendo, hay robo a plena luz del día. Y casi dicho explícitamente: ‘los voy a fundir, les voy a sacar los recursos’, aun siendo ilegal”.
Más adelante, el gobernador adelantó que a las mil motos de alta cilindrada que adquirió la Provincia, sumará unas 700 más chicas con el fin de prevenir los delitos que se producen bajo esa modalidad.
“La inversión se realiza desde la Provincia pero se ejecuta desde los municipios. Son 170 mil millones de pesos de inversión pero no implica que dejemos de reclamar lo que le corresponde el fondo de seguridad del que nos han privado”, cerró.
Los intendentes que pusieron la forma fueron Emilio Cordonnier y Esteban Reino por la UCR ; Marcos Pisano, Francisco Echarren, Sebastián Ianantuony, Carlos Rocha, Freddy Zavatarelli, Damián Selci, Maximiliano Wesner, Mauro Poletti y Héctor Olivera , de Unión por la Patria.
Los del PRO fueron Sebastián Abella, Lisandro Matzkin, Pablo Petrecca y Soledad Martínez . También estuvo el vecinalista Matías Nebot y los tres de La Libertad Avanza , Diego Valenzuela, Ramiro Egüen y Fernanda Astorino.
Entre huidas y agradecimientos El variopinto de intendentes dejó lugar para todo: abrazos, agradecimientos, fotos y salidas anticipadas. El libertario de Tres de Febrero , Valenzuela, fue el primero. Apenas firmado el convenio, se levantó y dejó la Gobernación unos minutos después de que Kicillof empezó su discurso. Lo siguió luego su par de 25 de Mayo , el exGEN Egüen.
“Soy respetuoso de las instituciones, si convoca vengo y firmo. Convierte esto en una bajada de línea contra el Gobierno nacional. Todos sabemos que la provincia está discriminada, pero este sistema no lo inventó Javier Milei . Hay que cambiarlo todos juntos. Cuando pronuncia la palabra ‘robo’ me levanto y me voy, no puedo convalidar eso”, dijo Valenzuela en diálogo con Buenos Aires/12 a la salida del acto.
Al ser consultado sobre una posible solución, el alcalde dijo que el presidente Milei “comparte” que la Provincia es discriminada. “Él cree en la correspondencia fiscal. Cree que las provincias tienen que hacerse cargo de recaudar, creo que la discusión de la coparticipación es algo que se viene”, dijo.
A su turno, la vicepresidenta del PRO nacional, Soledad Martínez , valoró ante este medio “el hecho de poder generar un convenio más allá de los partidos de cada uno”. “La inseguridad en el conurbano está cada vez más intensa y violenta, los vecinos nos piden respuestas concretas y este acto es eso”, agregó.
El mandamás de Junín , Pablo Petrecca , ponderó que “siempre que haya fondos y sobre todo para seguridad, es muy importante; esto es una competencia de la Provincia, pero es importante que pueda haber una distribución de fondos para los municipios”.
“Los móviles de la Policía en el interior están totalmente amortizados, por eso es clave este fondo. La seguridad es lo más importante y destacamos que haya hechos concretos ante eso”, cerró.",2025-04-17T01:28:00.000+03:00,https://www.pagina12.com.ar/818783-kicillof-sello-nuevos-acuerdos-por-seguridad,María Belén Robledo,positive
永杉锂业：2024年扭亏为盈，但现金流和债务状况需关注,"近期 永杉锂业 （ 603399 ）发布2024年年报，证券之星财报模型分析如下：
　　 经营概况
　　永杉锂业在2024年的营业总收入为58.95亿元，同比下降21.45%。尽管收入有所下降，但公司实现了扭亏为盈，归母净利润达到2542.16万元，同比上升107.54%。扣非净利润为-7662.72万元，同比上升78.84%。毛利率为3.6%，同比增加了13.61%，净利率为0.54%，同比增加了110.97%。
　　 现金流状况
　　公司的现金流状况不容乐观。每股经营性现金流为-0.21元，同比减少了110.58%。经营活动产生的现金流量净额变动幅度为-110.52%，主要原因是报告期内收回的期初应收款较上年同期大幅减少以及报告期末收到的预收款项减少。
　　 债务状况
　　截至报告期末，公司的有息负债为8.01亿元，同比增加了17.71%。有息资产负债率已达23.11%，表明公司债务负担有所加重。此外，货币资金为6.15亿元，同比减少了46.65%，主要是由于回购股票及购买子公司少数股东股权、支付材料购买款项及工程建设投入。
　　 主营业务分析
　　 锂盐业务
　　锂盐业务实现营业收入10.15亿元，占总收入的17.21%，毛利率为13.69%。2024年全球锂盐市场供需再平衡，价格波动较大。公司采取“高周转，保交付”策略应对市场风险。
　　 钼业务
　　钼业务实现收入48.67亿元，占总收入的82.55%，毛利率为1.42%。钼业务供需结构调整，价格波动剧烈。国内钼矿山面临品位下滑、新矿开发缓慢的问题，钼精矿生产总量增速放缓。
　　 财务健康度
　　公司的现金资产较为健康，但应收账款状况值得关注。应收账款为2.77亿元，占利润的比例高达1090.05%，表明公司可能存在较大的应收账款回收风险。
　　 发展前景
　　公司未来将继续抓住新能源行业发展机遇，集中优势资源推动锂盐业务高质量发展，稳步推进钼产品业务。在锂盐业务上，公司将积极推进大矿企战略，确保锂矿石来源稳定可靠，并深化与正极材料领域头部企业的合作。在钼业务领域，公司将继续秉持“以效益为中心”的发展思路，重视产品质量提升，探索节能降耗路径，提升生产效益。
　　 总结
　　永杉锂业在2024年实现了扭亏为盈，但现金流和债务状况需引起关注。公司应继续优化现金流管理，加强应收账款的回收力度，同时合理控制债务规模，确保公司稳健发展。",2025-04-17T01:28:00.000+03:00,http://stock.10jqka.com.cn/20250417/c667524874.shtml,证券之星,positive

Turner
, President and CEO of Great Southern, commented, “Our first-quarter 2025 results reflect the strength of our underlying strategy and our ability to adapt with discipline amid ongoing economic and financial sector challenges. Our core banking fundamentals remain sound, with quarterly profitability strengthened by higher interest income, disciplined expense management, and favorable contributions from interest income recoveries and an expense reimbursement. We reported net income of $17.2 million , or $1.47 per diluted common share, for the first quarter of 2025, compared to $13.4 million , or $1.13 per diluted common share, in the same period last year. The increase in net income compared to the prior year quarter was primarily driven by strong growth in net interest income, which rose $4.5 million , or 10.1%, supported by increases in both loan yields and average loan balances. Additionally, a negative provision for losses on unfunded commitments of $348,000 in the first quarter of 2025, compared to a combined provision of $630,000 in the prior year quarter, contributed significantly to the improvement in profitability.” He noted, “Despite external economic pressures, our core operations remained strong. Total interest income for the first quarter of 2025 was $80.2 million , reflecting higher earning asset levels and loan yields. Net interest income for the quarter remained healthy at $49.3 million , supported by disciplined asset-liability management and a deliberate strategy to control funding costs through management of our funding mix and duration amid persistent deposit competition. Importantly, we saw no material deterioration in our core non-time deposit balances, reflecting customer stability and the durability of our franchise.”
Turner added, “Our balance sheet remains well positioned, with total assets of approximately $5.99 billion at March 31, 2025 , and a loan portfolio that has been carefully managed in terms of both growth and risk composition. We continue to emphasize prudent lending practices, focusing on relationship-based lending and credit quality rather than volume. Our allowance for credit losses stood at $64.7 million at March 31, 2025 , representing 1.36% of total loans. Our non-performing assets remained at minimal levels consistent with previous quarters, underscoring the strength of our underwriting standards and ongoing credit monitoring.”
He further noted, “On the expense side, we continued to demonstrate operating discipline. Noninterest expense totaled $34.8 million for the first quarter of 2025, flat from the prior-year first quarter despite inflationary pressures, with reductions in legal and professional fees offsetting modest increases in salaries, occupancy, and technology investments. Noninterest income totaled $6.6 million for the first quarter of 2025, which was generally consistent with the prior-year first quarter.”
Turner continued, “As we look ahead, our priorities remain unchanged. We will continue to manage costs tightly, safeguard credit quality, and strive to optimize our funding mix to ensure long-term financial stability. At March 31, 2025 , our capital and liquidity positions were solid, with a tangible common equity ratio of 10.1% and approximately $2 billion of secured available lines and on-balance sheet liquid assets, providing us with ample flexibility to support customers, pursue strategic growth opportunities, and continue returning value to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. In the first quarter of 2025 we repurchased nearly 175,000 shares of our common stock.”
“Great Southern’s Q1 2025 results underscore the consistency of our business model and our track record of delivering sustainable returns, supported by strong core fundamentals and disciplined execution. We remain focused on long-term value creation and are confident in our ability to navigate the current environment while continuing to serve our customers, communities, and shareholders,” Turner concluded.

This increase in net interest income was driven primarily by higher loan interest income and improved overall yields, as well as the strategic management of maturing/repricing brokered deposits and interest-bearing demand deposits. Net interest margin was 3.57% in the first quarter of 2025, compared to 3.32% in the same period of 2024 and 3.49% in the fourth quarter of 2024. The additional interest income items outlined above, under “First Quarter 2025 Key Results – Net Interest Income,” contributed 5 basis points to net interest margin in the first quarter of 2025. Compared to the 2024 first quarter, the average yield on loans increased 10 basis points, the average yield on investment securities increased 33 basis points and the average yield on other interest earning assets decreased 99 basis points. The average rate paid on interest-bearing demand and savings deposits, time deposits and brokered deposits decreased 29 basis points, 40 basis points and 67 basis points, respectively, in the three months ended March 31, 2025 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2024 . The average interest rate spread was 3.00% for the three months ended March 31, 2025 , compared to 2.66% for the three months ended March 31, 2024 , and 2.87% for the three months ended December 31, 2024 .
The average rates paid on deposits and borrowings decreased compared to the prior-year first quarter as market interest rates, primarily the federal funds rate and SOFR rates, declined in the fourth quarter of 2024. Yields on the Company’s portfolio of investment securities increased compared to the prior-year first quarter due to higher-yielding securities purchased in the second quarter of 2024. While market interest rates decreased compared to the first quarter of 2024, the average yield on loans increased slightly as cash flows from lower-rate fixed rate loans were redeployed into loans with comparably higher rates of interest.
To mitigate exposure to the risk of fluctuations in future cash flows resulting from changes in interest rates (primarily related to falling interest rates), the Company has, from time to time, strategically utilized derivative financial instruments, primarily interest rate swaps, as part of its interest rate risk management strategy.
The following table presents the effect of cash flow hedge accounting included in interest income in the consolidated statements of income:
 Three Months Ended March 31 , March 31 , December 31 , 2025 2024 2024 (In thousands) Terminated interest rate swaps $ 2,003 $ 2,025 $ 2,047 Active interest rate swaps (1,742 ) (4,653 ) (2,116 ) Increase (decrease) to interest income $ 261 $ (2,628 ) $ (69 ) The Company entered into an interest rate swap in October 2018 , which was terminated in March 2020 . Upon termination, the Company received $45.9 million , inclusive of accrued but unpaid interest, from its swap counterparty. The net amount, after deducting accrued interest and deferred income taxes, is being accreted to interest income on loans monthly until the original termination date of October 6, 2025 . After this date, the Company will no longer have the benefit of that income from the terminated swap. In 2025, the Company anticipates recording approximately $2.0 million in interest income from the terminated swap in each of the first three quarters, after which no further interest income will be realized.
The Company’s net interest income in the first quarter of 2025 increased 10.1% compared to net interest income in the first quarter of 2024. The cost of deposits has been negatively impacted over several quarters by the high level of competition for deposits across the industry and the lingering effects of liquidity events at several banks in March and April 2023 . After the second quarter of 2023, the Company had a significant amount of time deposits maturing at relatively low interest rates. These deposits were either renewed at higher rates or withdrawn, requiring the Company to replace the withdrawn deposits with other funding sources at the prevailing higher market rates. Market rates for time deposits for much of 2024 remained elevated, but have recently declined as the FOMC cut the federal funds rate by 100 basis points in late 2024 and signaled that further rate cuts may occur in 2025. As of March 31, 2025 , time deposit maturities over the next 12 months were as follows: within three months -- $669 million , with a weighted-average rate of 4.10%; within three to six months -- $495 million , with a weighted-average rate of 3.74%; and within six to twelve months -- $133 million , with a weighted-average rate of 3.23%. Based on time deposit market rates in March 2025 , replacement rates for these maturing time deposits are likely to be approximately 3.50-4.00%.
NON-INTEREST INCOME
For the quarter ended March 31, 2025 , non-interest income decreased $216,000 to $6.6 million when compared to the quarter ended March 31, 2024 . None of the components of non-interest income experienced increases or decreases exceeding $200,000 in comparing the two periods.
NON-INTEREST EXPENSE
For the quarter ended March 31, 2025 , non-interest expense increased $400,000 to $34.8 million when compared to the quarter ended March 31, 2024 , primarily as a result of the following items:
Net occupancy and equipment expenses: Net occupancy and equipment expenses increased $694,000 , or 8.9%, from the prior-year quarter. Various components of computer license and support expenses related to upgrades of core systems capabilities collectively increased by $322,000 in the first quarter of 2025 compared to the first quarter of 2024. Parking lot maintenance expenses, primarily related to above normal snow removal activity, collectively increased by $232,000 in the first quarter of 2025 compared to the first quarter of 2024.
Salaries and employee benefits: Salaries and employee benefits increased $473,000 , or 2.4%, from the prior-year quarter. Much of this increase related to normal annual merit increases in various lending and operations areas.
Legal, audit and other professional fees: Legal, audit and other professional fees decreased $687,000 from the prior-year quarter, to $1.0 million . In the quarter ended March 31, 2024 , the Company expensed a total of $929,000 related to training and implementation costs for the intended core systems conversion and professional fees to consultants engaged to support the Company’s proposed transition of core and ancillary software and information technology systems, with no such costs expensed in the quarter ended March 31, 2025 .
The Company’s efficiency ratio for the quarter ended March 31, 2025 , was 62.27% compared to 66.68% for the same quarter in 2024. The Company’s ratio of non-interest expense to average assets was 2.34% for the three months ended March 31, 2025 , compared to 2.39% for the three months ended March 31, 2024 . Average assets for the three months ended March 31, 2025 , increased $200.2 million , or 3.5%, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2024 , primarily due to growth in average balances of net loans receivable and investment securities.
INCOME TAXES
For the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, the Company's effective tax rate was 20.0% and 19.1%, respectively. These effective rates were below the statutory federal tax rate of 21%, due primarily to the utilization of certain investment tax credits and the Company’s tax-exempt investments and tax-exempt loans, which reduced the Company’s effective tax rate. The Company’s effective tax rate may fluctuate in future periods as it is impacted by the level and timing of the Company’s utilization of tax credits, the level of tax-exempt investments and loans, the amount of taxable income in various state jurisdictions and the overall level of pre-tax income. State tax expense estimates continually evolve as taxable income and apportionment between states are analyzed. The Company currently expects its effective tax rate (combined federal and state) will be approximately 18.0% to 20.0% in future periods.
CAPITAL
 March 31 , December 31 , 2025 2024 Consolidated Regulatory Capital Ratios (Preliminary) Tier 1 Leverage Ratio 11.3 % 11.4 % Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio 12.4 % 12.3 % Tier 1 Capital Ratio 12.9 % 12.8 % Total Capital Ratio 15.6 % 15.4 % Tangible Common Equity Ratio 10.1 % 9.9 % As of March 31, 2025 , total stockholders’ equity was $613.3 million , representing 10.2% of total assets and a book value of $53.03 per common share. This compares to total stockholders’ equity of $599.6 million , or 10.0% of total assets, and a book value of $51.14 per common share at December 31, 2024 . The $13.7 million increase in stockholders’ equity was primarily driven by $17.2 million in net income and a $1.2 million increase from stock option exercises, partially offset by $4.6 million in cash dividends declared on the Company’s common stock and $10.2 million in common stock repurchases.
Decreased unrealized losses on the Company’s available-for-sale investment securities and interest rate swaps, which totaled $44.1 million (net of taxes) at March 31, 2025 , also increased stockholders’ equity by $10.2 million during the quarter. These net unrealized losses primarily resulted from increased intermediate-term market interest rates in prior periods, which generally decreased the fair value of the investment securities and interest rate swaps.
The Company had unrealized losses on its portfolio of held-to-maturity investment securities, which totaled $20.6 million and $24.7 million at March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024 , respectively, that were not included in its total capital balance. If held-to-maturity unrealized losses were included in capital (net of taxes) at March 31, 2025 , they would have decreased total stockholder’s equity at that date by $15.6 million . This amount was equal to 2.5% of total stockholders’ equity of $613.3 million at March 31, 2025 , compared to 3.1% of total stockholders’ equity at December 31, 2024 .
In November 2022 , the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the purchase of an additional one million shares of the Company’s common stock. As of March 31, 2025 , approximately 270,000 shares remained available in this stock repurchase authorization.
In April 2025 , the Company’s Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program, which will succeed the existing repurchase program (authorized in November 2022 ) following the repurchase of the existing program’s remaining available shares. The new stock repurchase program authorizes the purchase, from time to time, of up to one million additional shares of the Company’s common stock.
During the three months ended March 31, 2025 , the Company repurchased 173,344 shares of its common stock at an average price of $58.38 , and the Company’s Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.40 per common share, which, combined, reduced stockholders’ equity by $14.8 million .
LIQUIDITY AND DEPOSITS
Liquidity is a measure of the Company’s ability to generate sufficient cash to meet present and future financial obligations in a timely manner. The Company’s primary sources of funds are customer deposits, FHLBank advances, other borrowings, loan repayments, unpledged securities, proceeds from sales of loans and available-for-sale securities and funds provided from operations. The Company utilizes some or all of these sources of funds depending on the comparative costs and availability at the time. The Company has from time to time chosen not to pay rates on deposits as high as the rates paid by certain of its competitors and, when believed to be appropriate, supplements deposits with less expensive alternative sources of funds. Management believes that the Company maintains overall liquidity sufficient to satisfy its depositors’ requirements and meet its borrowers’ credit needs.
At March 31, 2025 , the Company had the following available secured lines and on-balance sheet liquidity:
 March 31, 2025 Federal Home Loan Bank line $1,172.6 million Federal Reserve Bank line 370.5 million Cash and cash equivalents 217.2 million Unpledged securities – Available-for-sale 312.9 million Unpledged securities – Held-to-maturity 24.5 million During the three months ended March 31, 2025 , the Company’s total deposits increased $152.5 million . Interest-bearing checking balances increased $33.5 million (1.5%), primarily in certain money market accounts, and non-interest-bearing checking balances increased $9.7 million (1.2%). Time deposits generated through the Company’s banking center and corporate services networks decreased $14.1 million (1.8%). Brokered deposits increased $123.3 million (16.0%) through a variety of sources.
At March 31, 2025 , the Company had the following deposit balances:
 March 31, 2025 Interest-bearing checking $2,248.3 million Non-interest-bearing checking 852.7 million Time deposits 761.7 million Brokered deposits 895.4 million At March 31, 2025 , the Company estimated that its uninsured deposits, excluding deposit accounts of the Company’s consolidated subsidiaries, were approximately $683.9 million (14% of total deposits).
LOANS
Total net loans, excluding mortgage loans held for sale, were generally flat at $4.69 billion at March 31, 2025 compared to December 31, 2024 . Increases in other residential (multi-family) loans of $43.2 million and construction loans of $29.1 million were offset by decreases in commercial real estate loans and one- to four-family residential loans of $54.4 million and $10.3 million , respectively.
The pipeline of unfunded loan commitments decreased in the first quarter of 2025, primarily due to a decline related to construction loans. The unfunded portion of construction loans remained significant, notwithstanding this decline.
For additional details about the Company’s loan portfolio, please refer to the quarterly loan portfolio presentation available on the Company’s Investor Relations website under “Presentations.”
Loan commitments and the unfunded portion of loans at the dates indicated were as follows (in thousands):

During the quarter ended March 31, 2025 , the Company did not record a provision expense on its portfolio of outstanding loans, compared to a provision expense of $500,000 in the same period in 2024. Total net charge-offs were $56,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2025 , compared to net charge-offs of $83,000 during the same period in the prior year. Additionally, for the quarter ended March 31, 2025 , the Company recorded a negative provision for losses on unfunded commitments of $348,000 , compared to a provision expense of $130,000 for the same period in 2024.
The Bank’s allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans was 1.36% at March 31, 2025 , consistent with 1.36% at December 31, 2024 . Management considers the allowance for credit losses adequate to cover losses inherent in the Bank’s loan portfolio at March 31, 2025 , based on recent reviews of the portfolio and current economic conditions. However, if challenging economic conditions persist or worsen, or if management’s assessment of the loan portfolio changes, additional provisions for credit losses may be required, which could adversely impact the Company’s future financial performance.
ASSET QUALITY
At March 31, 2025 , non-performing assets were $9.5 million , a decrease of $48,000 from $9.6 million at December 31, 2024 . Non-performing assets as a percentage of total assets were 0.16% at both March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024 .

At March 31, 2025 , the commercial real estate category consisted of three loans, all of which are part of one relationship and were added in 2024. The commercial real estate relationship is collateralized by three nursing care facilities located in southwest Missouri . The borrower’s business cash flow was negatively impacted by a reduction in labor participation and increased operating costs as well as ongoing changes to the Missouri Medicaid reimbursement rate. Monthly payments were timely made prior to the transfer to this category and have continued to be paid timely. At March 31, 2025 , the one- to four-family residential category consisted of 12 loans, one of which was added to potential problem loans during the current quarter and one of which was transferred from the consumer category (the loan was drawn on a home equity line of credit) during the current quarter. The largest relationship in the one- to four-family category, mentioned above as the loan transferred from the consumer category, totaled $966,000 and is collateralized by a single-family residential property in the Orlando, Fla. area. At March 31, 2025 , the consumer category of potential problem loans consisted of 16 loans, six of which were added during the current quarter. The largest loan in the consumer category is a home equity loan totaling $748,000 related to the nursing care facility relationship, noted above.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
This document contains certain financial information determined by methods other than in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). This non-GAAP financial information includes the tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio.
In calculating the ratio of tangible common equity to tangible assets, we subtract period-end intangible assets from common equity and from total assets. Management believes that the presentation of this measure excluding the impact of intangible assets provides useful supplemental information that is helpful in understanding our financial condition and results of operations, as it provides a method to assess management’s success in utilizing our tangible capital as well as our capital strength. Management also believes that providing a measure that excludes balances of intangible assets, which are subjective components of valuation, facilitates the comparison of our performance with the performance of our peers. In addition, management believes that this is a standard financial measure used in the banking industry to evaluate performance.
This non-GAAP financial measurement is supplemental and is not a substitute for any analysis based on GAAP financial measures. Because not all companies use the same calculation of non-GAAP measures, this presentation may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures as calculated by other companies.

e-Dossier to revolutionalise criminal tracking system - The Tribune,"e-Dossier to revolutionalise criminal tracking system
In a major leap towards smarter policing and efficient criminal investigation, police authorities have revealed that an e-Dossier, a state-of-the-art digital application designed to centralise and enhance the management of criminal records across jurisdictions, has been created. This criminal record application can only be accessed by a police officer.
It took about three to four months to digitise the criminal records. Apart from that, a senior police official has written to departments of Punjab and Haryana to provide their criminal records as well to integrate in the e-Dossier before a formal launch. Expected to be available in a few months, this will help officials keep tab on bad characters, thieves, snatchers and criminals associated with gangs in a respective area.
According to a senior police official, “Because of porous borders, a crime is often committed in Mohali or Panchkula, and the criminal is apprehended in Chandigarh or vice-versa. So, the e-Dossier will be more helpful if it is exhaustive and includes criminal data from neighboring cities as well.”
The Modus Operandi (MO) Bureau, a unit under the control of the DSP (Crime) in Chandigarh Police, played a crucial role in digitising records of roughly 37,000 criminals.
The e-Dossier promises a seismic shift in how law enforcement agencies handle criminal data. At its core is the generation of a unique criminal ID for each offender, consolidating a wide range of data — from personal and physical characteristics to gang affiliations and crime histories — into a single, comprehensive profile.
In addition to storing multiple FIRs per individual, the platform creates a full network analysis of suspects, recording ties to sureties, associates, relatives and even receivers of stolen property.
The platform also supports real-time tracing, with dedicated entries for individuals who may assist in locating offenders and maintains records on proclaimed offenders and convictions. It incorporates a powerful, multi-parameter search engine that allows investigators to scout databases using facial recognition, names, arrest dates, crime types and more. This dramatically accelerates the identification process and enhances operational efficiency during critical investigations.",2025-04-17T00:43:00.000+03:00,https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/e-dossier-to-revolutionalise-criminal-tracking-system,Sheetal,positive

年内IPO撤否数量大减 还有188家企业排队审核|申报_新浪财经_新浪网,"在之前拟IPO企业大批量撤否之后，今年以来IPO折戟的数量逐月减少，4月份以来尚未有拟IPO企业终止审核。
　　相较而言，拟IPO企业过会、注册生效的进展不断。今年以来至4月16日，共有13家拟IPO企业过会，其中4月份以来有5家企业过会；共有18家注册生效，其中4月份以来有3家获得注册批文。
　　截至目前，沪深北三地交易所共有在审IPO企业188家。其中，北交所在审93家，占据半壁江山；上交所和深交所分别有48家和47家在审企业。按板块看，目前，科创板在审企业最少，仅有19家。
　　这188家在审企业，由45家券商保荐。其中， 国泰海通 手握的IPO在审项目最多，多数申报科创板上市；保荐项目数量排在前五的还有 中信证券 、 中信建投 、 招商证券 、 中金公司 ，这些券商保荐的项目全部申请在北交所上市。
4月尚无企业终止审核
　　在去年逾400家企业IPO折戟后，今年以来拟IPO企业终止审核、终止注册的节奏有所放缓。
　　根据沪深北交易所披露的信息统计，今年以来有54家企业的IPO申请终止审核或者终止注册，其中1月份有29家，2月份15家，3月份10家，4月以来尚未有企业终止IPO进程。以此来看，今年以来，IPO终止审核或者终止注册数量呈现逐月减少的态势。
　　相较而言，2024年1月1日至4月16日，共有113家企业终止IPO进程，其中1月份和3月份的终止数量均超过30家，2月份终止了21家，4月1日至4月16日终止了25家。
　　以此来看，今年以来IPO终止的企业数量相较去年同期减少了52%。
　　在IPO“撤退”放缓的同时，IPO过会、注册等环节则新进展不断。其中，4月份，不到半个月的时间便有5家拟IPO企业过会，4月7日～4月13日单周就有4家企业过会，创下年内新高。
　　在这之前1月份～3月份过会的拟IPO企业分别有1家、3家、4家。今年以来，共有13家拟IPO企业过会。值得注意的是，今年以来上会的企业全部获得通过，过会率达100%。
　　这些过会的企业在提交注册之后，获得IPO批文的时间也较为快速。比如，中策橡胶集团股份有限公司在2月13日过会后，2月28日拿到IPO批文；江苏汉邦科技股份有限公司的IPO申请于2月21日过会，3月6日便注册生效。这两家企业均半个月左右时间便拿到批文。
　　今年以来，拿到注册批文的企业共有18家，其中1月份2家、2月份5家、3月份8家，4月以来有3家。其中，两家“钉子户”获得IPO批文，受到市场关注。北京屹唐 半导体 科技股份有限公司过会后排队了近3年半才获得批文，影石创新科技股份有限公司则是排队四年之久，提交注册3年多后才获得批文。
　　受理端，今年以来，沪深北交易所已新增受理8单上市申请。其中，北交所5单、上交所2单、深交所1单。其中，申报科创板的北京昂瑞微电子技术股份有限公司为未盈利企业。
　　截至4月16日，沪深北三地交易所共有在审IPO企业188家。其中，北交所在审93家，占据半壁江山；上交所和深交所分别有48家和47家在审企业。按板块看，目前，科创板在审企业最少，仅有19家；创业板在审企业有23家；沪市主板、深市主板在审企业数量分别为29家、24家。
多家券商将项目全部押注在北交所
　　这188家在审企业，由45家券商投行担任保荐机构，其中4家企业由两家券商联合保荐。
　　具体来看，合并重组后的 国泰海通 拥有IPO在审项目24.5单（联合保荐按0.5单计，下同），市场份额达13%，排名第一，遥遥领先于其他保荐机构。
国泰海通 保荐的IPO企业中，2家报送证监会、5家处于回复问询阶段，其余企业均处于中止审查状态。这些项目中，16.5单申报科创板上市、5单申报上证主板上市，3单申报创业板上市。

"As San Antonio sees drop in crime, City Council members ask SAPD to target property crime","Crimes against persons and property are down this year in San Antonio, according to newly released statistics from the San Antonio Police Department.
Police Chief William McManus presented the data for the first quarter of 2025 to the five-member Public Safety Committee on Tuesday.
Property crimes are down 24.5%, motor vehicle thefts are down 43.2% and burglaries are down 2.2%.
Violent crime is down by 12.8%, with “double-digit reductions” in reported cases of assault, homicide, human trafficking, kidnapping and sex offenses.
Overall, there was a 19.3% decrease in all crime offenses compared to the first quarter of 2024.
Despite the numbers, the committee told McManus that not all residents of the city feel like there’s been a reduction in crime. They urged the chief to target property crime as much as violent crime.
“People will say they just don’t see it, [either] because their car got broken into or [something else],” said District 6 Councilwoman Melissa Cabello Havrda, who chairs the committee and is running for mayor. “We all react to what we see in front of us.”
District 10 Councilman Marc Whyte said he heard similar concerns from his constituents.
“If you look at January to March of this year, [there are] about 77 crimes a day against people and 233 crimes against our citizens’ property per day. That’s what we’ve been experiencing so far in 2025,” he said.
Whyte said the presentation to the committee last month on hotspot policing strategies focused on violent crime showed that having more police on the streets reduces crime.
He proposed funding for an additional 100 police officers and 100 more next year to “speed up” the city’s plan to add 65 police officers in each of the next three years.
Council members agreed that as much effort and intention should be put into addressing property crimes in San Antonio. They disagreed, however, on whether adding more police on the streets was the best way to do that.
District 2 Councilman Jalen McKee-Rodriguez said the data is important to make decisions, but the hotspot strategy isn’t working because of more police officers on the street.
“When you more strategically invest your resources, including police officers, into the areas they’re most needed, that’s when you see the benefit,” he said, adding that there is no data that shows increasing officers decreases crime .
McManus said adding more police would help move some police into investigative roles to help target property crime.
“When the criminal justice system is working in sync, I think crime tends to trend down,” he said.",2025-04-17T01:27:00.000+03:00,https://sanantonioreport.org/san-antonio-crime-down-2025-q1-target-property-crime,Raquel Torres,positive

El gobernador de la provincia de Buenos Aires , Axel Kicillof , encabezó este miércoles -junto al ministro de Seguridad, Javier Alonso- el acto en el que 19 intendentes bonaerenses firmaron su adhesión al Fondo de Fortalecimiento de la Seguridad.
En ese marco, Kicillof afirmó: “ Esta es una inversión provincial que ejecutarán cada uno de los distritos: trabajamos de forma coordinada porque nos votaron para que el Estado funcione mejor y brinde respuestas a las necesidades de nuestro pueblo ”. “Este gran esfuerzo, con el que vamos a seguir sumando patrulleros, equipamiento y tecnología en los 135 municipios, no implica que dejemos de reclamar ante la Corte Suprema los recursos que la Nación les quitó a los y las bonaerenses de manera ilegal ”, añadió.
Durante el acto, llevado a cabo en el Salón Dorado de la Casa de Gobierno, Kicillof también señaló: “ Dicen explícitamente que quieren fundir a las provincias pero esos recursos son el fruto del esfuerzo de los trabajadores bonaerenses y deben ser utilizados por el Estado nacional para cumplir con sus obligaciones ”. Y agregço: “Desde la Provincia podemos trabajar todos los días para compensar esta situación, pero un país federal no puede prescindir del Gobierno nacional” .
_77A5219~2.JPG Una inversión de 170-000 millones en seguridad Presentado el pasado 26 de marzo en la Escuela de la Policía “Juan Vucetich”, el fondo implica una inversión de $170.000 millones para fortalecer la seguridad en los 135 distritos. Prevé la compra de vehículos policiales, infraestructura, equipamiento y otros gastos en los municipios con más de 70.000 habitantes, y la triplicación de los recursos para las policías comunales en los distritos con menos habitantes. Asimismo, se adquirieron 750 nuevos patrulleros y 700 motos para la Policía provincial.
Durante el acto, Alonso subrayó: “ Este amplio fondo forma parte de una política de seguridad que se lleva adelante con los 135 intendentes, teniendo en cuenta las características y los tratamientos de los municipios: lo hacemos sin ningún tipo de distinción política, pensando únicamente en seguir llevando más tranquilidad a cada barrio bonaerense ”.
Por último, Kicillof subrayó: “ Nuestro mandato no es destruir el Estado, al contrario, es ampliarlo para seguir otorgando derechos y trabajando para que nuestra sociedad tenga más trabajo, salud, educación y seguridad ”.
En esta oportunidad, suscribieron el convenio las y los intendentes de Ayacucho, Emilio Cordonnier; de Balcarce, Esteban Reino; de Bolívar, Marcos Pisano; de Campana, Sebastián Abella; de Capitán Sarmiento, Fernanda Astorino Hurtado; de Castelli, Francisco Echarren; de Coronel Pringles, Lisandro Matzkin; de General Alvarado, Sebastián Ianantuony; de General Guido, Carlos Rocha; de General Pinto, Alfredo Zavatarelli; de Hurlingham, Damián Selci; de Junín, Pablo Petrecca; de Olavarría, Maximiliano Wesner; de Ramallo, Mauro Poletti; de Saavedra, Matías Nebot; de Tordillo, Héctor Olivera; de Tres de Febrero, Diego Valenzuela; de Veinticinco de Mayo, Ramiro Egüen; y de Vicente López, Soledad Martínez.

AEPA 2015: diez años de defensa del patrimonio de Algeciras,"AEPA 2015: diez años de defensa del patrimonio de Algeciras
Tribuna de opinión
El autor repasa los principales hitos para la creación del colectivo y las actividades promovidas en su primera década de funcionamiento
""Amar el patrimonio es un deber compartido, un acto de identidad colectiva"", defiende Barreno
Algeciras/Corría el año 2015 cuando un grupo de personas inquietas, amantes de la historia y conscientes del inmenso valor que guarda cada rincón de Algeciras, alumnos del CEPER Juan Ramón Jiménez, decidió dar un paso al frente bajo la tutela del profesor Roberto Godino Hurtado y el apoyo de la directora del centro, Carmen Fuentes Rodríguez. Así nació la Asociación de Emprendedores del Patrimonio de Algeciras -AEPA 2015- cuyo primer presidente fue Francisco López Muñoz, quien no solo vino a cubrir un vacío, sino que desde entonces ha creado un puente firme entre el pasado, el presente y el futuro de la ciudad y su patrimonio.
Desde el principio, AEPA 2015 no ha dejado de sorprender por su dinamismo, creatividad y compromiso. Año tras año, su calendario se ha llenado de actividades que han sabido combinar el rigor histórico con la divulgación acercando de esta forma el patrimonio local a quienes quizá nunca lo habían mirado de cerca, simplemente porque no lo conocían. Visitas guiadas, rutas temáticas, conferencias, exposiciones, talleres y jornadas culturales o la presentación de libros han permitido la puesta en valor desde la Algeciras de tiempo inmemorial hasta el legado industrial, pasando por la memoria de sus barrios, sus sorprendentes historias cotidianas y la arquitectura olvidada de sus calles.
La creación de AEPA 2015 ha contribuido a que el patrimonio de Algeciras haya dejado de ser algo relegado a documentos, vitrinas o simples recuerdos. Se convirtió en un relato vivo en el que cada algecireño y cualquier visitante puede reconocerse y sentirse parte de él. Ha sabido demostrar que conocer es el primer paso para proteger, y que amar el patrimonio es un deber compartido, un acto de identidad colectiva.
A lo largo de estos diez años se han sucedido bajo su prolífica actividad muchos acontecimientos dignos de remarcar como, a modo de ejemplo, la firma de dos convenios con el Ayuntamiento; la cesión de un local para nuestra sede tras la primera cesión provisional de un aula en el edificio Pérez Villalta; donación de libros y enseres por parte de diferentes algecireños para su custodia; el programa de charlas escolares en los centros de enseñanza; la visita al Parlamento de Andalucía; la rotulación de una calle con el nombre de María de la Iglesia en La Bajadilla; la concesión en 2017 del galardón del Día de Andalucía; visitas con grupos de fuera como la Coral Polifónica de Ciudad Real; innumerables visitas al reloj de la torre de la iglesia; reconocimiento por APM Terminals y subvención de 2.000 euros; nombramiento de José Luis Pavón Manso, nuestro relojero mayor, como hijo adoptivo de Algeciras; fiesta infantil al mediodía de los 31 de diciembre; el tradicional arrastre de latas; instauración del premio Patrimonio de Algeciras, concedido en su primera edición al Puerto de Algeciras o figurar como testigo en la cesión al museo de Algeciras de la importante colección de Antonio Viñas de Roa por parte de su familia, felizmente expuesta hoy en la capilla del Santo Cristo de la Alameda. Tantas y tantas actividades que sería imposible enumerarlas todas, pero que en su día quedaron fielmente reflejadas en nuestro boletín mensual de noticias que tuvo su primera aparición en abril de 2017.
Hoy, cuando echamos la vista atrás, vemos el camino recorrido y solo cabe expresar un profundo agradecimiento. Que vengan muchos años más de trabajo, descubrimiento, reivindicación del patrimonio, tanto del desaparecido, como proteger el existente para que no inicie el camino de la desaparición como ha sucedido en tantas ocasiones. Para ello contaremos con los más de 350 socios capaces de convertir cada hallazgo en un motivo de orgullo y cada historia recuperada en un legado para generaciones futuras. Seguiremos perseverando en la consecución de reivindicaciones que consideramos justas, a pesar de haberlo intentado ya sin éxito, como que un día por fin pueda sonar la guitarra de nuestro algecireño más universal, Paco de Lucía, en la torre de la iglesia de Nuestra Señora de la Palma. Es un homenaje y un reconocimiento que su pueblo le debe al genio.
Desde esta página es de justicia hacer un recordatorio a los que, de una forma u otra, bien como directivos o como socios, se embarcaron en este proyecto y que lamentablemente ya no están con nosotros. Son muchos, pero cito algunos en nombre de todos los que nos dejaron: Manolo Narváez, José María Contreras, Manolo Viñas, Juan López Ortega, Miguel A. Martín Montoya, Reyes Yera, Sofía García Millán, Justo San Salvador… Seguramente habrá algunos más, pero son aquellos que dejaron de asistir a nuestros actos porque se fueron por la puerta del silencio, aquella que impide que hayamos notado su ausencia.
En nombre de ellos y de todos los que seguimos componiendo este maravilloso grupo, seguiremos mirando Algeciras con los ojos de cariño y de respeto que nace del verdadero conocimiento de nuestra ciudad.",2025-04-17T00:07:00.000+03:00,https://www.europasur.es/algeciras/aepa-2015-diez-anos-defensa-patrimonio_0_2003682163.html,Juan Barreno,positive

White House invites Rachel Morin's mother to press briefing to share daughter's story - NewsBreak,"The mother of a Maryland woman who was killed by an individual who entered the country illegally addressed reporters at the White House on Wednesday as the Trump administration seeks to go on offense over the case of an individual who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador. Patty Morin, whose daughter Rachel’s 2023 killing became a flashpoint in the presidential campaign last year, was a “special guest” of the White House at a previously unscheduled briefing with reporters. Press secretary Karoline Leavitt opened the briefing by criticizing Democrats for their outrage over the deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man the administration had acknowledged in court documents it mistakenly deported to a notorious El Salvador prison. In her remarks to reporters, Patty Morin argued that deporting those in the country illegally was a matter of common sense and putting U.S. citizens first. “Why should we allow violent criminals that have no conscience at all to murder our mothers, our sisters, our daughters?” Patty Morin said. “We are American citizens. We need to protect our families, our borders, our children.” Patty Morin shared graphic details about her daughter’s death and how she was violently attacked. Her killer, Victor Martinez-Hernandez, was found guilty Monday . Martinez-Hernandez has been accused of illegally entering the United States from El Salvador. Leavitt asked if any reporters had questions at the conclusion of Patty Morin’s remarks. While some reporters raised their hands and said they had questions, Leavitt ended the briefing without taking any. “Please tell the truth. Tell how violent it really is. This is about protecting our children. It’s more than just politics or votes or just anything,” Patty Morin said as she left the room. The impromptu briefing came amid a firestorm over the government’s deportation of Abrego Garcia, an El Salvador national with no connection to Morin’s death. Leavitt also highlighted documents released by the Department of Homeland Security that showed Abrego Garcia’s wife sought a restraining order against him in 2021. Maryland court records show the complaint was dismissed after Abrego Garcia’s wife did not show up in court. Attorney General Pam Bondi also shared documents on social media purporting to show legal documents from Prince George’s County, Md., and the Justice Department that relate to Abrego Garcia’s immigration status and an investigation into whether he was an MS-13 gang member, which he denies. The administration’s refusal to return Abrego Garcia has caused an uproar among Democrats and civil rights groups, which have accused the government of violating his rights and ignoring due process. The White House has responded by more aggressively asserting that Abrego Garcia had ties to the MS-13 gang and insisting he would be deported again if he were returned to the U.S. Abrego Garcia’s family has denied he had ties to MS-13.

在马来西亚总理安瓦尔举行的欢迎宴会上的致辞|安瓦尔_新浪财经_新浪网,"尊敬的安瓦尔总理，
　　女士们，先生们，朋友们：
　　感谢安瓦尔总理热情洋溢的讲话。很高兴应易卜拉欣最高元首陛下邀请，对马来西亚进行国事访问。我谨对马方的周到安排和盛情款待表示衷心感谢。
　　“未之见而亲焉，可以往矣；久而不忘焉，可以来矣。”我上次访问马来西亚是2013年，贵国风光旖旎、文化多元、人民友善，给我留下深刻印象。时隔12年再次来访，看到马来西亚国家发展蒸蒸日上，现代化建设取得显著成就，我由衷地感到高兴。相信在最高元首陛下和安瓦尔总理带领下，马来西亚一定会不断释放发展活力，沿着“昌明大马”的道路取得更加辉煌的成就。
　　中马两国隔海相望，传统友好跨越千年。马来西亚谚语讲：“勤勉不息，日久成山。”建交50多年来，在双方共同努力下，中马关系坚如磐石、历久弥坚，已经成为政治上互尊互信、经济上互利共赢、文化上互鉴共促的亲密朋友和伙伴，给两国人民带来实实在在的好处。2023年，我同总理先生宣布共建中马命运共同体，开启了双边关系新的历史篇章。
　　刚才，我同安瓦尔总理举行了亲切友好的会谈，我们就深化两国各领域交往合作达成一系列重要共识。面对当前国际秩序和经济全球化遭受冲击，两国将同地区国家团结一致，共同抵御地缘政治和阵营对抗暗流，冲破单边主义和保护主义逆流，守护好亚洲家园的美好发展前景。
　　中马友好顺应历史潮流，未来可期。中方期待同马方一道，携手构建高水平战略性中马命运共同体，打造中马关系新的“黄金50年”，为两国各自现代化进程提供更大助力，为全球南方树立团结合作典范，为促进地区乃至世界和平、稳定、繁荣作出新的更大贡献。
　　最后，
　　祝马来西亚繁荣昌盛、人民幸福安康！
　　祝安瓦尔总理和在座各位朋友身体健康、诸事顺遂！
　　祝中马友谊万古长青！
　　谢谢大家！

　　太皇的小女儿阿伦公主对这温暖一幕印象深刻。“这是只有最尊贵、最亲密的客人才能享有的待遇，让我感受到两国根植于历史的深厚情谊。”阿伦公主说，她对习近平主席再度访问柬埔寨热烈欢迎，充满期待，相信这次历史性访问将成为一座鼓舞人心的灯塔，照亮柬中加强互利合作和伙伴关系的前行之路。
　　中国和柬埔寨是同甘共苦、守望相助的铁杆朋友。回望历史，中柬传统友谊由两国老一辈领导人共同缔造、精心培育。数十年来，中柬始终坚定支持彼此核心利益，两国友谊历经风云变幻考验，始终根深叶茂。近年来，在两国领导人战略引领下，中柬命运共同体建设迈入高质量、高水平、高标准的新时代。
　　柬中友好协会主席艾森沃用“牢不可破”形容柬中关系。他说，两国树立了大小国家平等相待、互利共赢的典范，他为柬中铁杆友谊感到自豪。“期待习近平主席此访进一步巩固两国团结合作，推动柬中命运共同体建设取得更多丰硕成果。”
　　柬埔寨贝尔泰国际大学教授约瑟夫·马修斯表示，中方始终支持柬埔寨在地区和国际事务中发挥更大作用，不断加强两国在东盟、澜湄合作等多边平台的协调配合，为维护发展中国家利益、壮大全球南方力量作出贡献。他相信，习近平主席此访将进一步丰富两国铁杆友谊的深刻内涵，成为柬中传统友好新的里程碑。
　　“架起通向希望与发展的桥梁”
　　“习近平主席的访问足以表明两国关系正在不断巩固并持续发展。”柬埔寨首相洪玛奈12日说，柬中深厚友谊与合作是双方携手并进的坚实基础。
　　当天，由上海建工集团股份有限公司承建的柬埔寨71C号国家公路在柬埔寨特本克蒙举行通车启用仪式。柬方表示，71C号国家公路与已建成的柬中友谊大桥相辅相成，改善了交通条件，促进人文交流与商贸往来，真正架起一座通向希望与发展的桥梁。洪玛奈在致辞中说，这是“柬中务实合作的又一有力见证”。
　　这些年来，中柬“钻石六边”合作架构不断充实，“工业发展走廊”和“鱼米走廊”建设持续推进；中国连续多年是柬埔寨最大外资来源国和最大贸易伙伴，过去10年双边贸易额增长近4倍；中柬自贸协定和《区域全面经济伙伴关系协定》生效实施带来的政策红利持续释放；金港高速公路、西哈努克港经济特区等中柬共建“一带一路”合作重点项目为柬埔寨发展繁荣带来新动能……
　　“依托‘一带一路’倡议，金港高速公路等多个项目加强了柬埔寨与世界的联通，让柬埔寨走上发展快车道。期待习近平主席此访能为柬埔寨带来更多机遇，为两国互利合作开辟更广阔前景。”柬埔寨商业部国务秘书兼发言人宾索维吉说。
　　柬埔寨皇家科学院国际关系研究所国际经济系主任洪瓦纳表示，中国秉持开放理念，积极与柬方共享技术和经验，有效提升柬埔寨自主发展能力。“期待此访助力柬埔寨实现有韧性的可持续发展。希望在两国领导人战略引领下，柬中能不断发掘未来合作新的发力点，实现优势互补。”
　　“中国高质量发展道路为柬埔寨提供有益借鉴。”柬埔寨证券公司董事会主席邓镇岳说，中国创造了举世瞩目的绿色发展奇迹，在科技创新领域也取得长足进步。“期待此访进一步深化柬中两国在清洁能源、人工智能等领域合作，推动两国务实合作朝着更高质量、更高水平方向前进。”
　　“为两国铁杆友谊汇聚友好力量”
　　中国和柬埔寨都是文明古国，两国间人文交流源远流长。中国元代使节在《真腊风土记》一书中记载了两国人民的友好往来，柬埔寨巴戎寺壁画上展示了古代中国商人同柬埔寨人民往来的生动情景。
　　“柬中两国都有深厚历史和灿烂文明，有着精神共鸣，这为两国民心相通奠定坚实基础。”柬埔寨吴哥古迹保护和管理机构副局长兼发言人隆戈萨说，两国多年来积极开展古迹修复合作，正是两个文明之间互学互鉴的体现。“期待习近平主席此访深化柬中文明对话，进一步拉近柬中人民的心灵。”
　　2019年举办“中柬文化旅游年”，2023年举办“中柬友好年”，2024年举办“中柬人文交流年”……种类多样的交流活动近年来在两国轮番登场，中柬人民相知愈深、友谊愈坚。
　　去年4月，“当少林遇见吴哥”功夫文化交流活动在柬埔寨暹粒举行。中国武僧与柬埔寨斗狮拳手同台，给亚太旅游协会柬埔寨分会主席吞西南留下深刻印象。吞西南说，各类民间交流活动为两国人民深入体验对方文化提供宝贵契机，期盼习近平主席的访问能给柬中文化交流带来更多暖意，不断增进两国人民了解与信任。
　　随着中国文化在柬埔寨影响力不断扩大，当地民众学习中文的热情持续升温。柬埔寨开办了4所孔子学院，另有多个孔子课堂和汉语中心，中文已纳入柬国民教育体系。作为中国职业教育第一所海外应用技术大学，中柬共建的柬华应用科技大学采用“技能+中文”模式，助力柬埔寨复合型人才教育培养。
　　“柬中人文纽带日益紧密，两国在教育、医疗、体育、旅游等领域合作潜力巨大。”柬埔寨皇家科学院孔子学院柬方院长陈统崇说。“我对习近平主席此次访问充满期待，相信此访将推动柬中人文交流不断走深走实，为两国铁杆友谊汇聚友好力量、提供人文支撑。”新华社",2025-04-17T01:29:00.000+03:00,https://finance.sina.com.cn/jjxw/2025-04-17/doc-inetmkhi3880561.shtml,sina.com.cn,positive
一季度国民经济起步平稳开局良好，高质量发展向新向好 四项数据看开局（经济新方位） _ 东方财富网,"生产供给较快增长，新质生产力加快培育，国内需求不断扩大，就业形势总体稳定……国家统计局4月16日发布数据显示：今年一季度，随着各项宏观政策继续发力显效，国民经济起步平稳、开局良好，高质量发展向新向好，彰显了中国经济强大的韧性和潜力。
　　良好开局怎么看？16日召开的国务院新闻办新闻发布会上，国家统计局副局长盛来运结合数据介绍了有关情况。
　　 从“5.4%”看发展韧性
　　【亮点】一季度，国内生产总值同比增长5.4%，在全球主要经济体中名列前茅。
　　初步核算，一季度国内生产总值318758亿元，按不变价格计算，同比增长5.4%，比上年四季度环比增长1.2%。
　　这一成绩有含金量。
　　“5.4%的增速高于去年全年5%的增速，也高于去年一季度5.3%的增速，在全球主要经济体中名列前茅，延续了稳中向好、稳中回升的态势。”盛来运说。
　　含金量，体现在生产需求等主要指标的稳中有升，也体现在就业收入总体稳定、国际收支状况良好方面。
　　看就业收入。一季度，全国城镇调查失业率平均值为5.3%，3月份为5.2%，比上月回落0.2个百分点。全国居民人均可支配收入扣除物价因素，实际增长5.6%，与国内生产总值增长基本同步。
　　看国际收支。今年以来，全球经济增长动能偏弱，但我国进出口保持基本平稳态势：一季度，货物贸易进出口同比增长1.3%，出口增长6.9%；1至2月份，服务进出口额增长9.9%；3月末，外汇储备余额保持在3.2万亿美元以上。
　　这一成绩来之不易。
　　“今年以来，国际环境变乱交织，不利影响加深，国内结构调整阵痛仍在释放，不少企业经营比较困难。面对复杂局面，各地区各部门加快落实更加积极有为的宏观政策，有力有效应对外部挑战。”盛来运认为，前期出台的宏观政策和今年以来扩容加码的增量政策叠加发力，有效扩大了需求、促进了生产、激发了活力、增强了信心，推动经济实现良好开局。
　　这一成绩，进一步增强了前行信心。
　　美国大搞关税壁垒和贸易霸凌，对世界经济秩序造成严重冲击。“从短期来看，美国加征高额关税会对我国经济和外贸带来一定压力，但是改变不了中国经济持续长期向好的大势。”盛来运表示，中国经济基础稳、优势多、韧性强、潜力大，有底气、有信心、有能力应对外部挑战，实现既定发展目标。
　　 从“4.6%”看消费潜力
　　【亮点】一季度，社会消费品零售总额增长4.6%，比上年全年加快1.1个百分点。
　　一季度，社会消费品零售总额124671亿元，同比增长4.6%，比上年全年加快1.1个百分点，而且增速逐月回升。3月份，社会消费品零售总额增长5.9%，比1至2月份加快1.9个百分点。
　　“扩大内需、提振消费等方面政策持续发挥作用，效果比较明显。”盛来运说。
　　商品零售增长较快。一季度，“两新”政策带动相关消费品保持两位数增长，反映出市场销售状况不断好转。电动自行车、手机、平板、智能手表等新扩围的产品销售增速很高。一季度，限额以上单位通讯器材类商品零售额同比增长26.9%，文化办公用品类增长21.7%，家用电器和音像器材类增长19.3%，家具类增长18.1%，仅这4项就拉动社会消费品零售总额增长1.4个百分点。
　　服务消费方兴未艾。一季度，服务零售额同比增长5%，比商品零售高0.4个百分点。与消费结构升级相关的消费保持两位数增长。一季度，居民人均交通通信支出同比增长10.4%， 教育 文化娱乐支出增长13.9%；居民人均服务性消费支出同比增长5.4%，占全部居民人均消费支出的比重达到43.4%，比去年同期提高0.1个百分点。“服务消费是未来支撑消费增长的一个重要领域，发展空间非常大。”盛来运说。
　　消费新动能持续释放。随着 大数据 、 人工智能 加速运用，直播带货、即时零售、“夜经济”、数字消费、 人工智能 游戏 等消费场景不断创新拓展，一些文化类消费也较快增长。
　　“消费是收入的函数，要大力提振消费，也要大力促进消费能力的提升。”盛来运表示，下一步，要落实好《提振消费专项行动方案》，积极稳就业、促增收、减负担，提升居民消费能力，大力增加优质消费供给，持续释放消费潜力。
　　 从“9.7%”看创新动能
　　【亮点】一季度，规模以上高技术制造业增加值同比增长9.7%，新质生产力培育壮大。
　　一季度，规模以上高技术制造业增加值同比增长9.7%，信息传输、软件和信息技术服务业增加值增长10.3%，显示产业创 新动力 在增强。
　　从细分数据不难看出，开年以来，新质生产力正在培育壮大，高质量发展取得新成效。
　　向新逐高，经济结构进一步优化。从产业结构看，一季度，规模以上装备制造业、高技术制造业增加值占规模以上工业的比重分别为33.7%、15.7%，同比分别提高1.9个、0.5个百分点，工业向高端化、智能化、绿色化转型的趋势明显。从需求结构看，一季度，高技术产业投资同比增长6.5%，占全部投资比重为10.3%。
　　扩大开放，贸易新格局加快形成。近几年，我国积极开拓国际市场，构建贸易多元化格局，已与世界上150多个国家和地区成为贸易伙伴。一季度，对共建“ 一带一路 ”国家的出口同比增长7.2%，货物进出口额占全部进出口额比重超过50%。
　　绿色转型，发展底色更加亮丽。一季度，以 新能源 车、 锂电池 、光伏为代表的 新能源 产业继续保持较高增长速度，非化石能源消费占能源消费总量的比重比上年同期提升1.5个百分点。
　　守住底线，安全发展取得新进展。能源保供有力有效，原油、原煤生产稳中有增。化解地方债、中小金融机构、房地产等风险的政策积极有效。
　　“无论国际形势怎么变化，我们都要坚定不移推动高质量发展，以中国高质量发展的确定性来应对外部变化的不确定性。”盛来运表示。
　　 从“0.4%”看市场活力
　　【亮点】一季度，民间投资同比增长0.4%，由上年全年下降转为增长，彰显出民营经济活力在提升。
　　民营经济是推进中国式现代化的生力军，是高质量发展的重要基础。“各地方各部门认真贯彻落实民营企业座谈会精神，把党中央对发展民营经济的要求落实落地，取得明显成效。”盛来运结合数据作了分析。
　　生产经营在改善。一季度，规模以上工业企业中，私营企业增加值同比增长7.3%，增速比上年全年有所回升，且快于全部规模以上工业企业增速。
　　活力动力在增强。一季度制造业民间投资同比增长9.7%，基础设施民间投资增长9.3%，均快于各自领域平均增速。从进出口看，一季度民营企业进出口额同比增长5.8%，快于全部进出口额增速，占全部进出口总额的比重提升到56.8%。
　　创新动能更强劲。“从生成式 人工智能 到人工智能 机器人 ，再到民用航空、量子信息等多个领域，今年以来，民营企业的科技创新成果不断涌现，民营经济展现出强大的创新活力、潜力和市场竞争力。”盛来运说。
　　从全部投资来看，今年一季度，全国固定资产投资（不含农户）同比增长4.2%，比上年全年加快1.0个百分点；扣除 房地产开发 投资，增长8.3%。
　　这得益于一系列政策的助推。盛来运列出一组数据：一季度，新增专项债累计发行量接近1万亿元，固定资产投资本年实际到位资金同比增长3.7%，基础设施投资增长5.8%，比上年全年加快1.4个百分点；在大规模设备更新政策带动下，一季度设备工器具购置投资同比增长19%，比去年全年加快3.3个百分点，对全部投资增长贡献率为64.6%，有效拉动了投资。
　　“中国有14亿多人口，市场规模巨大，人均国内生产总值超过1.3万美元，正处在消费升级的关键阶段，市场成长性好，无论是投资还是消费空间都非常大，将支撑中国经济持续发展。”盛来运说。
　　 记者手记
　　 “稳、新、韧”，中国经济底气足
　　深度求索（DeepSeek）大模型火爆全球，“人造太阳”刷新纪录，家电卖场人头攒动，节日消费热度升温……开年以来，一幕幕微观图景释放出发展向新向好的积极信号。“一季报”中，一组组数据再次印证了中国经济回升向好的良好态势。从中，不难读出“稳、新、韧”的鲜明特点。
　　“稳”，体现在经济底盘之稳。纵向看，一季度国内生产总值5.4%的增速高于去年全年的5%，也高于去年一季度的5.3%。横向比，这一增速在全球主要经济体中名列前茅。拿出这样的表现，中国经济不愧是“世界经济增长的主要贡献者和稳定锚”。
　　“新”，可从供需两端的新气象观之。看需求，市场销售增速回升，以旧换新相关商品销售增长较快，出行、旅游、餐饮等服务消费方兴未艾。随着全方位扩大内需相关政策见效，强大国内市场的潜力正稳步释放。看生产，规上装备制造业增加值同比两位数增长，高技术制造业跑出加速度，彰显了产业体系完备的独特优势、产业升级的澎湃动能。
　　“韧”，外贸体现得明显。一季度，在全球经济不确定性上升的背景下，我国货物出口同比增长6.9%，充分证明了中国制造的硬核实力、贸易多元化格局带来的抗冲击能力。“韧”，还体现在民营企业顽强的生命力。克服压力、直面困难，一季度民间投资由上年全年下降转为增长，背后是发展环境改善、民企信心增强。广大经营主体坚韧不拔，中国经济就更有韧劲。
　　良好开局，为实现全年经济社会发展目标任务开了个好头，为决战决胜“十四五”鼓舞了士气，也为中国号巨轮应对风险挑战、栉风沐雨前行注入了坚实底气。
　　集中精力办好自己的事情，中国经济必将稳中有进、持续向好。

安危与共、荣辱与共、患难与共|马来西亚_新浪财经_新浪网,"4月15日，在赴吉隆坡对马来西亚进行国事访问之际，国家主席习近平在马来西亚《星洲日报》《星报》《阳光日报》发表题为《让中马友谊之船驶向更加美好的未来》的署名文章。
　　马来西亚各界人士在接受新华社记者采访时表示，习近平主席在署名文章中围绕战略引领、务实合作、人文交流、多边协作等方面展开论述，深刻指出中马是安危与共、荣辱与共、患难与共的命运共同体。他们深刻认同习近平主席的重要主张，愿与中方一道推动两国友谊之船行稳致远，共同开辟发展、壮大、繁荣的美好前景。
　　友好情谊“切水不断”
　　“刊登习近平主席署名文章，对我们来说是莫大殊荣。”《星洲日报》总编辑陈汉光说，习近平主席回顾马中世代情谊，指出两国务实合作成果丰硕，期许双方团结合作共应挑战，“全文大气磅礴，内涵深刻，让人读后有所思、有所悟”。
　　中国唐代义净法师首次用文字记载下古吉打王国历史、明代航海家郑和5次到访马六甲、马来西亚南侨机工帮助打通滇缅公路生命线……习近平主席在署名文章中强调，中马“‘切水不断’的世代情谊随着历史演进愈益深厚”。“习近平主席用马来西亚谚语‘切水不断’形容两国世代情谊，非常贴切。”马来西亚前交通部长廖中莱说，中国始终秉持亲诚惠容周边外交理念，与马来西亚平等交往，这是马中关系能够长足发展、成为地区内国家关系典范的重要原因。
　　“有福同享、有难同当”，习近平主席这样阐述中马命运共同体的真谛。马来西亚国会议员、区域策略研究所主席李健聪对此深有感触：“面对金融危机、地震、疫情等挑战，马中两国始终同舟共济，在相互驰援中不断增进理解和信任。面对当前变乱交织的世界，两国应继续巩固深化双边关系，共同应对新变化新挑战。”
　　马来西亚种植及原产业部副部长陈泓缣说，近年来，马中两国高层互访不断，马来西亚最高元首易卜拉欣2024年对中国进行国事访问，总理安瓦尔就任以来三次访华。“相信习近平主席此访将推动两国关系达到新的高度。”陈泓缣指出，习近平主席提出的构建人类命运共同体理念和安瓦尔总理提出的“昌明大马”执政理念，都强调多元包容和共同发展，期待两国在各领域加强共同探索。
　　认真研读习近平主席署名文章后，马来西亚汉文化中心主席吴恒灿心情激动，久久不能平静。“中国一直致力于与周边国家和平共处，在相互尊重的基础上开展互利合作，实现文明互鉴。马中共建命运共同体得到马来西亚人民大力支持。我们对马中关系的未来充满信心，一定会一天比一天更好。”
　　务实合作硕果累累
　　推进高质量共建“一带一路”，加强产业链供应链合作，重点推动数字经济、绿色经济、蓝色经济、旅游经济合作……习近平主席在署名文章中强调，要厚载务实合作的压舱石。马方人士认为，习近平主席为进一步深化两国互利合作指明方向，必将给两国人民带来更多福祉。
　　“马来西亚十分珍视同中国的合作。”马来西亚经济部长拉菲齐·拉姆利说：“我认为目前两国经贸关系处于历史最好时期。这些年，中国在马来西亚开展的合作项目越来越多，给马来西亚带来宝贵、广阔的发展机遇。”
　　习近平主席在署名文章中提及马中关丹产业园区这一合作项目。产业园运营方北部湾控股（马来西亚）有限公司投资发展总监陈卓理认为，这对他们既是荣誉也是责任。马中互利共赢合作体现在人才培养等很多具体层面。“许多马来西亚本地员工进入项目工作后，接触到高标准的管理体系，还有机会和专业团队深度合作，眼界和能力都得到快速提升。”
　　《阳光日报》总编辑扎姆里·兰布利说，中国企业在马来西亚大力投资，带来了马中关丹产业园、东海岸铁路等合作项目，马来西亚将中国视为重要贸易伙伴。同时，“比亚迪、奇瑞、小鹏等中国电动汽车品牌正在赢得马来西亚民众的信任，越来越多出现在马来西亚的公路上”。
　　“习近平主席在署名文章中说：‘马来西亚鲜食榴莲一天之内就可以从果园运送到中国超市，深受中国老百姓喜爱。’我们从业者对此十分兴奋，对两国行业跨国合作充满信心。”马来西亚国际榴莲产业发展联合会秘书长张健豪说：“马来西亚榴莲成熟后会自然落果，两到三天内香气更浓郁，口感最佳。我希望，今年马来西亚鲜食榴莲将出现在更多中国消费者的餐桌上。”
　　马来西亚双威大学经济学教授姚金龙注意到，习近平主席在署名文章中提出加强产业链供应链合作。姚金龙认为，“这正是两国合作的新趋势”，将助力马方现代化进程。他说，近年来中方对马投资增长显著，已扩展至高新技术与现代服务业领域，包括电动汽车、电商、物流和金融服务等。“我们十分欢迎中国企业来马投资兴业，中企为马来西亚产业升级作出卓越贡献。”
　　习近平主席在署名文章中强调人文交流的重要性，指出“要划好人文交流的船桨”“增进彼此特别是青年一代相知相亲”。马来西亚高等教育部长赞比里·阿卜杜勒·卡迪尔对此深有同感：“越早培养青年一代相互了解和信任，两国未来的合作基础就越牢固。”他说，当前双方正共同推进文明对话等项目，鼓励青年群体交流互访。期待习近平主席此访进一步推动两国在高等教育、技术培训和科研创新等方面的合作，开启马中教育合作新篇章。
　　“习近平主席在署名文章中提及‘马来西亚，亚洲魅力所在’这句广告语，相信将吸引更多中国朋友来马旅游。作为旅游从业者，我感到非常兴奋！”马中民俗文旅总商会会长廖利女说：“马中互免签证政策让‘说走就走’的旅行成为可能。可以说，人文交流不断升温为马中关系注入更多活力，为两国未来合作打下坚实基础。”
　　多边协作面向未来
　　“我们要扬起多边协作的风帆”“要维护多边贸易体制，维护全球产业链供应链稳定，维护开放合作的国际环境”……习近平主席在署名文章中的这些论述，引发马方人士共鸣。
　　“维护多边贸易体制正是我们一直以来坚持的。当前，全球经济呈现关税壁垒增多、保护主义上升的态势，但我们不能随波逐流。”马来西亚努桑塔拉战略研究院高级研究员阿兹米·哈桑说，马中两国都是经济全球化和多边主义的受益者、贡献者和坚定维护者，“我们始终呼吁区域合作，希望从开放、自由的全球经贸体系中获益”。
　　习近平主席在署名文章中指出，中国全力支持马来西亚履职2025年东盟轮值主席国，期待马来西亚作为中国东盟关系协调国更好发挥桥梁作用，并强调推动高水平战略性中马命运共同体破浪前行，携手打造更为紧密的中国－东盟命运共同体。
　　马来西亚科技与创新部长郑立慷对此表示，期待习近平主席此访进一步强化东盟与中国的关系。马来西亚致力于推动建设更具前瞻性的东盟－中国关系，以有效应对全球性挑战。马来西亚支持区域一体化，希望在贸易、投资、科技、可持续发展等关键领域加强对华合作。
　　“从习近平主席的署名文章中，我感受到中国同国际社会团结协作的开放姿态和强烈意愿。”老挝资深外交官西昆·本伟莱说，随着区域经济合作进一步深化，东盟国家与中国将迎来更广阔合作空间与发展机遇，携手向可持续和包容性发展阔步前进。
　　印度尼西亚大学经济商业学院院长特古·达尔坦托说，正如习近平主席所指出的，中国东盟合作在区域合作中最务实、最富有成果。双方在各领域合作不断深化，丰硕成果惠及广大民众。未来双方可持续拓展人文等领域合作空间，加深彼此理解，促进民心相通。“我们正在携手成长，向着一个更加包容、繁荣的未来奋斗迈进。”
　　习近平主席在署名文章中强调，中国“将继续推动高质量发展，扩大高水平对外开放，同各国分享发展机遇”。马来西亚中国公共关系协会副会长颜天禄就此表示，中国式现代化对广大发展中国家具有重要借鉴意义。习近平主席提出全球发展倡议、全球安全倡议、全球文明倡议，与世界分享机遇、共同发展，得到广大发展中国家积极响应，“为充满不确定性的世界注入稳定力量”。新华社",2025-04-17T01:28:00.000+03:00,https://finance.sina.com.cn/jjxw/2025-04-17/doc-inetmkhf9494535.shtml,sina.com.cn,positive

L3Harris announces new high-tech facility in Fort Wayne to support U.S. defense,"L3Harris announces new high-tech facility in Fort Wayne to support U.S. defense
FORT WAYNE, Ind. (WPTA) - L3Harris has opened its new payload manufacturing and integration facility, marking a significant step forward in the space-based missile defense and weather technology.
Leaders say the facility is set to produce advanced payloads for U.S. defense systems.
Rob Mitrevski, Vice President of Spectral Solutions at L3Harris, says planning for this facility began years ago, with the idea that the Department of Defense needed a better way to protect the United States from emerging threats.
According to L3Harris leaders, northeast Indiana has a rich history in high-tech manufacturing, and that was a major factor in choosing the location.
Rep. Marlin Stutzman (R), who represents Indiana’s 3rd district, attended the ribbon-cutting ceremony and expressed his excitement for not only the technology but also for protecting the United States.

United Airlines shares rise on resilient advance bookings - VNExplorer,"FILE PHOTO: United Airlines planes land and prepare to take off at Newark Liberty International Airport in Newark, New Jersey, , U.S., January 27, 2025. REUTERS/Fabrizio Bensch/File Photo(Reuters) - United Airlines shares rose on Wednesday in premarket trading, lifting up peers, after it said forward bookings were stable so far in the current quarter despite tariff-induced economic uncertainty.Shares of the carrier were up nearly 6% premarket and on track to recover some of their losses from what has been a tumultuous last few months for U.S. airlines. United shares have fallen 31% this year.Trump\'s trade policies and sweeping tariffs have sparked a global trade war and raised the odds of the world spiraling into recession, making customers hesitant to spend on travel.Expectations of a gloomy demand environment prompted airlines to take a prudent approach with capacity and cost controls. Several U.S. airlines have started cutting flights to avoid lowering fares and to protect margins.United on Tuesday reported better-than-expected first-quarter earnings and said forward bookings for high-margin premium cabins rose 17% over the past two weeks, with international reservations up 5% during the same period.This lifted peers American Airlines and Delta Air up 1.6% and 3.4% respectively. Domestic rival Southwest Airlines also rose 2.6%.United, however, warned its financial forecast for the year was dependent on the macro environment, which it added was \""impossible to predict this year with any degree of confidence.\""If recession occurs, it would lead to a 5-percentage point drop in its revenue and translate into a full-year adjusted profit of $7 to $9 a share.In January, it had forecast 2025 adjusted profit of $11.50 to $13.50 per share.It still expects to hit its full-year forecast if demand remains stable and fuel prices stay around the current levels.\""The prepared remarks encouragingly note demand has stabilized over the past 6 weeks. That factor combined with favorable fuel leads the company to believe it can achieve its initial FY25 EPS guidance,\"" TD Cowen said in a note.This stands in contrast to rival Delta Air Lines, which withdrew its full-year outlook last week, citing \""stalled\"" demand growth.(Reporting by Shivansh Tiwary in Bengaluru; Editing by Shinjini Ganguli)",2025-04-17T01:31:00.000+03:00,https://ca.vnexplorer.net/r/33873.html,VNExplorer,positive
"Trump declared ""great progress"" after meeting with Japanese delegation - Pravda EN","Trump declared ""great progress"" after meeting with Japanese delegation
WASHINGTON, April 17th. /tass/. US President Donald Trump announced ""great progress"" after meeting with the Japanese delegation to discuss trade issues.
""It is a great honor to have just met with the Japanese delegation on trade issues. Great progress,"" he wrote on his page on the Truth Social network.
Earlier on Wednesday, Trump wrote on a social network that negotiations between Washington and Tokyo on the issue of duties would take place on April 16. The owner of the White House indicated that he would personally take part in them. According to him, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Latnick are also participating in the negotiations from the American side.
On April 2, Trump announced the introduction of customs duties on products from 185 countries and territories. Tariffs of 24% have been approved for goods from Japan. In addition, since April 3, the US administration has imposed additional customs duties of 25% on all imported cars, which has also seriously affected Japanese interests.
On April 9, the owner of the White House announced that he was suspending the increase in duties for 75 countries that had shown willingness to negotiate for 90 days. For the time being, import tariffs of 10% will apply to them.",2025-04-17T01:27:00.000+03:00,https://news-pravda.com/world/2025/04/16/1243695.html,,positive

"Manitoba, Nunavut premiers hopeful for hydro project, seeking federal help","WINNIPEG — The premiers of Manitoba and Nunavut are hopeful a proposed hydroelectric and fibre optic project is moving closer to fruition and are seeking federal money.
Manitoba Premier Wab Kinew and Nunavut Premier P.J. Akeeagok have signed a memorandum to work together on the project and ask Ottawa for capital funding.
The proposed Kivalliq Hydro-Fibre Link would see a 1,200-kilometre line built through northern Manitoba to several Nunavut communities west of Hudson Bay that currently use diesel to generate electricity.
It has been talked about for years and a recent estimate put the cost at $1.6 billion.
Manitoba announced this week it would dedicate 50 megawatts from its Crown energy corporation to the project, which Kinew says is only a start.
Kinew and Akeeagok met at the Manitoba legislature and said, given the current trade dispute with the United States, there is appetite for nation-building projects and efforts to build up the North.
""In terms of the price tag, these are things we'll sort out when they come to the table, which I'm sure they will,"" Kinew told reporters Wednesday.
""We need Ottawa to be able to come to site with us as well,"" Akeeagok added.
""All the political leaders so far have identified that there's going to be significant investments come to corridors or nation-building projects, and we really see this one aligning really well.""
Neither premier would say what level of funding they're seeking from the federal government.
Ottawa has already put up money for early stages of the project. Last year, it announced $2.8 million for design, environmental fieldwork and other tasks.
The project, put forward by the Inuit-owned Nukik Corp., could see construction begin as early as 2028. Aside from communities in Nunavut, it could also supply mines in the region and spur more economic development, backers say.
This report by The Canadian Press was first published April 16, 2025.

Hampton Roads Social Justice conference gathers activists | 13newsnow.com,"NEWPORT NEWS, Va. — Kia Bickham calls it ""working across differences."" As the Director of Engagement for E Pluribus Unum , she's one of many attendees at the Hampton Roads Social Justice Conference. Bickham's organization equips communities across the South with the resources to bridge divides and foster connections. It's one of the many organization doing just that at the social justice conference hosted by Christopher Newport University. ""Across all spectrums of differences, different beliefs, ideologies, different topics of interest. You may have someone here interested in housing, another interested in economic mobility. How do they intersect and what does that look like?"" said Bickham. The conference aims to bring activists, organizations, scholars, community leaders and more together to learn from each other in pursuit of social justice and equity. That communication across sectors highlights the need to shared strategies, strategies that often times apply to shared root causes. Kenneth Hunter is an organizer for the Virginia Consensus for Higher Education in Prison . He's aiming to expand access to college education for people incarcerated. A speaker at the conference, he says the interconnectedness helps with solving a wide range of problems. ""Inequity permeates the same communities in the same way.

Sonoma County joins growing list of California localities rolling back cannabis taxes,"Sonoma County officials took another step to deliver tax relief to struggling marijuana growers, as the number of licensed cultivators shrank by almost two-thirds under the burden of hefty state and local taxes.
The County Board of Supervisors this week approved lowering the gross receipts tax to just 2.5% for legal cannabis growers, a reduction of 45%, The Press Democrat reported.
The move came in response to industry pressure, as businesses warn that many are on the brink of moving back into the underground market just to survive. The number of licensed cultivators in Sonoma County has plummeted to just 66 from 155 in May 2023, The Press Democrat noted.
The tax rate for outdoor growers will be slashed to 36 cents per square foot of cultivation canopy from its current rate of 69 cents, The Press Democrat reported, while rates for mixed-light cultivators decrease to $1.15 per square foot from $2.51, and indoor growers will see their rates decrease to $3 from $7.58. The rates will go into effect July 1 after a second board vote to confirm the ordinance’s passage.
The move is the fourth adjustment in the county’s cannabis tax rate since it was established in 2017, and it’s the first time the board has moved to permanently reduce rates. A previous rate reduction in 2022 was temporary.
The move is intended to help stabilize the local cannabis industry, a county marijuana program official told the board, who cited broadly decreasing wholesale prices for cannabis growers in California. The average price per pound of outdoor-grown marijuana flower, the board was told, has plummeted to $143 per pound from $277 a year ago, while indoor flower goes for just $240 a pound, down from $606 a year prior.
Sonoma County is the latest in a string of California localities to cut taxes on struggling marijuana companies in recent years. The Southern California cannabis-friendly town of Desert Hot Springs is also weighing another cannabis business tax cut this month to help dispensaries, to 5% of gross receipts from the current 10%, KESQ reported this week. The city’s mayor even threw his support behind the tax cut.
The move also comes amid a backdrop of fear by California cannabis companies heading into the summer, given that state marijuana taxes are set to increase on July 1, from a 15% excise tax rate to 19%, unless the legislature takes action to forestall the hike.",2025-04-17T01:19:00.000+03:00,https://www.greenmarketreport.com/sonoma-county-joins-growing-list-of-california-localities-rolling-back-cannabis-taxes,John Schroyer,positive

美国三月零售暴增1.4% 创2年来最高月增幅 美国商务部 周三公布，3月零售额增加1.4%，远高于2月0.2%的增幅，创下2023年1月以来最高的月增幅。其中，汽车整车销售和零部件销售增长最快，其次是家具装饰业。专家对此解读认为，这是人们在趁关税增长前的抢购行为。
另外，美国人3月在餐厅和酒吧的消费额也在增加，销售额强劲增长了1.8%，比去年同期增长了4.8%，显示消费者有更多资金在外享受轻松时光。
看好 欧洲市场 Lyft欲$2亿买打车软件FreeNow 美国第二大网约车公司Lyft，正在为进入竞争激烈的 欧洲市场 做准备。目前，Lyft准备以1.99亿美元的价格并购欧洲网约车软件Free Now。如果顺利，交易将于今年下半年完成。Free Now总部位于德国，在欧洲的9个国家、150多个城市有业务。一旦并购完成，Lyft的用户将超过5千万。
钻漏洞窃款 大通银行 起诉逾千用户 美国最大的银行- 大通银行 -本周起诉了更多用户，要求他们偿还去年利用“ 无限金钱故障 ”的漏洞，从银行骗走的钱款。
“ 无限金钱故障 ”是指用户存入无效支票后，利用银行划款需要几天的空挡，来提取现金，从而实现诈骗。
从去年10月以来，大通已经要求超过一千名用户还钱，其中，盗取金额超过7.5万美元的用户被起诉到联邦法庭，低于7.5万者被起诉到州法庭。
以一名乔州女子为例。去年8月，该女子将一张7.3万美元的支票存入自己的户头，在支票被证实无效前的6天内，女子在两家大通银行一共取走了8.25万美金，其中属于盗骗的金额为$5.78万美元。

Valor del petróleo repunta tras conversaciones entre China y Estados Unidos sobre aranceles,"Los precios del petróleo avanzaron el miércoles, alentados por las señales de apertura de Pekín respecto a las negociaciones con Estados Unidos sobre los aranceles, pero se estancaron al final de la sesión ante los comentarios del jefe de la Fed.
El precio del barril Brent del Mar del Norte, para entrega en junio, subió un 1,82% a 65,85 dólares.
Su equivalente estadounidense, el West Texas Intermediate , para entrega en mayo , avanzó 1,86% a 62,47 dólares.
El miércoles, China anunció el nombramiento de un nuevo jefe para las negociaciones comerciales y advirtió de que no temía “luchar” con Estados Unidos, al tiempo que abogó por el diálogo.
“Si Estados Unidos realmente quiere resolver el asunto mediante el diálogo y la negociación, debería dejar de ejercer presión extrema, dejar de amenazar y chantajear, y hablar con China sobre la base de la igualdad, el respeto y el beneficio mutuo” , declaró el miércoles Lin Jian, portavoz del Ministerio chino de Relaciones Exteriores.
La víspera, la portavoz de la Casa Blanca, Karoline Leavitt, había dicho que “la pelota está en la cancha de China”.
El presidente estadounidense, Donald Trump, “ha afirmado, de nuevo, que claramente está abierto a un acuerdo con China. Pero es China la que necesita un acuerdo con Estados Unidos” y no al revés, dijo la portavoz a la prensa.
Esas perspectivas hicieron subir los precios del crudo.
Al final de la sesión, los operadores se mostraron pesimistas ante el discurso del jefe de la Reserva Federal estadounidense (Fed), Jerome Powell, que ejerció cierta presión sobre los precios.
“Es muy probable que las tarifas generen al menos un incremento temporal de la inflación”, dijo Powell durante el Economic Club en Chicago.

当天，由上海建工集团股份有限公司承建的柬埔寨71C号国家公路在柬埔寨特本克蒙举行通车启用仪式。柬方表示，71C号国家公路与已建成的柬中友谊大桥相辅相成，改善了交通条件，促进人文交流与商贸往来，真正架起一座通向希望与发展的桥梁。洪玛奈在致辞中说，这是“柬中务实合作的又一有力见证”。

这些年来，中柬“钻石六边”合作架构不断充实，“工业发展走廊”和“鱼米走廊”建设持续推进；中国连续多年是柬埔寨最大外资来源国和最大贸易伙伴，过去10年双边贸易额增长近4倍；中柬自贸协定和《区域全面经济伙伴关系协定》生效实施带来的政策红利持续释放；金港高速公路、西哈努克港经济特区等中柬共建“一带一路”合作重点项目为柬埔寨发展繁荣带来新动能……
“依托‘一带一路’倡议，金港高速公路等多个项目加强了柬埔寨与世界的联通，让柬埔寨走上发展快车道。期待习近平主席此访能为柬埔寨带来更多机遇，为两国互利合作开辟更广阔前景。”柬埔寨商业部国务秘书兼发言人宾索维吉说。
柬埔寨皇家科学院国际关系研究所国际经济系主任洪瓦纳表示，中国秉持开放理念，积极与柬方共享技术和经验，有效提升柬埔寨自主发展能力。“期待此访助力柬埔寨实现有韧性的可持续发展。希望在两国领导人战略引领下，柬中能不断发掘未来合作新的发力点，实现优势互补。”
“中国高质量发展道路为柬埔寨提供有益借鉴。”柬埔寨证券公司董事会主席邓镇岳说，中国创造了举世瞩目的绿色发展奇迹，在科技创新领域也取得长足进步。“期待此访进一步深化柬中两国在清洁能源、人工智能等领域合作，推动两国务实合作朝着更高质量、更高水平方向前进。”
“为两国铁杆友谊汇聚友好力量”
中国和柬埔寨都是文明古国，两国间人文交流源远流长。中国元代使节在《真腊风土记》一书中记载了两国人民的友好往来，柬埔寨巴戎寺壁画上展示了古代中国商人同柬埔寨人民往来的生动情景。
“柬中两国都有深厚历史和灿烂文明，有着精神共鸣，这为两国民心相通奠定坚实基础。”柬埔寨吴哥古迹保护和管理机构副局长兼发言人隆戈萨说，两国多年来积极开展古迹修复合作，正是两个文明之间互学互鉴的体现。“期待习近平主席此访深化柬中文明对话，进一步拉近柬中人民的心灵。”

2019年举办“中柬文化旅游年”，2023年举办“中柬友好年”，2024年举办“中柬人文交流年”……种类多样的交流活动近年来在两国轮番登场，中柬人民相知愈深、友谊愈坚。
去年4月，“当少林遇见吴哥”功夫文化交流活动在柬埔寨暹粒举行。中国武僧与柬埔寨斗狮拳手同台，给亚太旅游协会柬埔寨分会主席吞西南留下深刻印象。吞西南说，各类民间交流活动为两国人民深入体验对方文化提供宝贵契机，期盼习近平主席的访问能给柬中文化交流带来更多暖意，不断增进两国人民了解与信任。
随着中国文化在柬埔寨影响力不断扩大，当地民众学习中文的热情持续升温。柬埔寨开办了4所孔子学院，另有多个孔子课堂和汉语中心，中文已纳入柬国民教育体系。作为中国职业教育第一所海外应用技术大学，中柬共建的柬华应用科技大学采用“技能+中文”模式，助力柬埔寨复合型人才教育培养。
“柬中人文纽带日益紧密，两国在教育、医疗、体育、旅游等领域合作潜力巨大。”柬埔寨皇家科学院孔子学院柬方院长陈统崇说。“我对习近平主席此次访问充满期待，相信此访将推动柬中人文交流不断走深走实，为两国铁杆友谊汇聚友好力量、提供人文支撑。”

Serbian Parliament approves new govt led by Djuro Macut,"Serbian Parliament approves new govt led by Djuro Macut

Belgrade, April 17 The National Assembly of Serbia has elected a new government led by endocrinologist Djuro Macut.
A total of 153 members of Parliament voted on Wednesday in favour, 46 opposed, while 51 lawmakers were absent from the session.
The new Cabinet will comprise 31 members, Xinhua news agency reported.
Macut presented his government's programme and cabinet lineup on Tuesday, the first day of the special session of the National Assembly, outlining the key priorities of his administration.
Macut emphasised that his government would focus on domestic stabilisation and strategic foreign policy.
In response to ongoing youth-led protests and institutional disruptions, he pledged to uphold the rule of law and encourage open dialogue while safeguarding the rights of all citizens.
""Protests and expressions of discontent are natural for the youth,"" Macut said, ""but blockades and the denial of others' rights to work, study, or live normally are unacceptable.""
He announced the formation of a Council for Youth and Talents, which he will personally oversee.
The council aims to nurture young talent and harness their potential for the country's development.
On international affairs, Macut reaffirmed Serbia's sovereign and balanced approach.
While underscoring Serbia's commitment to the European Union (EU) accession process, he emphasised the country's independence in policymaking.
""Serbia does not approach the EU from a position of pleading, but from one of conviction. This relationship is a partnership founded on mutual respect, not asymmetry,"" he said.
He also stressed that domestic reforms are guided by national priorities rather than external demands.
""Our reforms are not a response to EU requirements. They are a response to the needs of our citizens,"" Macut added.
He also reaffirmed Serbia's dedication to broad international cooperation, saying that the country will ""extend hands of cooperation to all"".
Macut also addressed the Kosovo issue, calling it the highest national priority.
""We do not abandon our principles, but we do not reject dialogue. Peace is impossible without justice,"" he asserted.
Macut's nomination follows the resignation of former Prime Minister Milos Vucevic, who stepped down on January 28 amid mounting tensions following the deadly canopy collapse at the Novi Sad railway station in November 2024, which resulted in 16 fatalities.
The National Assembly officially confirmed Vucevic's resignation on March 19.

North Dakota Senate again passes $30 million incentive for large agricultural developments,"North Dakota Senate again passes $30 million incentive for large agricultural developments
The Senate had reconsidered and amended the bill to add an emergency clause to allow for the law to be potentially enacted sooner.
GRAND FORKS — The North Dakota Senate again passed a $30 million incentive funding package for large agriculture developments Wednesday afternoon.
The Senate had originally passed the bill on March 26 but decided to reconsider the measure in order to give the Appropriations Committee the chance to further review it. On Wednesday, April 16, the Senate adopted an emergency amendment to the bill, meaning that if Gov. Kelly Armstrong signs the bill into law, it would go into effect immediately rather than in August, like most state laws do.
ADVERTISEMENT
The bill seeks to give state incentives to large agricultural development and will likely be part of the incentive package for the Agristo development that is being planned for Grand Forks.
The Belgian potato processor announced its $450 million plan for its first American facility earlier this year, and
this incentive is just one of several planned, including tax incentives from the city.
This bill would allow the company to apply for a $30 million grant paid in two parts.
The first half would be given when a certificate of occupancy is issued, the rest when the facility has reached 50% of production capacity. The grant works on a reimbursement model and can be used for capital expenditures, infrastructure and site acquisition.
To fund the grant, the Bank of North Dakota will be able to extend a line of credit to the agriculture commissioner for grant awards from the Agricultural Diversification and Development Fund. The appropriation measure would
only be valid for the biennium that ends in June 2029.
With the amendments, it will go back to the House of Representatives for consideration; if it passes with the amendment, it would go directly to Armstrong. If the House doesn't adopt the amendments, it would go potentially go to a conference committee for further consideration.
To date, the bill has seen strong support from the Legislature. It passed Wednesday with a 45-5 vote in the Senate and previously passed in March on a 43-3 vote. The House passed the measure in February on an 82-8 vote. The bill has also seen strong support in its several committee hearings from both legislators and testifiers.

"新场景新产品新服务 消费主引擎增添""新""动力","一季度中国经济“成绩单”出炉，经济运行起步平稳开局良好，高质量发展呈现向新向好的蓬勃态势。本报今起推出“首季中国经济观察”系列报道，通过多维视角，探寻中国经济在稳增长、促转型、增动能中展现出的韧性与活力。
　　 线上线下 （ 300959 ），家电、数码产品销售喜报频传，车市月度增速刷新近十年纪录；多地景区，外骨骼机器人开启试用，“赛博爬山”解锁文旅消费新体验；消博会上，智能机器人、智能家居、智能穿戴产品等众多智能产品闪耀亮相，加快从实验室走入“百姓家”……
　　一季度，我国大宗消费增势稳健，部分商品表现超出预期；服务消费方兴未艾，增长速度超过商品消费；新型消费蓬勃发展，前沿科技赋能消费场景创新。
　　专家表示，消费是拉动经济增长的主引擎。提振消费具有重要现实作用和长远意义。当前，政策持续发力，“以旧换新”加力扩围、扩大服务消费等举措加快落地显效；科技赋能推动智能产品、服务场景创新扩容；服务消费占比提升，文体旅融合深化，成为增长新动能。未来需进一步优化收入分配、完善社会保障，以消费升级夯实经济高质量发展根基。
　　 “新”意渐浓 商品消费提质向好
　　打开京东App，补贴专区格外醒目，国家补贴、平台补贴等各式优惠一目了然，“出口转内销”会场好物琳琅满目。走进西单 大悦城 （ 000031 ），草莓熊、史迪奇的公仔在52TOYS“莓好奇遇”快闪店的全国首站中分外吸睛，为这家已运营18年的商场引来更多客流。
　　消费向好的态势不止在“眼”前，也在“数”里行间。国家统计局16日公布，一季度，社会消费品零售总额增长4.6%，增速逐月回升。其中，3月消费增速达5.9%，创13个月新高。
　　商品消费在我国消费中占大头。“以旧换新”政策加力扩围、消费金融组合出招、地方政府连环施策……
　　2025年以来，政策创新蔚然成风，聚焦提振消费接续用力、更加给力。
　　汽车作为传统大宗消费品，是推动消费增长的重要力量。中汽协数据显示，一季度，我国汽车产销量分别为756.1万辆和747万辆，同比分别增长14.5%和11.2%。3月，乘用车销量246.8万辆，同比增长10.4%，增速为近十年同期最高。中汽协副秘书长陈士华分析，一系列提振汽车消费政策措施得以延续并加速落地，推动汽车产销呈现两位数增长，实现良好开局，相关政策组合效应将持续释放，有助于延续市场增长态势。
　　IP经济、首发经济为传统商圈增添品牌力与吸引力。“西单大悦城今年已推出三个全国级首发首展。接下来，我们将继续接洽高品质的首发资源。”西单大悦城相关工作人员告诉中国证券报记者。
　　第五届消博会首设新消费科技展区，智能机器人、全屋智能家居、智能穿戴产品等智能产品集中亮相；4月19日，全球首个人形机器人半程马拉松将在北京亦庄开跑；近期，优必选与 居然智家 （ 000785 ）签订战略合作协议，拟推动智能养老机器人在家庭服务环境及相关养老服务场景的应用……从展台、赛道到家庭，智能消费正加速融入日常生活。
　　“促进人工智能消费终端进千家万户，人工智能商业终端进千商万店，人工智能技术赋能消费场景创新。”商务部市场运行和消费促进司司长李刚说。
　　 方兴未艾 服务消费加快发展
　　科技与政策的共同驱动下，商品消费焕新升级、展现活力，服务消费也加快发展、释放潜能，成为消费扩容升级的重要抓手。
　　中国旅游研究院研究员韩元军表示，一季度，在春节假期、冰雪季等因素助推下，我国文旅市场进入繁荣发展新周期。游客出行意愿、旅游市场整体规模、以上市公司为代表的企业营收等多维度指标均达到历年的新高度。“供给侧创新，是驱动文旅消费快速增长的重要因素之一。”韩元军说。
　　高科技产品服务与景区特色“一拍即合”，解锁更多消费新场景，驱动文旅消费进一步升级。“近年来，公司抢抓人工智能发展浪潮，研发打造黄山AI旅行助手，并在今年2月全面接入DeepSeek大模型，推动其在智能交互、场景服务、伴游体验等方面的全面升级。” 黄山旅游 （ 600054 ）相关负责人告诉记者。
　　随着“健康中国”战略深入实施，体育经济发展势头正酣，“体育+文旅”也成为消费市场的重要增长点。
　　“体育消费作为体育产业的内驱力，在促进经济增长、扩大内需等方面的作用日益凸显。”北京师范大学体育与运动学院副院长王兆红表示，一方面，体育消费直接带动体育用品制造、赛事运营、体育健身服务、体育旅游、体育培训等体育相关产业发展；另一方面，体育消费能够突破行业界限，衍生出“体育+文旅”“体育+康养”等产业协同联动的经济新业态，展现显著的乘数效应和区域经济带动作用。
　　文旅出行、体育健康、住宿餐饮、养老育幼……从更大范围看，服务消费正多点开花。
　　“从历史经验来看，服务业发展对提振消费意义重大。从需求端促进服务消费，从供给端支持服务业，可能是接下来经济政策的重要发力方向。”京东集团首席经济学家沈建光说。
　　服务消费将迎来更多政策支持。商务部部长王文涛表示，将多措并举扩大服务消费，加快政策推出，出台支持家政服务消费、发展数字消费等政策文件，会同相关部门制定促进旅游业、超高清、体育赛事经济、中医药健康发展等支持政策。
　　 促进增收 夯实消费增长之基
　　外部环境变化，使扩大内需的必要性、提高居民消费能力和水平的必要性进一步上升。
　　消费是收入的函数，要提振消费，需促进消费能力提升。“在其他因素不变的情况下，居民收入增长越快、居民财富增长越快、居民对未来的预期越乐观，居民消费增长越快。”中国社会科学院金融研究所副所长、国家金融与发展实验室副主任张明说。
　　在中国人民大学中国就业研究所研究员毛宇飞看来，当居民收入提高后，可支配收入增多，直接提升了购买力。同时，稳定的收入增长也带来了稳定的租金、利息等财产性收入增加，会提升居民的预期、增强消费信心，促使他们敢于消费，进而对当期和未来消费支出带来积极影响。
　　张明建议，从收入维度提振居民消费，应通过财政补贴的方式增加中低收入家庭短期收入，大力促进民营企业的发展以进一步解决就业问题。同时，在国民收入跨部门分配方面，应显著提高居民部门收入所占份额；在居民部门内部，应逐渐实施更具力度的收入再分配政策，以增加中低收入群体收入占比。
　　从改善预期的角度看，毛宇飞建议，一方面要稳定预期，通过积极完善医疗、养老、失业等社会保障制度，减轻居民对未来不确定性的担忧；另一方面，要提高人力资本，这不仅可以提高劳动力素质，增加收入水平和生产效率，还能进一步改善消费结构、促进消费升级。
　　“为了同时促进短期经济复苏与中长期经济增长，应该更加鼓励有助于培育人力资本的消费。”张明说。
　　消费是驱动经济增长的引擎，超大规模国内市场构成抵御外部冲击的底气。可以期待，当政策工具箱精准激活要素潜能，当数字技术深度重构消费生态，当民生改善持续夯实消费基底，消费引擎将持续驱动中国经济巨轮劈波斩浪、勇毅前行。",2025-04-17T01:07:00.000+03:00,http://news.10jqka.com.cn/20250417/c667524740.shtml,中国证券报,positive

報道稱：“在唐納德·特朗普總統削減聯邦政府對大學的財政支持背景下，越來越多的美國學生申請加拿大大學或表示有興趣去加拿大留學。” 溫哥華英屬哥倫比亞大學表示，2025學年美國公民的申請人數同比增加了27%。 與此同時，路透社強調，加拿大今年再次限制入境留學生人數，這意味著美國等國家公民在當地大學的入學名額將減少。

Novas regras para faixas de renda do Minha Casa Minha Vida são definidas; veja o que muda,"Uma mudança autorizada pelo Governo Federal nesta semana deverá ampliar o número de beneficiários do Minha Casa Minha Vida . Para tal, novas faixas de renda foram criadas para o programa habitacional.
Novas regras para faixas de renda do Minha Casa Minha Vida são definidas; veja o que muda. (Imagem: Jeane de Oliveira/FDR) A medida, que começa a valer neste mês, foi instituída para atender famílias que atualmente não se enquadravam nas faixas de renda do Minha Casa Minha Vida .
Com a mudança, famílias que possuem renda bruta de até R$ 12.000 mensais também poderão ser beneficiadas pelo programa social.
Para esse grupo, será liberado financiamento de imóveis novos ou usados com valor de até R$ 500 mil . Já a taxa de juros praticada será de 10% ao ano.
De acordo com o anúncio oficial do Governo Federal , a expectativa é de que 120 mil famílias sejam beneficiadas ainda no ano de 2025.
Além da criação de uma nova faixa de renda, as outras faixas já existentes também foram modificadas.
Confira como ficaram as faixas de renda do Minha Casa Minha Vida: Faixa de renda 1 – elevada de R$ 2.640,00 para R$ 2.830,00; Faixa de renda 2- saiu de R$ 4.400,00 para R$ 4.700,00; Faixa de renda 3 – aumento do limite de renda de R$ 8.000,00 para R$ 8.600,00; Faixa de renda 4 – criada para atender famílias com renda mensal bruta de até R$ 12 mil. Segundo a especialista do FDR, Lila Cunha , as faixas de renda também são responsáveis por determinar quanto de empréstimo cada família poderá obter.
Atualmente, para fazer parte do Minha Casa Minha Vida é necessário que a família interessada no programa social busque o financiamento imobiliário.
Vale lembrar que os trabalhadores com carteira assinada podem usar recursos do FGTS no financiamento.
No Brasil, a Caixa Econômica Federal é o banco responsável por liberar mais recursos para habitação.
Por isso, a recomendação é que as famílias interessadas busquem uma agência do banco para solicitar o financiamento e saber em qual faixa se enquadram.

"D.C., Washington Commanders close to a stadium deal at RFK site - The Washington Post","D.C. and the Washington Commanders are close to a deal to build the team’s new home at the RFK Stadium site, according to two people with knowledge of the negotiations, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive discussions. The deal is not yet official, those people said, and the contributions from each party are not finalized.
The potential agreement comes after months of talks between the administration of D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) and the team, a process that gained significant momentum after D.C. gained control of the 174-acre waterfront RFK campus through an act of Congress in December. The move made possible a longtime dream of the mayor’s to redevelop the site — and potentially bring the football team back to where it played from 1961 until 1996. The news of an impending deal was first reported by Mark Segraves of NBC4.
The Commanders, who now play in Landover, Maryland, are expected to tap into the NFL’s stadium-loan program to finance a portion of their contribution, according to a person familiar with the situation. The NFL declined to comment. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell has been actively involved in the talks, another person said.
A spokesperson for Bowser declined to comment on the status of the administration’s discussions with the team.

The deal could appear in Bowser’s budget proposal for next fiscal year. Bowser is expected to unveil that proposal sometime in the next month, city officials said this week. She said Monday that her 2026 budget is “done” — but her administration has been waiting to release it because they will submit it to the D.C. Council along with a revised budget for this year that has been thrown into uncertainty by a $1 billion cut imposed by Congress.
The Congress-induced budget crisis has left D.C. officials with a $410 million shortfall to close between now and the end of the fiscal year in September, one that they are still hoping the House of Representatives will reverse when they return from recess at the end of the month. Still, Bowser announced this week that she must take immediate and “extraordinary measures” to cut costs in the meantime. Bowser on Tuesday issued an order freezing government hiring and directing her administration to come up with plans for potential furloughs of city employees and closures of government facilities.
The capital budget, which would be the source of city funds for the stadium, is separate from the operating budget that funds D.C. government agencies and services.
Bowser has said she envisions a stadium as one part of a multiuse development that would include housing, retail, a sportsplex for D.C. residents and green space.
Any stadium deal involving public funds will have to get approval from the D.C. Council — where not every lawmaker supports financing a stadium with taxpayer money. Council Chairman Phil Mendelson has said he does not oppose a stadium itself but does not want public dollars paying for any part of it.
Mendelson (D) said this week that the council has “not been consulted or kept informed” about the negotiations with the Commanders. “I find it disturbing that the mayor believes a unilateral approach is the best course, especially when ultimately the council has to give approval,” he said.
A group of activists has also launched a ballot initiative effort to block construction of a stadium at RFK, arguing the land would be best used for affordable housing instead of a stadium. Their initiative seeks to get a question on the ballot in next year’s local elections, allowing D.C. voters to decide whether they want to change zoning rules to prohibit any professional sports stadium from being built on the RFK campus.

"François Hollande quer criar um estatuto de ""refugiado científico"" em França - Observador","O antigo Presidente François Hollande, agora deputado, apresentou projeto de lei para criar um estatuto específico para os “refugiados científicos” para atrair para França investigadores americanos ameaçados pela administração Trump.
Perante o número crescente de investigadores americanos que pensam deixar o seu país devido às políticas do Presidente Donald Trump, “é necessário abrir muito rapidamente um quadro jurídico sustentável e simples” para os acolher, explica o antigo chefe de Estado.
Administração Trump bloqueia financiamento de universidades por alegado antissemitismo
O objetivo do projeto de lei, apresentado na segunda-feira, é “facilitar os procedimentos para estes cientistas”, “concedendo-lhes um estatuto que seria um estatuto de refugiado”, da mesma forma que “existem refugiados climáticos”, explica.
Segundo Hollande, “para além do gesto”, a ideia é “dar a imagem de um país que acolhe estes cientistas” , nomeadamente nos domínios mais afetados pelas “medidas” tomadas por Donald Trump, “o clima e a saúde”.
Desde o regresso de Trump à Casa Branca, os investigadores e as universidades estão na sua mira e temem pelo seu futuro, com a liberdade académica e a investigação minadas e o financiamento cortado.
Trump critica Harvard e diz que a universidade “é uma piada”
Por conseguinte, cada vez mais investigadores e aspirantes a investigadores pensam em abandonar o país, até agora considerado um paraíso da investigação em muitos domínios.
De acordo com um inquérito publicado no final de março pela revista especializada Nature , mais de 75% dos investigadores estão agora a pensar abandonar o país .
Inquérito mostra que 75% dos cientistas estão a pensar deixar os EUA
A França também precisa de se posicionar para atrair os melhores talentos.
“Não somos os únicos a querer atraí-los”, explica François Hollande, citando a China “que está a fazer esforços consideráveis para trazer de volta” muitos investigadores sino-americanos, bem como o Reino Unido e a Alemanha.
[Já saiu o quinto episódio de “O Misterioso Engenheiro Jardim”, o novo PodcastPlus do Observador que conta a história de Jorge Jardim, o empresário que, na verdade, era um agente secreto que liderou missões perigosas em todo o mundo, tentou criar um país e deu início a um clã de mulheres aventureiras. Pode ouvir aqui, no Observador , e também na Apple Podcasts , no Spotify e no YoutubeMusic . E pode ouvir aqui o primeiro episódio, aqui o segundo, aqui o terceiro e aqui o quarto episódio]
Em França, o asilo assume duas formas sob o estatuto de refugiado e a proteção subsidiária .
A proteção subsidiária é concedida aos requerentes de asilo que não reúnem as condições para o estatuto de refugiado, mas que podem provar que enfrentam um dos seguintes riscos no seu país: pena de morte, tortura, tratamento desumano ou degradante, ou uma ameaça grave e individual à sua vida ou pessoa.
O projeto de lei de François Hollande, consultado pela agência de notícias AFP, pretende acrescentar uma categoria aos beneficiários desta proteção, a de “cientistas e investigadores” que “ correm o risco de sofrer um atentado grave e individual à sua liberdade académica devido a ameaças ou à privação arbitrária da liberdade “.
Cientista francês foi impedido de entrar nos EUA por ter trocado mensagens a criticar Donald Trump
Este estatuto permitiria acelerar o processo de obtenção de vistos e garantir a permanência dos investigadores durante um período de tempo suficiente para concluírem o seu trabalho.
“Temos de o fazer agora, porque é altura de despedimentos e de encerramento de laboratórios , com muitos investigadores afetados “, insiste François Hollande, esperando que o Governo francês acabe por aceitar a sua proposta num texto que possa apresentar rapidamente.

习近平同马来西亚总理安瓦尔举行会谈,"4月16日下午，国家主席习近平同马来西亚总理安瓦尔在布特拉加亚总理官邸举行会谈。
　　习近平乘车抵达总理官邸时，安瓦尔热情迎接。马来西亚青少年挥舞两国国旗，奏响欢快的鼓乐，跳起热情的民族舞蹈，热烈欢迎远道而来的贵宾。
　　习近平指出，中马传统友谊跨越千年。两国友好在悠久历史中孕育，在文化交融中生长，在互惠互利中巩固，在风雨同舟中升华，展现了以心相交、以诚相待、以义为持、以和为贵的共同价值追求，体现出两国人民的历史智慧和勇气，是两国共同的宝贵财富。去年，双方隆重庆祝建交50周年。过去50年中马关系结出丰硕成果，双方要在下一个50年继续把握历史主动，勇立时代潮头，构建高水平战略性中马命运共同体，为两国人民创造更多福祉，为地区繁荣稳定作出更大贡献。

　　习近平指出，马方将今年东盟的主题定为“包容性和可持续性”，体现了对时局的深刻洞察。中方支持马来西亚发挥东盟轮值主席国作用，愿同地区国家一道，尽早签署中国－东盟自由贸易区升级议定书， 以开放包容、团结合作 抵制 “ 脱钩 断链”、“小院高墙”和滥征 关税 ，以和平、合作、开放、包容的亚洲价值观回应弱肉强食的丛林法则，以亚洲的稳定性和确定性应对世界的不稳定和不确定。
　　安瓦尔热烈欢迎习近平主席到访马来西亚，表示长期以来中国真诚帮助马来西亚，安危与共、患难与共，是马来西亚值得信赖的朋友。习近平主席领导中国取得伟大发展成就，带领中国人民摆脱贫困，倡导共同繁荣、文明互鉴，是当今世界的卓越领导人。马来西亚人民敬佩中国和习近平主席。习近平主席此访取得的创纪录合作成果，对马方意义重大，马方深受鼓舞。马方坚定奉行一个中国政策，不支持任何“台独”行径。马方愿同中方深化战略沟通，巩固政治互信；扩大两国贸易，欢迎中国企业赴马投资兴业，与马方发展数字经济、绿色经济、人工智能等新兴技术领域合作，助力两国实现更大发展；增进文化、教育、旅游等人文领域交流，促进人民相知相亲；开展伊斯兰文明和儒家文明对话，促进人类文明进步。面对单边主义抬头，马方愿同中方加强合作，共同应对风险挑战。东盟不会赞同任何单方面施加关税的做法，将通过合作联合自强，保持经济增长。马方高度赞赏中国在国际地区问题上发挥的积极作用。马来西亚作为东盟轮值主席国和东盟－中国关系协调国，将推动加强东盟－中国合作，促进地区和平稳定繁荣。

Wisconsin squeaks past Minnesota for the top spot in voter turnout,"Wisconsin squeaks past Minnesota for the top spot in voter turnout
“In a heartbreakingly close contest, Minnesota lost the title of number one in voter turnout to Wisconsin for the 2024 election,” said Secretary of State Steve Simon
ST. PAUL — In the race between Gophers and Badgers for voter turnout, the Badgers won.
Voters in Wisconsin narrowly outperformed Minnesota voters in the 2024 election. The University of Florida’s Election Lab
reported
that 76.35% of the voting-eligible population cast ballots in Minnesota. In Wisconsin, 76.64% of the voting-eligible population cast ballots.

Secretary of State Steve Simon regularly touts Minnesota’s long-running first-place voter turnout position. And he said while turnout was strong in the 2024 general election, it came up just a little bit short.
“In a heartbreakingly close contest, Minnesota lost the title of number one in voter turnout to Wisconsin for the 2024 election,” he said in a statement. “We congratulate our neighbors to the east on this victory and we’ll continue our work to earn the top spot back in 2026.”
Wisconsin was one of a handful of battleground states in last year’s presidential election. Campaigns spent tens of millions of dollars in Wisconsin, and voters sent a mixed message back by reelecting Republican President Donald Trump and Democratic U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin.
Minnesota stayed in the Democratic column. Former Vice President Kamala Harris won the presidential vote in Minnesota with Gov. Tim Walz on the ticket. DFL Sen. Amy Klobuchar easily defeated her Republican opponent.

United Kingdom Supreme Court Delivers Common Sense Ruling On Transgender Debate * 100PercentFedUp.com * by,"The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom delivered a common sense ruling on the transgender debate, unanimously stating that a woman is someone born biologically female.
As a physician, I deal in biology—not ideology.
The UK Supreme Court just ruled what every doctor knows: a woman is defined by biology.
You can’t change your biological sex. Gender isn’t something you self-define.
This isn’t bigotry. It’s reality.

[April 16, 2025] Fox News reports:
Trans women can be excluded from some single-sex spaces and groups under the U.K. Equality Act, the five judges of the top court ruled. These spaces and groups include changing rooms, homeless shelters, swimming areas and medical or counseling services provided only to women.
The ruling means that even a transgender person with a certificate that recognizes them as female should not be considered a woman for equality purposes.
But Justice Patrick Hodge said its ruling “does not remove protection from trans people,” who are “protected from discrimination on the ground of gender reassignment.”
“Interpreting ‘sex’ as certificated sex would cut across the definitions of ‘man’ and ‘woman’ … and, thus, the protected characteristic of sex in an incoherent way,” Hodge said. “It would create heterogeneous groupings.”
Women’s rights groups celebrated the ruling outside the court.

Per
BBC:
The court sided with campaign group For Women Scotland, which brought a case against the Scottish government arguing that sex-based protections should only apply to people that are born female.
Judge Lord Hodge said the ruling should not be seen as a triumph of one side over the other, and stressed that the law still gives protection against discrimination to transgender people.
The Scottish government argued in court that transgender people with a gender recognition certificate (GRC) are entitled to the same sex-based protections as biological women.
The Supreme Court was asked to decide on the proper interpretation of the 2010 Equality Act, which applies across Britain.
Lord Hodge said the central question was how the words “woman” and “sex” are defined in the legislation.
He told the court: “The unanimous decision of this court is that the terms woman and sex in the Equality Act 2010 refer to a biological woman and biological sex.
“But we counsel against reading this judgement as a triumph of one or more groups in our society at the expense of another, it is not.”
He added that the legislation gives transgender people “protection, not only against discrimination through the protected characteristic of gender reassignment, but also against direct discrimination, indirect discrimination and harassment in substance in their acquired gender”.",2025-04-17T01:29:00.000+03:00,https://100percentfedup.com/243014-2,@100percFEDUP,positive
特區局長：必須保持警醒 守牢國安底線 團結一致 為香港市民打造安全和發展的樂土,"【大公報訊】記者龔學鳴報道：中央港澳工作辦公室主任、國務院港澳事務辦公室主任夏寶龍15日發表題為《以高水平安全護航高質量發展 不斷譜寫「一國兩制」實踐新篇章》的主旨講話。多名特區政府主要官員表示，夏主任的講話一針見血、意義重大。國家安全是社會繁榮穩定的重要基石，在未來的工作中，應繼續以「總體國家安全觀」為指導，在行政長官帶領下全面貫徹落實「一國兩制」方針，守牢國家安全底線，為香港高質量發展保駕護航，努力拚經濟、謀發展，打造一個以港為家、倚港興業的安全樂土。
政制及內地事務局局長曾國衞表示，面對現時美國種種無所不用其極的瘋狂遏制打壓，我們須認清楚他們的倒行逆施本質和醜惡嘴臉，不要心存幻想和僥倖，更不要有媚美、恐美、崇美、幻美的糊塗想法，而國家的立場更是十分明確堅定，就是以戰止戰、以武止戈，只有用鬥爭才能贏得和平、贏得尊重。在此大是大非之前，我們更須團結一致、堅定地與國家站在一起，堅定地站在歷史正確的一邊，這才是中國人應有的風骨和節氣。
穩健金融體系 國家安全護城河
財經事務及庫務局局長許正宇指出，每位香港居民都是國家安全的受益者和守護者。而香港穩健的金融體系就是維護國家安全的一道護城河。他表示將帶領業界和社會各方，繼續全力配合相關法律的有效實施，確保香港金融體系的安全與穩定，維護好安全和發展大局，同時助力人民幣國際化，從而在國際貨幣體系扮演更重要角色，讓我們應對全球形勢新格局時更有底氣，爭當錚錚愛國者。
保安局局長鄧炳強表示，正如夏主任所說，當前香港看似平靜，實則暗流湧動，依然面臨四大國安風險，包括：外部勢力抹黑；潛逃海外的反中亂港壞分子，繼續在美西方國家從事危害國家安全的勾當；本土恐怖主義；以及「軟對抗」。廣大市民必須慎思明辨，警惕防範，絕不能掉以輕心。作為保安局局長以及維護國家安全委員會成員，必定會帶領轄下紀律部隊，加強對國家安全形勢的分析研判，增強鬥爭精神和鬥爭本領，形成協同高效的維護國家安全工作格局，以高水平安全護航香港的高質量發展。
環境及生態局局長謝展寰表示，國家安全是社會繁榮穩定的重要基石，維護國家安全，全面落實「愛國者治港」，構建和諧美好生活，需要大家共同努力，亦需要從小培養家國情懷。生態安全也是國家安全重要的一部分。空氣、水源、土壤一旦受污染，除了直接影響健康外，甚至會影響糧食供應。保護好環境、保護好生態，既對人民健康重要，也對國家安全重要。
商務及經濟發展局局長丘應樺表示，展望未來，正如夏主任所指出的那樣，無論國際風雲如何變幻，有祖國作堅強後盾，港人努力打拚，有高水準安全的護航，香港由治及興必將乘風破浪。深信縱使面對地緣政治越演越烈，單邊保護主義帶來的經濟安全風險，我們只要繼續堅定不移發揮「一國兩制」的制度優勢，致力深化國際交往合作，不斷擴展經貿網絡，帶領商界勇於變革創新，拓展新市場，尋找新機遇，力求促進經貿發展，定能為國家經濟實力和國家安全貢獻力量。
防範脫鈎斷鏈 守護市民健康
醫務衞生局局長盧寵茂表示，夏寶龍主任回顧歷史和現實，提醒香港必須保持警醒，要以實際行動共同維護國家安全。「生物安全」關乎人民生命健康、國家長治久安、中華民族永續發展，也關乎發展新質生產力。醫衞局必須持續強化醫療系統，應對傳染病和慢性疾病的挑戰，同時亦會提升生物安全風險治理，防範脫鈎斷鏈之後，國際溝通合作受阻，美國一旦以拯救生命的藥物器械作為醜陋的鬥爭手段，危及國家安全、社會穩定和市民健康。
發展局局長甯漢豪表示，對夏主任的講話有深切體會，的確，「沒有安全哪來的香港由亂到治？沒有安全哪來的香港由治及興？沒有安全哪來的香港美好明天？」歷史和現實告訴我們，國家安全是安邦定國之基石，亦是「一國兩制」行穩致遠的根本保障。沒有安全和穩定，一切都無從談起。國安才能港安、家安，國家安全得到全面保障，我們才可以無後顧之憂全力拚經濟、謀發展、搞建設。
房屋局局長何永賢強調，我們要時刻警惕別有用心的人以各種方式將好事變壞事，把排解民生憂難，帶來社會希望的好政策，以軟對抗手段為居民製造擔憂、恐懼與不安。房屋局在推展各項政策時會保持警惕，努力解說，以凝聚建設社會的最大共識，以專業誠懇的態度，吸納社會的好建議，平衡實際情況及社會需求，為市民安居創造最大空間。
公務員事務局局長楊何蓓茵指出，在過去培訓工作的基礎上，局方會多管齊下，持續加強培訓的質和量，除了全面認識憲法、基本法、總體國家安全觀、國家體制和重要政策，以及《公務員守則》載列的12項基本信念和操守準則，亦會進一步把國安教育和愛國教育結合，安排不同形式的考察和參訪活動，以切合各級公務員的培訓需要。
教育局局長蔡若蓮表示，為了防範校園中的「軟對抗」，我們不僅從「強心」出發，加強價值觀教育，培養學生的愛國情懷；還致力提升教師的專業認知和敏感度，建立「強師」隊伍。通過加強學校監察管理，合力築起國安保護網。同時，與社會各界攜手同心，強化跨界別合作，裝備年輕一代成為愛國愛港的接班人，維護國家安全，確保「一國兩制」行穩致遠。
同抗「軟對抗」 化解風險隱患
創新科技及工業局局長孫東指出，香港作為世界上最自由開放的經濟體之一，並實施「零關稅」政策，面對全球貿易、供應鏈被擾亂秩序，國家安全比任何時候更顯重要。我們要堅持以新安全格局保障新發展格局，主動作為為一眾企業家、創業者、科學家打造一個以港為家、倚港興業的安全樂土，讓他們可以安心發揮推動經濟發展主力軍作用，繼續看好香港、支持香港、投資香港。
民政及青年事務局局長麥美娟表示，在新形勢下，民青局必與社會各界攜手化解風險隱患，在全社會形成共抗「軟對抗」的健康局面。正如夏主任所言，每位香港居民都是國家安全的受益者和守護者，沒有「局外人」。每個人、每個社團、每個企業、每個組織，都要正視香港發展和安全面臨的問題，提高警惕、團結一致，保衛香港、保衛國家。
勞工及福利局局長孫玉菡指出，勞工界和社福界一定繼續積極履行維護國家安全的義務。當局去年已完成《社工註冊條例》的修訂，現時正推進修訂《職工會條例》，以加強維護國家安全和完善系統上的管理，確保社工界別和職工會不會被別有用心的人乘虛而入，危害國家安全。
運輸及物流局局長陳美寶指出，局方上下會繼續在行政長官帶領下，堅定維護國家重點領域安全；並以擔當帶領角色，為備受美國加徵關稅無理影響的物流行業，提供更多具體導向，協助業界配合市場轉型，包括開拓新興市場，例如中南美、大洋洲、東盟等；加強與粵港澳大灣區港口協作，共同開拓新貨源，開闢跨省物流通道；豁免部分貨物的出入口許可證要求以吸引更多中轉貨物，擴展海轉空、陸轉空等多式聯運模式；善用香港國際化優勢，深化與國際港口和船舶合作，擔當好「超級聯繫人」角色；擴大航運及航空網絡，為香港物流業尋找新增長點。
文化體育及旅遊局局長羅淑佩表示，國家安全涵蓋二十個領域，對香港的長遠發展至關重要。其中，文化安全是國家安全不可或缺的一部分，作為民族精神支柱，起着維繫着國家穩定與社會凝聚力的作用。今年是抗戰勝利80周年，當局將舉辦一系列專題展覽及公眾教育活動，讓市民深入了解中華文化的核心內涵，增強文化自信和愛國情懐，傳承中華優秀傳統文化，強化全民維護國家安全的責任感。",2025-04-17T00:05:18.738+03:00,https://epaper.tkww.hk/a/202504/17/AP6800116ae4b0fbda9a1e8d75.html,大文電子報用戶,positive

LA County Board OKs $47.9B budget for upcoming fiscal year,"The Board of Supervisors voted 5-0 Tuesday to tentatively approve a $47.9 billion recommended by the Los Angeles County CEO that includes 3% budget cuts for some departments to “offset extraordinary budget pressures,” officials said.
CEO Fesia Davenport’s recommended budget is $1.3 billion less than the current spending plan and includes over $1 billion in costs related to the deadly January wildfires that devastated communities in Pacific Palisades, Malibu, Altadena, Pasadena and Sierra Madre.
According to a county statement, the budget also reflects “rapidly mounting financial challenges,” such as the possible loss of hundreds of millions of federal dollars and the tentative $4 billion settlement of nearly 7,000 claims of sexual abuse against county employees, mainly at probation camps and juvenile halls. Those claims were brought under Assembly Bill 218, known as the California Child Victims Act.
Another budget pressure is slower property tax revenue growth that’s partially because of a 41% decline in home sales since 2021 amid higher interest rates.
The pressures have prompted county departments to make 3% cuts in their budgets, targeting a total of $88.9 million while eliminating 310 job vacancies and more than $50 million in cost savings from cutting supplies, postponing equipment purchases and limiting the scope of some programs.
“Our revenue outlook is challenging, to put it mildly,” Davenport told the board during her presentation Tuesday. “The amount of new ongoing funding in this budget is at a five-year low.”
The transition from the Biden to Trump administrations will result in at least 13% of the county’s budget sourced from federal funding could be at risk, Davenport said. State budgets including California’s also risk losing federal funds, potentially impacting county finances and its ability to provide public services.
Davenport noted the recent federal proposal to rescind $45 million from the county Public Health Department.
“While a $47.9 billion budget may sound like a lot, it’s important to remember that Los Angeles County has a long list of responsibilities — especially when it comes to protecting and preserving the safety net services upon which our most vulnerable residents rely,” Board Chair and 5th District Supervisor Kathryn Barger said in a statement.
“This year’s budget recommendation reflects the reality of the moment,” Barger said. “We’re facing historic financial challenges, many of which are still developing. The destruction caused by the January wildfires, including the Eaton and Palisades fires, demands more than just short-term responses — it requires long-term investments to support impacted residents on the road to full recovery.”
Barger also highlighted county spending to address homelessness and provide mental health services, as well as a bigger payroll for additional sheriff’s deputies.
“The budget’s $102 million in one-time funding to expand interim and permanent supportive housing, along with 149 new Department of Mental Health positions, will strengthen our crisis response system and improve access to essential services for children, adolescents, and others in need,” she said.
I’m also glad to support continued investment in recruiting and retaining Sheriff’s deputies. It’s a vital step toward bolstering our public safety workforce and engaging qualified applicants right away so we can adequately hire to keep our communities safe.”
Supervisor Hilda Solis also commented on the budget challenges and provided spending highlights.
“The County has faced challenging economic times in the past, but not quite at this magnitude and not simultaneously,” she said. “It is in these trying times that it is critical that we continue to prioritize the well-being of our most vulnerable residents.
“Despite a constrained budget, we must continue to invest in programs that provide essential support, such as job opportunities for youth, legal representation for immigrants, and critical resources for those transitioning out of foster care. … I will continue to advocate for sustainable funding for these programs to ensure they can support our communities in the long term.”
Solis also noted proposed federal budget cuts that would reduce funding for Medicaid, CalFresh and other social-safety-net programs to the tune of $880 billion from Medicaid and $200 billion from CalFresh. The programs provide health care and food assistance.
The District 1 supervisor pointed to these outlays for key programs:
$12.3 million for Youth at Work, which provides paid jobs for 10,000 foster youth, justice-involved youth, parenting teens and youth experiencing homelessness; $5.5 million for the Represent LA program, which funds legal representation for immigrants; $3 million for Self-Help Legal Access Centers, which helps people who don’t have legal representation navigate the court system; $3.4 million for the program known as Guaranteed Basic Income Expansion for Transitional Age Youth. The program offers monthly stipends and support services to help young people from the foster-care system transition into adulthood; and $125,000 for consultant services to maintain the Gender Impact Assessment initiative, which supports county departments in identifying and addressing gender disparities. As Davenport detailed the possible impacts from reductions in federal and state financial aid, supervisors were generally supportive of the spending curtailments.
“We are in uncharted territory with these simultaneous pressures on our budget,” Davenport said in a statement Monday. “Any of these alone would be daunting, but taken together these challenges — the wildfires, the AB 218 (sex abuse) settlement, the threat of deep cuts in federal funding — are cause for great concern.”
The recommended budget is the first step in the county’s budget cycle. The process continues with public hearings in May and deliberations for adoption in June, concluding in October with the supplemental budget to finalize adjustments.",2025-04-17T01:12:00.000+03:00,https://heysocal.com/2025/04/16/301724,Joe Taglieri,positive
Projeto de bairro na área do antigo Aeroporto Carlos Prates terá financiamento de R$ 7 milhões,"O Conselho do Programa de Parcerias de Investimentos (PPI), vinculado à Casa Civil da Presidência da República, aprovou, nesta quarta-feira (16), o financiamento de R$ 7 milhões para a Prefeitura de Belo Horizonte (PBH) com o objetivo de contratar estudos para a viabilidade da implantação do novo bairro na área do antigo Aeroporto Carlos Prates.
A parceria entre o Executivo municipal e federal teve início após a desativação do aeroporto, realizada pelo governo federal em 2023. Os aportes serão destinados ao desenvolvimento de quatro estudos técnicos para estruturar o bairro de forma financeiramente sustentável, ambientalmente responsável e socialmente inclusiva.
Conforme a resolução publicada no Diário Oficial da União (DOU), está prevista a contratação dos seguintes serviços:
estudo de mercado imobiliário, estudo de mobilidade e adensamento anteprojeto de implantação modelagem econômica (que dependente dos demais estudos) A parceria valida o compromisso firmado em fevereiro de 2024, quando foi assinado o Acordo de Cooperação Técnica (ACT) entre a PBH e a Secretaria de Patrimônio da União. O acordo prevê o compartilhamento de responsabilidades, incluindo a elaboração de estudos e a estruturação de um modelo de gestão para a área onde ficava localizado o Aeroporto Carlos Prates.
A proposta da PBH é que a área englobe habitação de qualidade, áreas verdes, equipamentos públicos e soluções inteligentes para mobilidade e infraestrutura. Desde a assinatura do ACT, a prefeitura da Capital já elaborou um macroplano urbanístico, iniciou a recuperação do Parque Maria do Socorro e realizou a instalação dos primeiros equipamentos de saúde e educação.
A previsão é que os estudos estejam concluídos em 2026, permitindo a abertura dos processos de licenciamento e a formalização da transferência definitiva da área ao município.

New Arizona law curbs students' cellphone use at schools - NewsBreak,"(The Center Square) - Arizona legislators are excited about a new law to address cellphone distractions among students during class time. House Bill 2484 , which Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs signed this week, was introduced by Rep. Beverly Pingerelli, R-District 21. Pingerelli called the law a necessary step to bring back discipline in classrooms and restore academic focus. “Education requires attention, and attention is exactly what today’s students are being robbed of by addictive devices and endless scrolling,” Pingerelli said in a press release . “We’ve drawn a clear line: Arizona classrooms are for learning, not TikTok.” Sen. Shawnna Bolick, R-District 20, introduced a bill similar to the one that became law. “She took some provisions from my bill. I took some provisions from hers, and hopefully in two more years when we have a Republican governor, I would like to see a stronger policy in place, but I think this is a good first step,” Bolick, expressing optimism for her party in the 2026 election, told The Center Square. The law requires a public meeting for school districts to produce a policy. Schools that already have a policy are not expected to go back and make changes. “In my opinion, having two kids who are now 20 and 23, I know each of their schools have their own policy when it came to cellphone use during class time,” said Bolick, who previously sat on different charter school boards. “My son’s school did not permit cellphones at all during the school day. My daughter could basically text me all day if I had wanted her to, which I did not do because I'm not a helicopter parent. But there are unfortunately some parents out there that want to track their kids all day long in school.” Much like a student playing games, calling or texting frequently on a phone can be a distraction for teachers who are already battling for the students’ attention in class, Bolick said. One parent recently informed Bolick that she is leaving the education profession after a male student threw his I-pad at her. “She told me that she was starting a new job outside the school system because her administrators didn't even discipline the kid for throwing his device at her,” said Bolick. She added that cellphones have become like a addictive drug. Pingerelli also has teachers in mind with this law. “Teachers shouldn’t have to compete with YouTube and Instagram to be heard,” said Pingerelli. “HB2484 refocuses kids on learning, empowering parents and backing up teachers.” Pointing to studies out of London and Pew Research, Bolick said policies to cut down on cellphone distractions will help improve test scores. As a result, Bolick recommended other states should follow Arizona in passing similar legislation. “We’re considered a highly industrialized countries, and we are falling far behind. And that's not a good thing,” said Bolick.",2025-04-17T01:00:00.000+03:00,https://www.newsbreak.com/the-center-square-509740/3965927969290-new-arizona-law-curbs-students-cellphone-use-at-schools,Chris Woodward | The Center Square contributor,positive

Cole to lead Troy University's John W. Schmidt Center for Student Success,"Cole to lead Troy University’s John W. Schmidt Center for Student Success Faculty/Staff  | April 16, 2025
Lauren Cole has been a member of the Troy University staff since 2011 and now will lead the John W. Schmidt Center for Student Success.
Lauren S. Cole has been named Executive Director of Troy University’s John W. Schmidt (JWS) Center for Student Success.
The JWS center provides programs and services that enhance Troy University students’ academic achievement, personal and social growth, campus and civic engagement, career development and persistence to graduation.
“I am excited about the future of our John W. Schmidt Center for Student Success with Lauren Cole at the helm,” said Dr. Kerry Palmer, Senior Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs. “Lauren is respected throughout our university community for her professionalism and enthusiasm. She is passionate about helping students succeed, and I believe we will see that passion expressed through the Center on a daily basis.”
Cole joined the TROY staff in 2011 as Director of Career Services. In that role, her goal each day mirrored her office’s mission: “Prepare tomorrow’s professionals for today’s global workforce.” This included assisting students and alumni with career coaching, resumes, interviewing, networking and other career-related tasks.
In addition, Cole taught career courses, conducted workshops and coordinated career fairs, developing relationships with businesses interested in hiring TROY graduates, and has served on several university-wide committees.
In addition to the responsibilities of overseeing the JWS Center, Cole also directs the Chancellor’s Fellows Leadership Development Program.
Prior to joining the TROY staff, Cole served for five years as a Trade and Marketing Specialist with the Alabama Department of Industries where she traveled around the world, marketing Alabama food and agricultural products.
She earned a Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Food Science from Auburn University, a Master of Business Administration from Auburn University in Montgomery and is currently a Doctoral Candidate in Troy University’s Global Leadership Ph.D. program.
“I am excited to step into the role of Executive Director of the John W. Schmidt Center for Student Success,” Cole said. “Having previously worked in Career Services within the Center, I’ve had the privilege of building relationships and gaining insights into the student-centered work being done here. This new position will enable me to collaborate closely with our dedicated professional staff and deeply engage with their programs, as we collectively strive to support and enhance student success at TROY.”
Cole is married to David Cole, who is President of the Ductile Iron Pipe Association (DIPRA), and they have one son, Witt, who is 12 years old, and one daughter, Chandler, who is 9. They are members of Troy First Methodist Church and are both active in their community.

Family Offices Favor Ethereum ETFs Over Bitcoin Options,"Family offices and professional investors are managing their allocations of spot Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded products (ETPs) differently, with family offices showing a notably stronger inclination towards Ethereum.
Data collected by Bitwise as of December 31, 2024, reveals that family offices and trusts have allocated 0.62% of their assets under management (AUM) to spot Ethereum ETPs, while spot Bitcoin ETPs attract merely 0.13%.
This indicates a nearly fivefold higher allocation percentage for Ethereum among this investor demographic, although this does not equate to larger absolute figures.
The discrepancy underscores the contrasting institutional dynamics within the two asset classes. Although Bitcoin continues to lead in total institutional AUM, encompassing hedge funds and investment advisors, Ethereum appears to be more appealing to smaller, often more adaptable investors like family offices.
The overall composition of the ETP market also illustrates these differences in investor types and their respective risk profiles.
Hedge funds, advisors, and brokerages Hedge funds represent the largest segment of Bitcoin ETP AUM at 36.97%, closely followed by investment advisors at 33.11%. Brokerages contribute an additional 14.91%, collectively accounting for over 85% of total allocations when factoring in smaller players like banks and pension funds.
On the contrary, Ethereum ETP ownership is more evenly spread across brokerages (25.25%), investment advisors (29.79%), and hedge funds (24.74%), along with a significantly larger “Other” category making up 16.96% of Ethereum ETP AUM.
Banks and pension funds have made modest allocations to both Bitcoin and Ethereum products. Bitcoin ETPs capture 1.27% and 1.02% of their AUM from banks and pension funds respectively, while Ethereum ETPs receive 0.62% and 0.90%.
Private equity firms mirror this limited engagement, allocating 2.90% to Bitcoin and just 1.11% to Ethereum.
Even with the relative preference for Ethereum among family offices, their total investments represent a minor fraction of the overall institutional activity. Venture capital and insurance firms show negligible exposure to either ETP category.
Institutional holders vary across assets The leading holders of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETPs also vary significantly. Millennium Management tops the list with $4.42 billion in Bitcoin ETP holdings, followed by Brevan Howard, Jane Street, and Goldman Sachs.
In the Ethereum sector, Goldman Sachs is the leader with $477 million, trailed by Jane Street at $450 million and Millennium Management at $182 million.
Several institutions, including Jane Street, D.E. Shaw, and Brevan Howard, appear on both lists, signaling broad engagement with crypto ETPs.
However, other firms, such as Elequin, HBK Investments, SG Americas Securities, and Almitas Capital, are found exclusively among the top Ethereum ETP holders. Conversely, Capula Management and Horizon Kinetics maintain substantial positions in Bitcoin ETPs but are not represented among Ethereum’s prominent institutional stakeholders.
This separation indicates that while major asset managers and market makers are active in both markets, Ethereum draws a more unique set of secondary institutions.
The analysis confirms Bitcoin’s ongoing dominance in total value while also uncovering a broader and more diverse investor base within the Ethereum ETP market.

ANCA Rising Leaders Advance Armenian Advocacy in Washington,"2025 Session #2 Spotlights Career Development and Capitol Hill Action on Armenian Hostages, Artsakh Return, and Azerbaijan Sanctions
WASHINGTON—The Armenian National Committee of America concluded its 2025 Rising Leaders initiative with a powerful second session, from March 22 to 25, bringing together fourteen dynamic student leaders from across the U.S., Canada, and Armenia for four days of professional development and grassroots advocacy in the heart of the nation’s capital.
“This session of Rising Leaders reminds us once again of the vast potential our nation has and the powerful return on our investments in youth,” stated ANCA Programs Coordinator Nareg Mesrobian. “It was truly inspiring to see our ANCA platforms empowering passionate and principled youth around our shared national aims and aspirations. The trust we have placed in our youth over the course of more than a century – as torchbearers for our Cause – is a key to the remarkable strength and endurance of our community as a global pillar of the Armenian nation,” concluded Mesrobian.
The program, hosted in partnership with the Armenian Youth Federation Eastern and Western U.S., was made possible through the generous support of longtime ANCA supporter Dean Shahinian, Esq., and the family and friends of the late Lucine Zadoian Kouchakdjian, a lifelong community activist and ANCA leader.
Rising Leaders began their experience with an evening tour of Washington, D.C. and orientation sessions at the ANCA Aramian House. Sunday’s programming included a keynote on grassroots power by ANCA National Grassroots Director Gev Iskajyan, followed by a media and public policy career panel featuring POLITICO Senior Politics Editor Charlie Mahtesian and Armenian Legal Center founding Executive Director Kate Nahapetian.
Workshops and resume reviews were led by Hovig Apo Saghdejian Capital Gateway Program Advisory Committee members and mentors including Haig Hovsepian, Arsen Markarov, and Areni Margossian, with a second career panel highlighting Armenian American professionals in federal intelligence, foreign policy, and consulting, featuring Sipan Ohannesian, Nanar Ohannesian, and Margossian.
Monday’s sessions focused on in-depth policy briefings led by ANCA Executive Director Aram Hamparian and former Artsakh Ambassador to the U.S. Robert Avetisyan. Participants engaged in advocacy training simulations and strategic planning with ANCA Government Affairs Director Tereza Yerimyan and ANCA Policy Director Alex Galitsky. The day concluded with a dinner and discussion with Dr. Robert Krikorian focusing on Armenian American voices in the U.S. State Department.
The highlight of the program came on Tuesday, March 25, during the Lucine Zadoian Kouchakdjian Capitol Hill Day. Rising Leaders met with over 400 Congressional offices, urging lawmakers to demand the immediate release of Armenian POWs, support the protected return of Artsakh’s Armenian population, provide robust security aid to Armenia, and hold Azerbaijan accountable through targeted sanctions.
Participants also engaged with members of the Congressional Armenian Staff Association during a special “Lunch and Learn” session focused on public service career paths and legislative advocacy. Rising Leaders asked questions about how Armenian Americans can pursue meaningful careers on Capitol Hill and received guidance on internships, staff roles, and how their unique backgrounds can shape U.S. policy. The panel provided both inspiration and tangible next steps for students considering careers in government service.
ANCA Western Region’s Alex Manoukian and Hovig Apo Saghdejian Capital Gateway Program alumnus Richard Minasian joined ANCA D.C. team leads in offering guidance to the student advocates on Capitol Hill and throughout the program.
The 2025 Rising Leaders – Session 2 Participants include:
Perla Dertawitian, a second-year political science major at Queen’s University (Canada) with a minor in global development and a certificate in French, serves as the political chair of the AYF Aram Manoukian Chapter and the incoming president of the Armenian Student Association at Queen’s. “My Armenian heritage and the challenges facing Armenia and Artsakh have sparked my passion for diplomacy and political activism,” she shared.
Sofia Gevorgian, a third-year student at UCLA, is double majoring in political science and Middle Eastern studies. She leads the Armenian Pre-Law Students Association, interns at the Center for Truth and Justice, and serves as All-ASA Director of Advocacy. “I’m here at the ANCA Rising Leaders Program to better familiarize myself with lobbying and advocacy, and I’m especially excited to speak with staffers tomorrow at the US Capitol,” said Gevorgian.
Gevorg Ghazaryan, originally from Artashat, Armenia, is a sophomore at the University of Pennsylvania, majoring in philosophy, politics, and economics with a concentration in public policy and governance. He is co-founder of Maqoor, one of Armenia’s largest youth-led environmental organizations, and has represented Armenia at the UN and European Parliament. “ANCA Rising Leaders was my first real experience with advocacy, and it opened my eyes to the power of our collective voice. From speaking with members of Congress to discovering a strong, passionate Armenian community I didn’t know I was part of, I left feeling empowered and connected,” explained Ghazaryan.
Yeva Grigoryan, a senior at Oakton High School in Virginia, is co-chair of the Washington, D.C. ACYOA Chapter and vice president of the Armenian Behavioral Science Student Association. “I am thrilled to return to our nation’s capital with the ANCA Rising Leaders program not only to build strong relationships with Armenian youth from across North America but also to continue advocating for justice for Hai Tahd on Capitol Hill,” said Grigoryan.
Anahit Hakobyan, a fourth-year political science student at the University of Toronto focusing on comparative politics and Canadian studies, is co-president of the university Armenian Students Association. “The ANCA Rising Leaders Program is truly a transformative experience. It empowers youth to fight for Hai Tahd and emphasizes the agency and power in each and every Armenian, no matter where they will be, and what sphere they will enter.”
Shushanik Hayriyan, a junior political science major at the College of Idaho, is from Artsakh and serves as co-president of the Armenian Student Organization and president of the Idaho Chapter of the Society for Orphaned Armenian Relief. “I am thrilled to be in Washington, D.C., to make connections with fellow Armenian professionals in different fields and to strengthen my advocacy skills.”
Aram Kedeshian, a senior at Flintridge Preparatory School in California and an Eagle Scout with AGBU Troop 86, has a strong interest in both history and finance. “I am very excited to participate in the ANCA Rising Leaders Program because it is an excellent opportunity to expand my professional network, improve my advocacy skills, and promote the Armenian Cause,” Aram explained.
Arek Kedeshian, also a senior at Flintridge Preparatory School, is focused on foreign policy, finance, and politics, and is eager to strengthen his advocacy skills on behalf of Armenia and Artsakh. “Participating in the ANCA Rising Leaders Program was truly an incredible experience. Visiting Capitol Hill, I was able to engage directly with congressional staff and bring attention to the pressing challenges facing our global Armenian community,” Arek remarked.
Tamara Nahapetyan, a senior at Innovation Academy and dual-enrolled at Kennesaw State University, is majoring in political science with plans to pursue a career in international law. She has been actively involved in Model UN, HOSA, Doctors Without Borders, and Active Minds. In 2023, she interned at Georgetown University, where she co-led a public health campaign addressing typhoid fever in Nigeria “The Rising Leaders Program was a life-changing experience that taught me how to be a strong leader for my Armenian-American community and cemented my dedication to strengthening the Armenian Cause.”
Isabel Ohanissian, a freshman industrial engineering student at Penn State University, is involved in the Institute of Industrial and Systems Engineers and serves as an envoy for SCOPE, a Women in Engineering Program initiative. “This program made me more confident in speaking about Armenian causes with non-Armenians in Capitol Hill. By having to persuade non-Armenians about the importance of Armenian causes, I was able to deepen my own understanding of Armenia’s standing today and its challenges,” noted Ohanissian.
Ellena Shahbandarian, a second-year student at UC San Diego, is double majoring in psychology and political science. She is active in HRI, a campus organization supporting Armenian villages, and volunteers at Christian Outreach for Armenians. “This is my first time in Washington, D.C., and I have deeply enjoyed my time here – connecting with Armenians across North America and learning how to support the Armenian Cause,” stated Shahbandarian.
Charles Simonian, a junior at Flintridge Preparatory School in La Canada, CA, is committed to Armenian identity and civic leadership. He joined Rising Leaders to deepen his understanding of diaspora advocacy and policymaking. “I’m excited to continue learning and growing in this field and look forward to continuing my advocacy and community service when I return home.”
Margarita Simonyan, a first-year student at Stanford University, is majoring in international relations with a focus on security, peacebuilding, and transitional justice. She is the founder of Armenian Youth Education Aid and serves as Advocacy Chair of Stanford’s Armenian Student Association. “I’m here in the nation’s capital not just to witness Armenian advocacy but to be a force within it, to learn, to contribute, and to make sure our presence isn’t just acknowledged but impossible to ignore.”
Paul Tatarian, a senior at Northwest High School in Maryland, plans to study finance at Montgomery College. A six-year member of the AYF D.C. Ani Chapter, he has been dedicated to service in the Armenian Church and community. “I am eager to be in Washington, D.C., to learn how to advocate more effectively for the Armenian Cause.”
The ANCA Rising Leaders Program reflects the longstanding partnership between the ANCA and the Armenian Youth Federation, with AYF chapters preparing youth across the country for a life of civic responsibility and activism. AYF members serve as both participants and mentors, offering peer leadership and national coordination that strengthen the movement at every level.
AYF Western U.S. Chair Hakop Hajibekyan, a 2019 Rising Leaders alumnus, remarked, “The Rising Leaders Program connects our community’s passion with action. Watching these students grow into confident advocates is a privilege and a promise for our future.”
AYF Eastern U.S. Chair Isabel Hagobian added, “What makes this program powerful is its authenticity—young Armenians speaking from the heart and learning how to transform that energy into meaningful change.”
This year’s cohort included AYF members from local chapters across North America, each bringing years of grassroots service and community leadership to their Capitol Hill advocacy. The Rising Leaders initiative continues to serve as a national extension of the AYF’s mission to cultivate engaged, educated, and empowered Armenian youth.
The ANCA Rising Leaders Program is made possible by the generosity of Dean Shahinian, Esq., who served in senior roles in the U.S. Senate for over 30 years, and the family and friends of Lucine Zadoian Kouchakdjian, whose lifetime of service to Armenian advocacy continues to inspire future generations.
Shahinian, who played a key role in major national legislation, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and Dodd-Frank reforms, has long championed civic education and professional development for Armenian youth. His support helps ensure that Rising Leaders gain the civic engagement tools, long-term mentorship, and confidence to pursue careers in public service.
Lucine Kouchakdjian’s legacy is felt in every meeting and every moment of Rising Leaders. A pillar of the Washington Armenian community for decades, she dedicated her life to building civic awareness and political strength in the Armenian American diaspora. Her namesake Capitol Hill Day is a living tribute to that vision.

O ministro de Minas e Energia, Alexandre Silveira, disse nesta quarta-feira (16/4) ter “extrema convicção” de que haverá “boas notícias” na questão dos preços dos combustíveis no país.
“Todos sabem que o meu maior foco é sempre apontar para o caminho do menor preço na bomba para o consumidor brasileiro. Eu tenho extrema convicção de que nós teremos boas notícias na questão dos combustíveis nos próximos dias, por questões objetivas: queda do [barril do petróleo] Brent, estabilidade do dólar. Então, nós temos um ambiente muito favorável à redução do preço”, disse ele a jornalistas.
Ele disse que sua defesa é a mesma da política liderada pelo presidente Lula no setor energético.
Na semana passada, os preços internacionais do petróleo caíram para os menores valores registrados nos últimos 4 anos, em meio à escalada da guerra comercial entre Estados Unidos e China.

Insights
Great Southern Bancorp's Q1 earnings showed impressive 30% YoY EPS growth with improved margins, credit quality, and capital position, signaling strong fundamental performance.
Great Southern Bancorp delivered an impressive first quarter with diluted EPS of $1.47, representing a substantial 30.1% increase from $1.13 in Q1 2024. This significant earnings improvement was driven by multiple fundamental strengths in the bank's operations.
The core banking economics show notable improvement across key metrics. Net interest income increased by $4.5 million or 10.1% year-over-year, reaching $49.3 million, while net interest margin expanded to 3.57% from 3.32% in the prior-year period. This margin expansion is particularly impressive given the challenging rate environment many regional banks are navigating.
Credit quality remains exceptional, with non-performing assets at just 0.16% of total assets ($9.5 million), essentially unchanged from year-end. The bank's disciplined underwriting approach is evident in its ability to record a negative provision for credit losses of $348,000 this quarter, compared to a $630,000 expense in Q1 2024—effectively a $978,000 positive swing to the bottom line.
The bank's profitability metrics show substantial improvement, with return on average equity reaching 11.30% (up from 9.36%) and return on average assets at 1.15% (up from 0.93%). These returns place Great Southern among the better-performing regional banks in the current environment.
Capital levels remain robust with a Tier 1 Leverage Ratio of 11.3% and tangible common equity ratio of 10.1%, providing significant flexibility for capital deployment. The newly authorized stock repurchase program of up to one million shares (approximately 8.7% of outstanding shares based on current market cap and share price) demonstrates management's confidence in the bank's financial position and commitment to returning capital to shareholders.
Looking ahead, investors should note that the bank will lose approximately $2 million per quarter in interest income from a terminated swap after Q3 2025, which could create a modest headwind. However, this appears manageable given the bank's overall earnings trajectory and strong balance sheet position.

Net interest income for the first quarter of 2025 increased
The average rates paid on deposits and borrowings decreased compared to the prior-year first quarter as market interest rates, primarily the federal funds rate and SOFR rates, declined in the fourth quarter of 2024. Yields on the Company’s portfolio of investment securities increased compared to the prior-year first quarter due to higher-yielding securities purchased in the second quarter of 2024. While market interest rates decreased compared to the first quarter of 2024, the average yield on loans increased slightly as cash flows from lower-rate fixed rate loans were redeployed into loans with comparably higher rates of interest.
To mitigate exposure to the risk of fluctuations in future cash flows resulting from changes in interest rates (primarily related to falling interest rates), the Company has, from time to time, strategically utilized derivative financial instruments, primarily interest rate swaps, as part of its interest rate risk management strategy.
The following table presents the effect of cash flow hedge accounting included in interest income in the consolidated statements of income:

LIQUIDITY AND DEPOSITS
Liquidity is a measure of the Company’s ability to generate sufficient cash to meet present and future financial obligations in a timely manner. The Company’s primary sources of funds are customer deposits, FHLBank advances, other borrowings, loan repayments, unpledged securities, proceeds from sales of loans and available-for-sale securities and funds provided from operations. The Company utilizes some or all of these sources of funds depending on the comparative costs and availability at the time.

Management believes that the Company maintains overall liquidity sufficient to satisfy its depositors’ requirements and meet its borrowers’ credit needs.

BUSINESS INITIATIVES
During the quarter ended March 31, 2025, no material changes occurred regarding the status of the litigation and the agreement in principle between Great Southern and its third-party vendor involving a previously proposed new core banking platform. No assurance can be given as to when or whether final agreements will be executed and a full settlement of the matter will be achieved.
Technology updates and advancements continue with the Company’s current core provider. Projects involving a full array of products and services are moving forward, with completions expected beginning in the third quarter of 2025 and continuing into 2026.
During the quarter ended March 31, 2025, the Company installed 10 ITM units in the St. Louis, Mo. market, replacing existing end-of-life ATM units.

In March 2025, the Company began construction of a new banking center at 723 N. Benton in Springfield, Mo., to replace the existing facility at that location. The new construction, designed as a next-generation banking center, will allow for flexibility in testing new designs, processes, technology and tools balanced with customer convenience. Construction is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2025. During construction, customers are being served by a temporary facility on the property.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
This document contains certain financial information determined by methods other than in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). This non-GAAP financial information includes the tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio.
In calculating the ratio of tangible common equity to tangible assets, we subtract period-end intangible assets from common equity and from total assets. Management believes that the presentation of this measure excluding the impact of intangible assets provides useful supplemental information that is helpful in understanding our financial condition and results of operations, as it provides a method to assess management’s success in utilizing our tangible capital as well as our capital strength. Management also believes that providing a measure that excludes balances of intangible assets, which are subjective components of valuation, facilitates the comparison of our performance with the performance of our peers. In addition, management believes that this is a standard financial measure used in the banking industry to evaluate performance.
This non-GAAP financial measurement is supplemental and is not a substitute for any analysis based on GAAP financial measures. Because not all companies use the same calculation of non-GAAP measures, this presentation may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures as calculated by other companies.

12年来，中马共建“一带一路”合作取得丰硕成果，基础设施建设不断升级、贸易规模持续扩大、新兴领域合作方兴未艾，成为区域经济一体化和中国—东盟共建“一带一路”的典范。展望未来，中国将与马来西亚一道，将高质量共建“一带一路”推向新高度，为全球南方国家团结合作、共同发展注入正能量。
马来西亚是古代海上丝绸之路沿线重要国家，也是最早响应共建“一带一路”倡议的国家之一，更是共建“一带一路”早期收获最丰硕的国家之一。2013年以来，共建“一带一路”倡议同马来西亚“昌明经济”框架等深度对接，中马合作取得丰硕成果，成为区域经济一体化和中国—东盟共建“一带一路”的典范。
务实合作持续提质升级
当前经济全球化遭遇空前“回头浪”，极限施压和关税讹诈严重扰乱全球贸易秩序，让全球产业链供应链面临断供断链风险，中马共建“一带一路”在逆境中展现出强大活力，为变乱交织的世界注入稳定剂，推动打造更紧密的中国—东盟命运共同体。
基础设施建设不断升级。比如，由中交马东铁项目公司承建的马来西亚东海岸铁路作为中马高质量共建“一带一路”旗舰项目，全长约665公里，计划2027年底竣工，将打通关丹港和巴生港，构建起连接马来西亚东西海岸的重要“陆上桥梁”，填补马来半岛东西岸没有铁路贯通的空白，提升货物运输效率。今年1月，马东铁项目正线A、B段轨道铺通，标志着项目取得重要阶段性进展。
贸易规模持续扩大。中国已连续16年成为马来西亚最大贸易伙伴，而马来西亚则是中国在东盟成员国中的第二大贸易伙伴和最大进口来源国。2024年，中马双边贸易额达到2120亿美元，比两国建交时增长近千倍。中马贸易结构互补性强，中国自马进口计算机零部件、棕榈油和塑料制品等，对马出口服装和纺织品等。
“两国双园”合作不断深入。马中关丹产业园和中马钦州产业园区树立了“两国双园”模式下双边经济合作的创新典范。马中关丹产业园依托两国自然禀赋、产业优势和市场资源，园区产业体系加速构筑，已成为马来西亚东海岸经济特区最成功的工业园区之一。随着扩建工程全面完成，关丹港吞吐量预计将翻番，从2600万吨增至5200万吨，马中关丹产业园升级扩园与新项目建设将进一步促进共建“一带一路”沿线货物流动和贸易发展。
新兴领域合作方兴未艾
随着全球供应链加速重构，中马积极探索共建“一带一路”更深层次的产业链合作。在电子产品和机械制造领域，中马企业形成了产业链“垂直分工”的模式。这种合作模式不仅提高了两国产业链的效率，还带动了相关技术的进步。更重要的是，它增强了中马两国在全球供应链中的竞争力。随着两国产业园区的进一步发展，这种跨境供应链合作将持续拓展到新能源和人工智能等更多领域。
此外，随着中马“绿色丝绸之路”合作不断深入，合作领域也不断拓宽。中国企业在沙巴州建设的地面光伏项目已经上网发电，在吉打州南部的瓜拉基蒂光伏电站商业运行顺利。在制造业领域，中资企业也成为马来西亚光伏行业发展的重要推动力量，有力促进了当地光伏全产业链发展。在新能源汽车领域，马来西亚宝腾汽车与中国吉利控股集团的合资合作，提升了宝腾的生产效率并恢复了其在马来西亚的销售，吉利计划投资100亿美元建设汽车枢纽，预计将吸引更多高质量的电动汽车及零部件投资，提升马来西亚在全球汽车和相关技术领域的地位。
围绕“数字丝绸之路”，中马在人工智能、丝路电商、智慧物流等领域合作取得了长足进步，助力马来西亚建设成为区域数字经济领导者。目前，在中国企业的支持下，马来西亚“数智港口”“绿色智慧电厂”“数智供应链”等项目正在不断落实。
构建更紧密的命运共同体
中马共建“一带一路”走过12年光辉历程，如今又一次站在了新征程起点上。2025年，马来西亚正式成为金砖伙伴国，同时担任东盟轮值主席国和中国—东盟关系协调国。中国将与马来西亚一道，将高质量共建“一带一路”推向新高度，推动构建更为紧密的中国—东盟命运共同体。
加快中国—东盟自贸区3.0版落地。2024年，中国与东盟十国领导人宣布实质性结束中国—东盟自贸区3.0版谈判，马来西亚发挥2025年东盟轮值主席国作用，积极推动中国—东盟自贸区3.0版落实落地，共同反对贸易保护主义。全面深化《区域全面经济伙伴关系协定》（RCEP），有力带动中马共建“一带一路”高质量发展再上新高度，全面拓展新兴领域互利合作，加强标准和规制领域互融互通，促进贸易便利化及包容发展，为中马合作注入新动能，开辟新路径。
统筹推进重大标志性工程和“小而美”民生项目。在共建“一带一路”合作框架下，中马加快建成马东铁标志性工程，进一步提升东盟立体互联互通网络。同时，打造更多中马共建“一带一路”“小而美”民生项目，深化中马农业领域合作，在种植、贸易合作基础上，针对市场需求发挥各自优势，进一步开展农业技术、农业设备、农业基础设施建设、农产品深加工等方面合作，将中马双赢的“榴莲经济学”推广到更多农业合作领域。
通过合作建设皇京港和升级关丹港，有效提升马来西亚航运货运量，进一步释放中国与马来西亚参与地区产业链分工和国际贸易的潜能，对冲贸易保护主义的不确定性，维护中国—东盟产业链供应链稳定。对于双方相互间出口规模较大的产品，进一步优化和加强产业链垂直分工合作，用好两国产业园区，优化跨境供应链，加快推动中马、中国—东盟市场多元整合，为各自发挥优势创造更加有利条件。在稳定供应链、产业链的基础上构建东盟区域价值链，构建区域内多梯度、强互补的产业网络，实现产业链与全球生产体系对接融合，摆脱全球产业价值链“低端锁定”风险，共同推进中马乃至中国—东盟产品向全球价值链高端攀升。
当前，全球局势变乱交织，逆全球化、保护主义行为冲击中国周边和国际经贸体系秩序。但逆流并非主流，中国与马来西亚携手合作，以高质量共建“一带一路”为主要平台，将让古老的海上丝绸之路焕发新的生机，为中国同周边国家开辟友好合作新境界，为全球南方国家团结合作、共同发展注入正能量。

"BJP vows to act against friend, foe alike if any plaint lodged - The Shillong Times","SHILLONG, April 16: The State BJP will now move beyond mere issue-raising and take concrete action against any political entity, be it ally or opponent, provided a formal complaint is lodged.
State BJP general secretary Wankitbok Pohshna emphasised that without an official complaint, the party has no mandate to initiate inquiries, whether against its own partners or the opposition.
He urged citizens to submit complaints either to the BJP or to the appropriate authorities, assuring that every allegation would be thoroughly examined and pursued with diligence.
Citing the National Herald case as an example, Pohshna noted that the case advanced only after a public interest complaint was filed in 2012, and it has since progressed through the legal system. “Any matter brought before us with the requisite documentation will be taken to its logical conclusion,” he asserted.
Responding to recent allegations of illegal coal mining, Pohshna revealed that the BJP has already formed a fact-finding committee to investigate the matter.
Outlining the party’s internal processes, he said BJP offices across the state are equipped to receive public representations and will coordinate with district administrations and law enforcement agencies as necessary.
Earlier, Pohshna had levelled a series of accusations against the Congress, alleging that its leadership is attempting to distract the public with protests and outrage over minor issues while more serious scandals are unfolding.
He reminded reporters that Congress president Sonia Gandhi and Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha, Rahul Gandhi, are named in the National Herald charge sheet, which he said details a clear paper trail of questionable transactions and asset misuse.
Pohshna further claimed that properties of Associated Journals Limited (AJL), which were originally owned by thousands of freedom-fighter shareholders since 1937, were fraudulently transferred into private hands. He alleged that assets worth over Rs 5,000 crore are now controlled by a single family, calling it “a betrayal of the founding shareholders and the nation’s trust.”
He concluded by directly challenging the Congress: “With so much evidence now public, how can it continue to pose as the standard-bearer of Gandhian truth?”",2025-04-17T01:29:00.000+03:00,https://theshillongtimes.com/2025/04/17/bjp-vows-to-act-against-friend-foe-alike-if-any-plaint-lodged,@ShillongTimesIn,positive

近年来，中国与柬埔寨在两国领导人的战略引领下，建立了牢不可破的“铁杆友谊”。双方在“钻石六边”架构下的务实合作不断深化，“工业发展走廊”和“鱼米走廊”建设持续推进，各领域合作成果丰硕，为两国人民带来了切实利益，成为“合作共赢、共同繁荣”的典范。习近平主席即将对柬埔寨进行国事访问，访问期间，双方将探讨提升中柬关系新定位，就政治互信、互利合作、安全保障、人文交流、战略协作五大领域深入交换意见。相信此次访问将进一步提升中柬两国的战略互信，推动两国各领域全方位的深入合作，为构建高质量、高水平、高标准的新时代中柬命运共同体注入强劲动力。
柬埔寨皇家科学院国际关系研究所所长金平近日在接受经济日报专访时表示，柬中两国传统友谊源远流长，最早可追溯到13世纪。自1958年7月19日两国建交以来，在历代领导人的精心呵护下，柬中友好合作关系经受住了历史的考验。2010年，两国建立全面战略合作伙伴关系。2019年，中国和柬埔寨签署《构建中柬命运共同体行动计划》（2019—2023），柬埔寨成为首个同中国签署构建命运共同体行动计划的国家。2020年，中国与柬埔寨正式签署自由贸易协定，并于2022年正式生效。2023年，双方达成“钻石六边”合作架构协议，签署了《构建新时代中柬命运共同体行动计划（2024—2028）》。这一系列的制度化安排，大大增强了两国关系的韧性和稳定性，为今后的合作拓展了更广阔的空间。
经贸合作已成为两国关系的基石。中国连续多年是柬埔寨最大外资来源国和最大贸易伙伴。中柬自贸协定显著加大了柬农产品和制成品的市场准入，有力促进了双边贸易增长。根据柬埔寨海关总署发布的统计数据，2024年，中柬贸易额达到151亿美元，同比增长23.8%。其中，柬对华出口额达17.5亿美元，同比增长18%；柬自中国进口额达134.3亿美元，同比增长24.6%。2024年在柬埔寨批准的国内外投资项目中，中国投资占到协议总投资额的49.8%。
与此同时，共建“一带一路”倡议也为柬基础设施、能源建设和数字经济发展等作出显著贡献。中柬共建的柬埔寨西哈努克港经济特区已吸引200多家国际企业和机构入驻，创造了3.2万个就业岗位；中企建设运营的柬埔寨首条高速公路——金边至西哈努克港高速公路，将两地通行时间从5小时以上缩短至不到2小时；暹粒吴哥国际机场助力旅游业快速增长，截至去年年底，已开通至8个国家的17条航线。共建“一带一路”框架下的重点项目以及“工业发展走廊”“鱼米走廊”建设对柬经济社会发展起到了重要作用。
双方将“钻石六边”合作与柬“五角战略”对接，在深化经贸合作基础上，不断扩大在教育、文化、旅游、扶贫、医疗援助及军事和安全等领域的合作，两国党际交流、官方和民间团体交流频繁，两国的务实合作有力促进了中柬民心相通。可以说，在柬埔寨的发展之路上，处处可见“中国印记”，这种双边合作的广度和深度，在柬埔寨对外关系史上前所未有，堪称发展中国家之间合作共赢的典范。
中柬两国一贯倡导多边主义、国际关系民主化，共同致力于建立更加公平的国际秩序，坚定维护国际规则和公平正义，反对霸权主义、强权政治，反对单边主义和贸易保护主义。面对变乱交织的国际局势，中国提出了构建周边命运共同体的倡议，作为友好邻邦，柬埔寨各界对此表示欢迎。两国有望进一步深化双边合作，共同维护以世界贸易组织为核心的多边贸易体制，在实现全球治理改革的共同承诺中加强战略合作，共同应对全球性挑战。（本文来源：经济日报 作者：王 涛）

Illinois lawmakers moving forward on public defender reform,"Illinois
Illinois lawmakers moving forward on public defender reform
When Elizabeth Pollock took over as the Champaign County public defender in 2022, one of her team’s attorneys was handling 500 cases by herself in a courtroom that should have been staffed by at least three public defenders.
“That is a recipe for disaster because it’s not just taxing on the attorney, but it means that the client(s) who that attorney is representing are not able to speak with her in a timely fashion; they’re not able to review their cases with her in a timely fashion,” Pollock said in an interview. “We’re talking about months of delay in terms of meeting with attorneys and getting results.”
With many county public defender offices pushed to the limits throughout Illinois, state lawmakers are moving forward on legislation to create a statewide public defender office.
Many public defender offices in Illinois, especially in rural areas, are in desperate need of resources to provide adequate defense services. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1963 on Gideon v. Wainright that anyone accused of a crime has a right to a defense attorney, setting the basis for public defenders that judges often assign to defendants to represent a person for free.
By 2022, St. Clair County Chief Defender Cathy MacElroy said her office was “collapsing” beneath the weight of demand. Attorney were leaving the public defender’s office because the pay was too low and the case load too high and she began asking the 20th judicial circuit to allow her office to withdraw from cases. She had no choice, she said.
“It is not ethically possible for us to provide adequate representation to clients with the amount of cases we have with only five full-time lawyers,” MacElroy said in a 2022 interview with the Belleville News-Democrat.
Even with $200,000 added to the public defender’s budget by the county board, she worried that bail reforms and additional pre-trial hearings would add to the strain.
She wasn’t alone.
A 2021 report commissioned by the Illinois Supreme Court examined nine counties of varying sizes and found each one lacked necessary resources to provide defendants proper legal representation because of high caseloads, a lack of state oversight and long wait times to obtain a lawyer. A task force created after that report recommended Illinois fully fund public defense services and establish a statewide office that provides administrative oversight and resources.
Demand for public defense attorneys has increased in the two years since the Pretrial Fairness Act took effect in 2023. That law requires more in-depth evidence and arguments during first appearance hearings than under the old bond system, where first appearance hearings often lasted just a few minutes while a judge set a bond. Now detention hearings are required to take place within 72 hours of an arrest, meaning public defender services are often needed right away to review early evidence in cases.
Legislation in front of the General Assembly would create the “Office of State Public Defender” which would primarily be responsible for providing public defender offices around the state with more resources. House Bill 3363 passed the House last week on a 72-41 vote. It now heads to the Senate where President Don Harmon, D-Oak Park, has tried to pass similar legislation in recent years.
Illinois has already established similar offices to improve other aspects of criminal court processes, including the Office of State Appellate Defender and the Office of Statewide Pretrial Services.
First steps for the office
If lawmakers approve the bill, the office may provide public defense services — but not for several years. Over the first few years, the office’s primary responsibility would be to assess the needs of public defenders in Illinois and collect data about their workloads.
“We are really lacking any type of data gathering across public defender offices in the state of Illinois because we just have never had the resources to really even count the number of cases that we have,” Pollock said.
The data gathered would guide decision making about where the money should be spent and what types of resources — from more attorneys to case investigators — public defender offices should receive.
The state has appropriated $10 million for public defense services via a fund established in 2023. State funding would provide greater equity for public defenders throughout the state, which typically receive funding from their counties, Pollock said.
“County by county, the budget depends on what that county can provide, and some counties don’t have as much revenue as others and so they just simply cannot afford to provide the resources that the public defenders need to do their jobs,” she said.
Limited data shows all Illinois counties need more public defenders. According to an analysis of county public defender budgets compiled by Northwestern University, no Illinois counties have “sufficient” staffing in public defender offices.
Some positions in public defender offices aren’t filled at all, including 83% of counties that don’t have any investigators in public defender offices, according to researchers.
Most other states also have some level of state oversight and are the primary funding source for public defenders. Illinois doesn’t fall into either category.
The bill would require counties to bump up salaries for public defenders from 90% to 95% of a state’s attorney’s salary, something proponents say will help improve recruitment and retention.
Appointing public defenders
Another key provision of the bill would change how public defenders are selected. Outside of Cook County, top county judges appoint or remove public defenders. Under the bill, a local nominating committee would be tasked with appointing or removing public defenders, which is designed to give the public defenders more independence from the judiciary.
“You’re now arguing in front of a judge who hires you and a judge who fires you, potentially. Whereas a state’s attorney is an elected official and a judge has no power over him or her and no power over their budget,” bill sponsor Rep. Dave Vella, D-Rockford, said in an interview.
Chief judges could still be part of the local committees appointing public defenders, however. But their voice would be one of between four and six members of the commission that selects a county’s public defender. Other local commission members would include attorneys, representatives of law schools or legal professional organizations and former public defender clients.
For now, that process would not be required for counties with fewer than 35,000 people as those counties typically rely on contract attorneys for public defense that split their time in multiple counties. State law currently doesn’t require those smaller counties, which account for more than half of the state’s 102 counties, to have public defender offices. Cook County already has its own appointment process different from the rest of the state.
“The problem is the appearance of impropriety,” Vella said. “We have a system right now in Illinois and in America where defendants and people who are in the system are starting to have some real questions about the fairness of the system.”
Pollock explained it makes sense that judges are part of the process because they see the attorneys perform in the courtroom and might be able to tell who would make a good public defender. But the problem is it could create an appearance for defendants that their public defender might change how they represent someone to make their “boss” — the chief judge — happy.
Former Madison County Public Defender John Rekowski disagreed.
“The judges are in the best position to know the local landscape and know the local bench, know the local climate and pick the person who should furnish those services,” Rekowski said in an interview.
Rekowski and the Illinois State Bar Association are proposing that judges continue appointing the public defender, but the commission has the power to remove the public defender or reappoint the public defender to a new term. Rekowski said limiting the judge’s power over public defenders to just their first appointment removes “any possibility (of) some kind of retribution or intimidation.”
The bill is likely to go through more changes as it heads to the Senate for consideration.",2025-04-17T00:11:00.000+03:00,https://www.bnd.com/news/state/illinois/article304382951.html,Ben Szalinski,positive

chevron-right,"HELENA, Mont. — It’s the final stretch for a bill that would fund increases to beginning teacher pay in Montana. Having passed the House and with one more vote left in the Senate, the Student and Teacher Advancement for Results and Success Act – the STARS Act – may soon become law.
School districts could then choose to dip into funds created by the act, yearly pools of up to about $350,000 depending on district enrollment.
Sen. John Fuller, R-Kalispell, is carrying the bill through the Senate and said during debate on the bill on Tuesday that it’s worth the price tag.
“Some of you may know that I'm so tight, I squeak when I walk, but I do support public education and I support it fiercely.”
To qualify for funding in the coming fiscal year, districts would have to pay educators a salary that is at least 62% of 2025’s average teacher pay.
Box Elder Democrat Sen. Jonathan Windy Boy agreed that $55 million in estimated yearly spending seemed steep, but it’s a step in the right direction.
“This is an issue that we have been looking at on the interim, sitting on the interim budget committee. And I think that the shortfalls that school districts across the state have been experiencing in this last interim. This will help. Probably [will] not make it whole, but at least put back some of the shortfalls that the school districts have been experiencing.”
The bill has been referred to the Senate Finance and Claims Committee where lawmakers will discuss how the bill impacts the state’s two-year budget.

Dover City Councilman Fred Neil Re-Elected at 91 Years Old | Latest News | wboc.com,"DOVER, Del. -- On Wednesday, certified election results confirmed Dover City Councilman Fred Neil's reelection to serve the city's third district.
At 91, Neil is the oldest serving council member in Dover City Council history. He says the number is simply ""a statement of his age.""
""I can't dance as fast as I used to, but I still can dance,"" says Neil with a laugh. ""The sense of humor is still with me, and I usually use it judiciously when things get a little tight in the council.""
With nearly 67% of the votes in the third district race, Neil beat Jo Ann Mather to reclaim his seat.
""If you look to see what I've accomplished within a ten-year period, if that was satisfactory to them, why stop?"" asks Neil. ""I'm so glad that I'm elected with my constituents because we have the experience, and we already started to do things that we need to do.""
Neil says he will continue to prioritize Dover's affordable housing issue and find a way to limit skyrocketing rental costs.
""The gap between people who are low and fixed income is growing farther and farther in terms of what they can afford,"" Neil says. ""You can't build it fast enough in order to get ahead of the problem.""
Neil says this will likely be his final term.
""I'm going to be a public servant, and that's the idea behind it,"" Neil says.

东安动力预计一季报扭亏为盈,"点赞 分享 证券时报记者 孙宪超
东安动力（600178）4月16日晚披露2025年一季度业绩预盈公告，公司预计2025年第一季度实现净利润在360万元左右，与上年同期相比实现扭亏为盈。东安动力一季报业绩预盈的主要原因是本期产量增加，单位产品固定成本摊销减少。
东安动力拥有自然吸气、增压直喷和新能源增程动力三大发动机产品平台以及手动变速器、自动变速器和DHT三大变速器产品平台，包括M、N、D系列发动机和AT、DHT变速器，致力于为高端乘用车、轻型和中型商用车、新能源汽车等提供发动机、变速器及动力总成一体化解决方案。
东安动力4月7日晚披露2024年年度报告，报告期内，公司实现营业收入46.18亿元，同比下降14.55%；实现净利润573万元，同比增长41.39%；基本每股收益0.01元。分配预案为每10股派发现金人民币0.05元（含税）。
东安动力4月16日披露投资者关系活动记录表显示，公司于4月15日通过电话会议接受了中银基金的调研。
公司近两年产品以传统发动机和增程式发动机为主，变速器方面主要是6AT变速箱。今年开始，DHT产品将小批量生产。东安动力介绍，2024年发动机和变速器销量49.35万台，较2023年有较大下降，主要受商用车市场低迷影响，尤其是轻卡领域电动化渗透加快，导致公司市场占有率下降，未完成年初目标。
东安动力称，公司现有产能能够满足市场需求，且产能均可通过节拍优化、延长工作时间等提升。另外，公司基于产能利用情况，筹划后续生产线建设，公司厂区有预留场地。2022~2024年公司投资新基地建设，用于增程产品生产线建设，其间投资较大。2025年投资规模较小，后续公司可根据需要，进行产能提升。
乘用车发动机方面，东安动力主要客户为长安汽车，2024年为长安汽车配套的2.0T发动机约10万台以上。此外还为东风岚图配套1.5T增程发动机，主要应用于东风岚图FREE车型。商用车发动机主要配套轻卡，客户主要为福田汽车、河北长安等。
当前发动机行业毛利普遍较低，近几年，公司毛利率因销量下降、生产线折旧增加以及会计科目调整等因素影响，持续下降。随着销量提升，毛利率有望提升。乘用车毛利率相对商用车稍好，新品毛利率初期表现不佳，后续随量增加有望改善。变速器业务毛利率相对高一些，主要是海外市场表现较好。
2024年，东安动力海外业务收入占公司营业收入的比例为15%，产品主要为自动变速器。2025年，公司将实现发动机和变速器的整体出口，海外收入有望进一步提高，公司规划长远目标为海外业务收入占比达到30%。

PANAMA CITY, Fla. (WJHG/WECP) - A portion of Highway 90 in Walton County will soon be designated as Deputy William May Memorial Highway.
Florida Senator Jay Trumbull said on Thursday that the legislature will be introducing an amendment to designate a roadway to honor Deputy May.
“This is a small but meaningful way we can recognize Deputy May’s incredible service and sacrifice. We remain hopeful for continued support from both the Senate and House as we work to advance this tribute to the Governor’s desk—honoring Deputy May’s legacy in the community he gave his life to protect,” said Trumbull.

Alta afluencia de pasajeros en la Estación de Buses de Asunción tras liberación de horarios,"Desde tempranas horas de este miércoles, la Estación de Buses de Asunción experimenta una notable afluencia de pasajeros, en el marco de la liberación de horarios para los buses anunciada por la Dirección Nacional de Transporte (Dinatrán).
Con la medida en vigor desde hoy, las empresas de transporte pueden operar sin restricciones horarias, lo que genera un aumento significativo en la frecuencia de salida de las unidades y una mayor movilidad de personas, especialmente hacia el interior del país, aunque también la salida hacia el exterior aumentaron.

Según se pudo observar, largas filas y constante movimiento marcaron la jornada en la principal estación terrestre de la capital. Mucha gente llegó para comprar pasaje y viajar sentado, en especial aquellos que irán a los lugares más alejados. Como todos los años, la Semana Santa genera una alta migración hacia el interior del país.
La Dinatrán informó que, ante este escenario, se intensificarán los controles en las principales rutas del país con el objetivo de verificar el cumplimiento de las normas de seguridad, habilitación de los vehículos y documentación correspondiente. “Vamos a estar muy atentos al comportamiento del flujo vehicular y al cumplimiento de la reglamentación vigente”, señalaron desde la institución.
Por otro lado, se confirmó que las tarifas del pasaje no sufrirán modificaciones, a pesar del aumento en la demanda. Esta decisión busca mantener el acceso equitativo al servicio de transporte en un contexto de creciente movimiento ciudadano.
Las autoridades recomiendan a los pasajeros tomar previsiones y acudir con antelación a la estación, considerando el alto volumen de personas que se espera durante los próximos días.

"Tennessee General Assembly approves $59.8B state budget, around $7B larger than the previous year","NASHVILLE, Tenn. — Tennessee lawmakers have approved the state's budget for the 2025-2026 fiscal year, planning to spend around $7 billion more than the previous year. The latest spending plan comes in at around $59.8 billion.
Lawmakers said the spending plan recognizes a 2% growth rate and shifts around $19.94 million in funds originally slated to be recurring to be nonrecurring, giving the state more leverage to manage or cut some long-term spending.
A release from lawmakers said the
state budget would create a $42.5 million nonrecurring grant pool aimed at supporting community services. That pool has $20 million in funding for volunteer fire departments, $5 million for rescue squads and $5 million for emergency medical services. Funding is also available for senior centers, museums and courthouse restorations.
The pool also sets aside $500,000 for the Second Harvest Food Bank of East Tennessee, which said in late March that federal departments had
canceled 21 tractor-trailers of food, valued at around $722,200.
The budget also provides $26 million in nonrecurring funds for survivors of Hurricane Helene, and $20 million set aside for a match to federal disaster relief efforts.
It also sets aside $145.9 million to
fund universal school vouchers, a controversial proposal that was passed during a special legislative session earlier in the year. The program allows families to apply for vouchers of more than $7,000 in public funds to be spent on private school costs. Critics of the program said it moves funds away from already underfunded public schools.
A release from lawmakers also said the budget sets aside $62.7 million for primary and secondary school infrastructure, as well as an extra $244 million for public school funding through the state's Tennessee Investment in Student Achievement formula.
The budget sets aside $500,000 in one-time funds for the University of Tennessee Law Enforcement Innovation Center, and $400,000 for the East Tennessee Regional Forensic Facility and Training Program.
The University of Tennessee System's campuses are expected to get around $930 million from the state, and more than a third of those funds will go towards its Knoxville campus. Around another $11.3 million will go to the UT Space Institute, and $5.8 million will go towards the university system's research initiatives. The school's veterinary medicine program will get around $35.7 million, and its agricultural extension service is expected to receive around $53.1 million.
The Tennessee Department of Health is slated to get around $368 million, and its Department of Human Services is set to get around $307.4 million. The Tennessee Department of Military will get around $42.1 million, and the Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services will get around $436.5 million.
The spending plan also moves $35.6 million into the state's ""Rainy Day Fund,"" bringing that fund to nearly $2.2 billion in total and making it the largest in state history, according to the release.
Ahead of the vote, Democratic lawmakers asked the state's Department of Finance about how Tennessee could be impacted by federal cuts, saying that federal funds made up about 41.9% of the previous year's budget. Lawmakers said they wanted to understand the scope that federal cuts could have, so families would not ""bear the burden of federal instability.""
Information about the extent of federal funding in this year's budget proposal was not immediately available.",2025-04-17T01:22:00.000+03:00,https://www.wbir.com/article/news/politics/tennessee-legislature-approves-2025-2026-fiscal-year-budget/51-5571c7cd-a547-4217-a6cb-2adfcb31d409,Chris Salvemini,positive

Mayor appoints Dr. Randal Collins as Director of the Department of Emergency Management,"HONOLULU – Mayor Rick Blangiardi today announced the appointment of Dr. Randal A. Collins, CEM, as the new Director of the City and County of Honolulu’s Department of Emergency Management (DEM). Dr. Collins brings decades of experience in emergency management, crisis response, and strategic leadership. Acting Director Jennifer Walter will remain with the department as Deputy Director, ensuring continuity and stability in leadership.
“We are thrilled to welcome Randy Collins to our team,” said Mayor Blangiardi. “His extensive background in emergency management, leadership development, and crisis response will be invaluable as we continue to enhance O‘ahu’s preparedness and resilience. I am also grateful to Jennifer Walter for her leadership as Acting Director and am pleased that she will continue to serve in a key role.”
Dr. Collins has an impressive career spanning multiple sectors, including government, academia, and private industry. He most recently served as the Emergency Management Senior Director for the NEOM Project in Saudi Arabia, where he led strategic crisis management initiatives and established NEOM’s first Weather Service. He is also the President and CEO of the Incident Management Teams Association, working closely with FEMA and NEMA to develop national emergency management programs.
In addition to his field experience, Dr. Collins is an Associate Adjunct Professor of Emergency Management at the University of Southern California, where he teaches and develops graduate-level courses. He has held key leadership roles, including Emergency Management Coordinator for the City of El Segundo, National Director of American Humane Rescue, and Deputy Director of Operations and Preparedness for Indianapolis-Marion County Emergency Management.
As a certified emergency manager, he has led responses to major disasters, including Hurricane Sandy and significant tornado outbreaks. With over 30 federally declared disaster responses, he has built a reputation for strategic decision-making, interagency coordination, and implementing innovative solutions to complex challenges.
“I am deeply grateful to Mayor Blangiardi for this opportunity to serve the City and County of Honolulu in such a critical role,” said Dr. Collins. “Emergency management is about staying ahead of the next challenge—bringing together the best ideas, the best people, and the best strategies to protect the lives, livelihoods, and the quality of life of the people of Honolulu. I look forward to building strong partnerships and modernizing how we prepare for, respond to, and cope with emergencies.”
Dr. Collins, a former Staff Sergeant in the Marine Corps, holds a Doctor of Education in Organizational Change and Leadership and a Master of Leadership from the University of Southern California, as well as a Bachelor of Science in Criminal Justice from the University of Indianapolis.
His first day in his new role will be Thursday, May 1, 2025.

Marco Rubio Shuts Down Agency Responsible for Censoring Americans,"Good news, everyone! Secretary of State Marco Rubio has essentially shut down the State Department's Counter Foreign Information Manipulation and Interference agency, formerly the Global Engagement Center. These were the people censoring you on social media for ""disinformation.""
BREAKING 🚨 The US State Department has just placed all 30 full-time staff at the Global Engagement Center’s remnant known as R-FIMI on leave, eliminated all 50 full-time staff positions and delivered a notice to Congress ending R-FIMI’s existence and $65 million in funding 🧵👇
— Mike Benz (@MikeBenzCyber)[April 16, 2025]
Nice.
This historic development today was made possible by
— Mike Benz (@MikeBenzCyber)[@SecRubio]and Acting Under Secretary for Public Diplomacy[@DarrenJBeattie], as part of a complete restructuring of the State Department’s activities and capacities to prevent the abuses and weaponization of the past.[April 16, 2025]
The development today is the State Department’s initiation of a RIF (Reduction In Force) that will permanently end the positions at GEC / R-FIMI, so there is no more reshuffling of positions or simple renamings of the office to carry out the same malign censorship efforts.
— Mike Benz (@MikeBenzCyber)[April 16, 2025]
While GEC was formally sunset late last year after a showdown in Congress to deny its reauthorization, the Biden State Department got around this by putting GEC’s staff and operations under a new name: the Counter Foreign Information Manipulation and Interference office (R-FIMI).
— Mike Benz (@MikeBenzCyber)[April 16, 2025]
Last month,
— Mike Benz (@MikeBenzCyber)[@SecRubio]and Acting Under Secretary for Public Diplomacy[@DarrenJBeattie]terminated 100+ contractors that R-FIMI worked with, which formed a deep partner web between censorship operatives in the private sector and the muscle of the US gov’t to go after speech.[April 16, 2025]
But in gov’t, it’s easier to terminate a contractor than a public employee. The structuring of today’s move as Stage 1 of a RIF to eliminate the office and dissolve the office entirely prevents the possibility of bureaucratic delays that come from contesting firings.
— Mike Benz (@MikeBenzCyber)[April 16, 2025]
Rubio himself chimed in:
Over the last decade, Americans have been slandered, fired, charged, and even jailed for simply voicing their opinions.

That ends today.
I am announcing the closure of the[@StateDept]'s Counter Foreign Information Manipulation and Interference, formerly the Global Engagement…[https://t.co/ucdBPmPJC1][April 16, 2025]
… Center (GEC), which cost taxpayers more than $50 million per year and actively silenced and censored the voices of Americans they were supposed to be serving.
Good. We managed to send Joe Biden's ""Disinformation Governance Board"" packing, and there's no need for the ""Global Engagement Center."" Free speech is back.
God bless you, sir.
— Barto Blanco (@elbartoblanco)[April 16, 2025]
Thank you!

You are so exceeding expectations Secretary Rubio. Totally agree with everything you are doing.
— Debra Davis (@DebD266)[April 16, 2025]
When do you refer them to the DOJ for criminal prosecution? They conspired (RICO) to deprive over half the nation of our God-given rights.
— B_Meeseeks (@B_meeseek)[April 16, 2025]
A taxpayer-funded office, spending $50–61 million annually that suppresses American voices while claiming to combat foreign disinformation fees like yet another case of the government operating behind closed doors. No wonder many people were unaware of its existence.
— AgaObF (@AgaObF)[April 16, 2025]
They weren't aware of its existence until they were censored or shadowbanned.
Wonderful! Overdue correction.

GWM desembarca 900 veículos em porto de Vitória; mantém plano de abertura de fábrica em SP,"GWM desembarca 900 veículos em porto de Vitória; mantém plano de abertura de fábrica em SP
Um navio cargueiro com 900 veículos da GWM 601633 chegou ao porto de Vitória nesta semana depois de ter saído de Xangai em meados de março, confirmou a montadora chinesa nesta quarta-feira.
Imagens da Reuters mostram o pátio do porto com filas de veículos utilitários esportivos. Segundo a montadora, os modelos são da linha Haval H6, uma das mais vendidas da marca no país. O navio também trouxe o utilitário offroad híbrido Tank 300, lançado no início do mês no Brasil, disse a GWM.
A montadora esclareceu que o cargueiro de bandeira norueguesa que saiu de Xangai em 18 de março é do tipo Ro-Ro, comumente usado no transporte de veículos e equipamentos como maquinário agrícola e de mineração, e que o navio não é de uso exclusivo da GWM, sendo compartilhado por outras empresas.
A GWM registrou vendas de 5.767 unidades do Haval H6 no Brasil no primeiro trimestre, na frente de modelos mais tradicionais do segmento, como o Renault Duster, segundo dados da associação de concessionários Fenabrave.
A montadora mantém planos de abertura de sua fábrica em Iracemápolis, no interior de São Paulo, em meados deste ano, segundo o diretor de assuntos institucionais da GWM Brasil, Ricardo Bastos. A unidade, comprada da Mercedes-Benz em 2021, está ""na reta final de preparação"", afirmou.
Quando a fábrica ficar pronta, a GWM vai produzir o Haval H6 e, numa segunda etapa, uma picape, de acordo com o executivo.
As turbulências tarifárias criadas pela guerra comercial iniciada pelo presidente dos EUA, Donald Trump, não alterou o projeto, disse Bastos, em resposta a perguntas da Reuters.
""O governo brasileiro está lidando muito bem com essa situação. Entendemos que a direção adotada pelo vice-presidente Geraldo Alckmin (também ministro do Desenvolvimento, Indústria e Comércio) mostra que o Brasil está respeitando as regras já definidas"", disse o executivo, se referindo ao aumento gradual do imposto de importação pelo governo federal no segmento de híbridos e elétricos a partir do início do ano passado.

"L'utile Q1 di TSMC è destinato a salire, ma le politiche di Trump ne offuscano il futuro - Notizie TradingView","L'utile Q1 di TSMC è destinato a salire, ma le politiche di Trump ne offuscano il futuro
- Gli analisti si aspettano un utile del primo trimestre di 10,9 miliardi di dollari
- Il ricavi del 1° trimestre balza, battendo le aspettative del mercato
- L'amministrazione Trump rappresenta una grande incertezza per TSMC
- Earnings call alle 0600 GMT di giovedì
TSMC 2330, il principale produttore globale di chip avanzati utilizzati per le applicazioni di intelligenza artificiale, si appresta a comunicare giovedì un balzo del 57% dell'utile del primo trimestre, anche se probabilmente segnalerà i rischi derivanti dalle politiche commerciali del presidente degli Stati Uniti Donald Trump (link).
Il più grande produttore di chip a contratto del mondo, i cui clienti includono Apple AAPL e Nvidia NVDA, ha beneficiato della tendenza a integrare funzioni di intelligenza artificiale nei prodotti online. Ma l'azienda deve affrontare i venti contrari derivanti dalle tariffe di importazione imposte da Trump (link) e dalle sue critiche al dominio di Taiwan nell'industria dei chip.
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co 2330 dovrebbe registrare un utile netto di 354,6 miliardi di dollari (10,92 miliardi di dollari) per i tre mesi conclusi il 31 marzo, secondo una SmartEstimate di LSEG elaborata da 18 analisti. Le SmartEstimate danno maggior peso alle previsioni degli analisti che sono più costantemente accurate.
Questa stima si confronta con un utile netto del primo trimestre del 2024 di 225,5 miliardi di dollari.
TSMC ha speso miliardi di dollari in nuovi stabilimenti all'estero, anche se ha detto che la maggior parte della produzione rimarrà a Taiwan. Il mese scorso ha annunciato con Trump alla Casa Bianca piani di investimento negli Stati Uniti per 100 miliardi di dollari su , oltre a 65 miliardi di dollari promessi per tre stabilimenti nello stato dell'Arizona.
Trump ha sia elogiato l'industria dei chip di Taiwan che minacciato di imporre tariffe.
La scorsa settimana Trump ha detto di aver detto a TSMC che avrebbe dovuto pagare una tassa fino al 100% se non avesse costruito fabbriche negli Stati Uniti.
L'amministrazione Trump sta anche esaminando l'importazione di chip , insieme ai prodotti farmaceutici, nel tentativo di imporre dazi su entrambi in base al fatto che l'ampia dipendenza dalla produzione estera di semiconduttori e medicinali è una minaccia per la sicurezza nazionale.
La settimana scorsa TSMC ha registrato un aumento del ricavi del primo trimestre in dollari di Taiwan, leggermente superiore alle aspettative del mercato. L'azienda fornirà le proprie previsioni di ricavi in dollari statunitensi nel corso della telefonata sugli utili trimestrali, prevista per le ore 6.00 GMT di giovedì.
Aggiornerà anche le prospettive per il trimestre in corso e per l'intero anno, comprese le investimenti previste per l'aumento della produzione.
Durante l'ultima conferenza stampa di gennaio, TSMC aveva detto di aspettarsi una spesa in conto capitale tra i 38 e i 42 miliardi di dollari per l'anno in corso, con un aumento del 41% rispetto all'anno scorso.
Se in passato il boom dell'intelligenza artificiale aveva contribuito a far salire il prezzo delle azioni di TSMC, quest'anno le azioni sono scese del 20% a causa dell'incertezza sulle politiche commerciali e tariffarie degli Stati Uniti.
A Taiwan, l'azienda è così importante per l'economia orientata all'esportazione che viene spesso definita colloquialmente come la ""montagna sacra che protegge il Paese"".

美债风暴前一个月，美国海外债主持有的美债创2021年6月来最大增幅_新浪财经_新浪网,"下载新浪财经APP，了解全球实时汇率
　　来源：华尔街见闻
　　美东时间4月16日周三，美国财政部公布国际资本流动报告（TIC）显示， 今年2月美国的海外债主们持有的美国国债显著增长，为2021年6月以来的最大增幅。 加拿大和日本是该月净买入量位居前列的国家， 而该月正值美债市场近期动荡的前夕。
　　截至今年2月末，美国以外国家持有的美国国债总额增加2900亿美元，达到创纪录的8.82万亿美元。当月，外国买家净购买了1062亿美元的长期美债和732亿美元的短期美债。
　　 日本2月所持美国国债增加466亿美元，是自2020年2月以来的最大增幅， 至1.13万亿美元，为2024年4月以来的最高水平。自2019年6月持仓超越中国大陆以来，日本一直是美国国债最大的海外持有国。
　　华尔街见闻网站此前提到，去年日本的美债持仓变动，一度被视为干预汇市压力下的调整。为了稳定日元汇率采取的干预需要日本掌握充足“弹药”，因此不得不减持包括美债在内的美元资产筹资。例如，有媒体援引数据称，去年7月日本投入366亿美元干预汇市。不过，去年8月和9月，日元兑美元强劲反弹，日本政府暂时没有支持日元的需求，失去了抛美债的一大动力。
　　 中国大陆2月所持美债增加235亿美元，至7843亿美元。 当月中国净卖出了48亿美元的长期美国国债，同时净买入了151亿美元的短期国债。整体持有量的增长也部分反映了2月美国国债价格的上涨。
　　从2022年4月起，中国大陆的美债持仓一直低于1万亿美元，截至今年2月，仍是仅次于日本的第二大美债持有国家地区。大体来说，中国大陆的美债持仓增加的月份与当月美债价格上涨吻合。
　　分析普遍认为，鉴于中美关系变化和外储资产配置多元化的趋势，中国的美国国债持仓仍可能稳步下降。未来中国持仓的波动很大程度上仍受中美关系影响。
　　近年来，中国大陆减持美债更多来自外储资产多元化配置的需要，提升黄金配置占比就是促进多元化配置的一种体现。截至去年4月，中国央行曾创纪录地连续18个月增持黄金，此后一度暂时收手，不过近来又恢复购入黄金的操作。本月稍早公布的数据显示，3月末 中国黄金 储备为7370万盎司，较2月末的7361万盎司增加9万盎司，这是自2024年11月以来，中国央行连续第五个月增持黄金储备。
　　加拿大在1月净卖出美债后，2月美债持仓大幅反弹，净买入465亿美元的长期美债。有分析人士指出，今年1月，美国总统特朗普向加拿大施压，目前双边紧张局势进一步加剧。
　　英国是第三大美债海外债主，2月持有量增加了101亿美元，达7503亿美元。
　　开曼群岛（被认为是对冲基金等杠杆投资者的热门注册地）2月美债持有量增加了133亿美元，达到4178亿美元。市场人士表示，近期美国国债市场的波动部分源于对冲基金解除所谓的“基差交易”策略。
　　周三的数据还显示，阿联酋今年前两个月的美债持仓大幅增加近430亿美元，总额达到1199亿美元，几乎是去年1月时的两倍。
　　 分析称，最新的TIC数据反映了特朗普宣布大规模加征关税约一个月前，外国投资者对美债的强烈需求。在其4月2日宣布关税措施后，29万亿美元的美国国债市场遭遇了自2001年以来最严重的抛售。
　　未来几个月的TIC数据将被密切关注，以判断各国是否正在减少美债持有量。虽然4月的美债持仓数据要等到6月才会公布，但部分市场参与者对此说法持怀疑态度。从长期趋势看，外国投资者在美国国债市场中的占比已经从2008年超过一半的峰值下降，彭博汇编数据显示，近年来该占比约为30%。
　　美国财政部的TIC数据还显示：
2月份，包括长期证券、美国短期证券、以及银行资金流的所有外资净流入总额为2847亿美元。 其中，私人外资净流入为2293亿美元，官方外资净流入为554亿美元。 2月份，外国居民增持了美国长期证券，净买入规模为1427亿美元。其中，外国私人投资者的净买入为1661亿美元，而外国官方机构则净卖出234亿美元。 美国居民在1月份增持了长期外国证券，净买入规模为307亿美元。 经过调整后，例如估计外国投资组合通过股票互换收购美国股票，1月份外国对长期证券的净卖出总额估计为1120亿美元。 外国居民增持了短期证券美国国库券732亿美元。外国居民持有的所有以美元计价的短期美国证券和其他托管负债增加了799亿美元。 银行自身对外国居民的以美元计价的净负债增加了928亿美元。 　　美国财政部今年3月的TIC数据，定于2025年5月16日发布。

中柬友谊是合作共赢典范|柬埔寨_新浪财经_新浪网,"近年来，中国与柬埔寨在两国领导人的战略引领下，建立了牢不可破的“铁杆友谊”。双方在“钻石六边”架构下的务实合作不断深化，“工业发展走廊”和“鱼米走廊”建设持续推进，各领域合作成果丰硕，为两国人民带来了切实利益，成为“合作共赢、共同繁荣”的典范。习近平主席即将对柬埔寨进行国事访问，访问期间，双方将探讨提升中柬关系新定位，就政治互信、互利合作、安全保障、人文交流、战略协作五大领域深入交换意见。相信此次访问将进一步提升中柬两国的战略互信，推动两国各领域全方位的深入合作，为构建高质量、高水平、高标准的新时代中柬命运共同体注入强劲动力。
柬埔寨皇家科学院国际关系研究所所长金平近日在接受经济日报专访时表示，柬中两国传统友谊源远流长，最早可追溯到13世纪。自1958年7月19日两国建交以来，在历代领导人的精心呵护下，柬中友好合作关系经受住了历史的考验。2010年，两国建立全面战略合作伙伴关系。2019年，中国和柬埔寨签署《构建中柬命运共同体行动计划》（2019—2023），柬埔寨成为首个同中国签署构建命运共同体行动计划的国家。2020年，中国与柬埔寨正式签署自由贸易协定，并于2022年正式生效。2023年，双方达成“钻石六边”合作架构协议，签署了《构建新时代中柬命运共同体行动计划（2024—2028）》。这一系列的制度化安排，大大增强了两国关系的韧性和稳定性，为今后的合作拓展了更广阔的空间。
经贸合作已成为两国关系的基石。中国连续多年是柬埔寨最大外资来源国和最大贸易伙伴。中柬自贸协定显著加大了柬农产品和制成品的市场准入，有力促进了双边贸易增长。根据柬埔寨海关总署发布的统计数据，2024年，中柬贸易额达到151亿美元，同比增长23.8%。其中，柬对华出口额达17.5亿美元，同比增长18%；柬自中国进口额达134.3亿美元，同比增长24.6%。2024年在柬埔寨批准的国内外投资项目中，中国投资占到协议总投资额的49.8%。
与此同时，共建“一带一路”倡议也为柬基础设施、能源建设和数字经济发展等作出显著贡献。中柬共建的柬埔寨西哈努克港经济特区已吸引200多家国际企业和机构入驻，创造了3.2万个就业岗位；中企建设运营的柬埔寨首条高速公路——金边至西哈努克港高速公路，将两地通行时间从5小时以上缩短至不到2小时；暹粒吴哥国际机场助力旅游业快速增长，截至去年年底，已开通至8个国家的17条航线。共建“一带一路”框架下的重点项目以及“工业发展走廊”“鱼米走廊”建设对柬经济社会发展起到了重要作用。
双方将“钻石六边”合作与柬“五角战略”对接，在深化经贸合作基础上，不断扩大在教育、文化、旅游、扶贫、医疗援助及军事和安全等领域的合作，两国党际交流、官方和民间团体交流频繁，两国的务实合作有力促进了中柬民心相通。可以说，在柬埔寨的发展之路上，处处可见“中国印记”，这种双边合作的广度和深度，在柬埔寨对外关系史上前所未有，堪称发展中国家之间合作共赢的典范。
中柬两国一贯倡导多边主义、国际关系民主化，共同致力于建立更加公平的国际秩序，坚定维护国际规则和公平正义，反对霸权主义、强权政治，反对单边主义和贸易保护主义。面对变乱交织的国际局势，中国提出了构建周边命运共同体的倡议，作为友好邻邦，柬埔寨各界对此表示欢迎。两国有望进一步深化双边合作，共同维护以世界贸易组织为核心的多边贸易体制，在实现全球治理改革的共同承诺中加强战略合作，共同应对全球性挑战。（本文来源：经济日报 作者：王 涛）",2025-04-17T01:43:00.000+03:00,https://finance.sina.com.cn/jjxw/2025-04-17/doc-inetmkha6209367.shtml,sina.com.cn,positive

中国援塞体育场维修项目顺利移交|桑戈尔_新浪财经_新浪网,"近日，中国援塞内加尔4个体育场维修项目竣工移交仪式在塞首都达喀尔市中心的桑戈尔体育场举行。该项目自2022年开工，涵盖桑戈尔体育场及考拉克、久尔贝勒、济金绍尔3个地方体育场的升级改造。其中，桑戈尔体育场于20世纪80年代由中国政府援建，经过此次结构加固、设施更新等系统性改造，成为该国最现代化的体育场之一。其余3座地方场馆也得到升级，为推动塞内加尔全民健身事业发展注入强劲动能。
翻新后的体育场建筑宏伟、设施先进，工程质量得到当地广泛认可和称赞。移交仪式上，塞内加尔青年、体育和文化部部长哈迪·盖伊表示，“今天的活动不仅是工程移交仪式，更是彰显塞中友谊的重要时刻。桑戈尔体育场自20世纪80年代由中国援建以来，始终见证着塞中两国的深厚情谊。今天，它以崭新的面貌重新绽放光彩，离不开中方的慷慨支持和塞中双方建设者的辛勤付出。这座场馆的升级改造，不仅提升了设施条件，更体现出两国在体育、文化领域合作的持续深化”。
中国驻塞内加尔使馆临时代办李艳表示，援塞4个体育场维修项目是新世纪以来中国在塞实施的规模最大的援助工程，项目顺利移交标志着中塞务实合作迈上新台阶。中国将一如既往坚定支持塞内加尔经济社会发展，愿与塞方携手，将包括体育在内的多领域合作推向新高度，开创两国关系更加紧密、更加丰富的新篇章。
据了解，施工团队 中国建筑 集团克服场地分散、工程复杂等难题，实现高效履约。桑戈尔体育场原钢罩棚锈蚀变形，存在垮塌风险，总拆除面积达4015平方米。施工团队通过三维建模对拆除过程进行全流程应力模拟，采用分段切割工艺控制切割顺序与吊装点位，仅用38天便完成拆除任务。新建罩棚采用大跨度空间桁架体系，通过数字化手段优化吊装路径，创新应用可移动焊接操作平台，实现1600余吨钢结构构件毫米级精准安装。据统计，桑戈尔体育场总计5076块预制混凝土看台板中，97%存在贯穿性裂缝、混凝土剥落及钢筋锈蚀等结构性病害，施工团队自主研发自适应调节钢制模具，实现作业流程标准化，节约工期45天，质量合格率显著提升。2024年中非合作论坛期间，塞内加尔总统法耶高度赞扬中国企业在施工过程中展现的专业能力和技术水平。
项目实施过程中，施工团队积极承担社会责任，累计为当地创造500余个就业岗位，其中技术岗位占比80%；向当地学校捐赠照明灯具，联合中方援塞医疗队开展义诊，被当地媒体称赞为“有温度的援助”。（经济日报驻达喀尔记者 林家全）",2025-04-17T01:44:00.000+03:00,https://finance.sina.com.cn/jjxw/2025-04-17/doc-inetmkha6209594.shtml,sina.com.cn,positive

Governor says she will work with Senate to restore budget priorities
Gov. Kelly Ayotte will mark 100 days in office this weekend, and she said she is proud of her achievements while noting that she's not on board with some of the deep budget cuts proposed by House lawmakers.
Ayotte said that one major achievement she can point to in her first 100 days is the repeal of the 2018 bail law that made it much easier for suspects to avoid jail after arrest.
""If you're a multiple offender, the presumption is that you're going to be held, and if you've skipped out on bail before, there's going to be much stronger consequences for that,"" Ayotte said.
In a one-on-one interview with News 9, Ayotte said her top priority right now is the state budget. She proposed belt-tightening in February, but she will be working with the state Senate to restore much of what was in her budget, including top priorities such as mental health funding, which was cut by House Republicans, citing inadequate funds.

""I can tell you that after the House passed the budget, the way that I put our revenue estimates together, with the head of the Department of Revenue Administration Commissioner Stepp along with the state's chief economist, Brian Gottlob, to get their best opinion on where revenue would be for the next biennium. That is what was contained in my budget,"" Ayotte said. ""After I looked at the House revenue estimates that were passed, I met with them again, and I asked them, 'Was I right? Where are we?' And I can tell you that they believe that the estimates that the House used are too low.""
Tariffs are unsettling markets and increasing costs for some New Hampshire businesses. Ayotte said she still trusts that President Donald Trump will be able to strike a better deal.
""My hope is there will be a resolution of this, that there will be certainty, and we will work this out in a way that is good for New Hampshire,"" she said.",2025-04-17T01:34:00.000+03:00,https://www.wmur.com/article/kelly-ayotte-100-days-new-hampshire-41625/64506383,Adam Sexton,positive

A mudança foi sancionada pelo prefeito Rogério Santos (Republicanos), com base em um projeto de lei da vereadora Débora Camilo (PSOL). No domingo (13), moradores e autoridades participaram da troca simbólica da placa da via.
✅ Clique aqui para seguir o novo canal do g1 Santos no WhatsApp.
A nova identificação foi oficializada pela Lei 4.543. A travessa, situada nos fundos do Museu Pelé, entre as ruas do Comércio e Tuyuti, agora conta com uma placa com a inscrição: “Travessa Anísio José da Costa – angolano, quilombola e trabalhador do Porto de Santos”.
Anteriormente, o local homenageava Comendador Netto, comerciante e construtor da região, dono de uma senzala com 217 escravizados e atuante no tráfico de africanos escravizados.
Quem foi Anísio José da Costa?
Anísio era angolano e, ainda escravizado, fugiu para o Quilombo do Jabaquara, em Santos, onde viveu até a abolição. Trabalhou como ensacador no Porto de Santos até os 108 anos e se tornou símbolo de força e longevidade.
Aos 90 anos, formou família e teve sete filhos até sua morte, aos 110 anos, em 1940, segundo reportagem de A Tribuna publicada em 25 de abril daquele ano.
Uma de suas filhas, Helena — carinhosamente chamada de “tia Lena” — completou 100 anos em março de 2025. Ela mora na mesma casa do pai, no Embaré.
Homenagem
Durante a cerimônia de troca da placa, foi feita uma homenagem à trajetória de Helena e da família. O evento contou com a presença de escritores da Quilombagem Literária e membros da Velha Guarda da escola de samba X-9, campeã do Carnaval de Santos em 2025.
A ação teve apoio da Coordenadoria de Promoção à Igualdade Racial e Étnica (Copire), do Conselho Municipal de Participação e Desenvolvimento da Comunidade Negra (CMPDCNPIR) e da Secretaria da Mulher, Cidadania, Diversidade e Direitos Humanos (Semulher). Também participaram o projeto Quilombagem e escola: da memória à história pública e o Comitê Chaguinhas.
Reparação histórica
Segundo a vereadora Débora Camilo, a mudança representa uma reparação histórica. “Propomos a alteração do logradouro citado para homenagear um quilombola que veio escravizado para o Brasil e que aqui construiu sua família e uma história de resistência, apesar das injustiças praticadas contra ele e contra todo o povo preto”, afirmou.
Ela reforçou que Santos é um dos maiores símbolos de resistência do país. “Nada mais justo que aqueles que lutaram pela liberdade e resistiram a todas essas violências sejam homenageados, para que nunca se esqueça e nunca mais aconteça”, disse.

Moose Lake inmates make history by opening first American Legion Post inside a Minnesota correctional facility - CBS Minnesota,"Inmates at a state prison in Moose Lake are making history, as an American Legion Post has opened up inside the facility.
""Those of us who are veterans, the oath that we took does not have an expiration date. We want to keep on serving and we found this way to do this here,"" said Thomas Young.
Young is among a group of veterans at Moose Lake Correctional Facility who are charter members of the first American Legion Post inside a Minnesota Correctional Facility.
""We have answered the call to serve before and that is something that never leaves you,"" said Mark Altenhofen.
It's called Moose Lake Fires Post 1918, named after the historic fire that swept through the community and claimed one thousand lives. It's a nod to the area's history, while they look to their future.
""What we are doing is proof that people can change, people can contribute and that as veterans no matter where you are whether you are incarcerated or outside, we have a sense of purpose,"" said Hassan Abdilliah.
Its' that sense of purpose that drives these 35 charter members. It took two years of planning to get to this moment. Army veteran and Department of Corrections employee Glen Mueller spearheaded the effort.
Mueller worked with the warden and her staff to make sure the 72 veterans housed at Moose Lake have an opportunity to continue to serve as well as act as battle buddies or helpers to others inside prions walls.
The Minnesota State director and National Executive Committee Member of the American Legion were on hand to usher in the new chapter. Prison Transition Coordinator Mae Louis was honored, and Assistant Warden Brian Collins was also recognized as a charter member.
""All of you who rose your hand and said the oath and swore to defend the constitution, wore the uniform, your service matters and it continues to matter today. I refuse to accept that people are judged by the worse day that they have had, "" said Collins.
The new chapter is already contributing to the community before becoming official.
Members stuffed eggs full of candy for the big easter egg hunt in Moose Lake. They all say they are ready for more projects and ways to serve.
""When we rejoin society — and we are going to join you in society — to know that we come through these doors as better people than we were when we came in,"" said Young.
The new American Legion members are looking forward to putting together poppies to help other Legions raise money to help veterans. They are planning a ruck march and other projects that they hope will help other organizations in their community.

Nevada lawmakers consider increasing penalties for animal cruelty - NewsBreak,"(The Center Square) - “Reba’s Law,” a bill which would increase animal cruelty punishments, has been revived after it appeared dead in the state Assembly. The legislation is named after the infamous case of Reba, the bulldog who died after being trapped in a discarded plastic bin on a hot day in Las Vegas last summer. Assembly Bill 381 never advanced after its introduction in March, but was granted a waiver to extend the deadline for the animal cruelty bill. The Assembly Judiciary Committee voted Monday to move along Reba’s Law. It is still undecided when it will be voted on by the state Senate. “To be the voice for the voiceless,” said Assemblymember Melissa Hardy, R-Clark County, at the Assembly Judiciary Committee hearing. “Those that are harmed, abused and killed, that can't speak for themselves. ... Although we can't bring her (Reba) back, this will hopefully provide accountability and save other animals that won't have to suffer as she did.” The bill would increase punishment of animal cruelty that resulted in an animal’s death to a category B felony, from a category D. First-time violators would be punishable by one to 10 years in prison, up from the current four-year maximum. Violators also face a potential fine of up to $10,000. Reba’s Law also expands the definition of animal cruelty and torture to “every act, omission or neglect, whereby unjustifiable physical pain, suffering or death is caused, allowed or permitted."" Knowing of animal cruelty or torture without an effort to stop it would also be punishable. “We agree that those convicted of animal cruelty should be held accountable as Assembly Bill 381 ensures,” wrote the American Kennel Club to the Assembly Judiciary. “Well-written animal cruelty laws ensure the protection for both animals and responsible animal owners.” The Animal Legal Defense Fund ranked Nevada in the bottom half, 31, for state animal protection laws. The Nevada Voters for Animals also agreed with the Assembly Judiciary’s vote, but expressed concern about its focus. “A law is just ink on paper unless and until it’s enforced,” wrote the organization’s President Gina Greisen. “I pray the proper resources and priority can be put behind the many heinous animal cruelty crimes occurring in Nevada.”",2025-04-17T01:30:00.000+03:00,https://www.newsbreak.com/the-center-square-509740/3965950346851-nevada-lawmakers-consider-increasing-penalties-for-animal-cruelty,Liam Hibbert | The Center Square Contributor,positive
NorthWestern Energy : Relief for Colstrip Plant supports reliable energy service for Montanans | MarketScreener,"Butte, Mont. - April 16, 2025 - Colstrip Plant owners NorthWestern Energy and Talen Energy express their gratitude to Montana's Governor Greg Gianforte, U.S. Senators Steve Daines and Tim Sheehy, U.S. Representatives Ryan Zinke and Troy Downing, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin and the federal administration for the proclamation granting two years of relief from a new Environmental Protection Agency rule. This relief is crucial for the future of Montana's power generation resource, which ensures reliable energy service in all weather conditions.
""Energy policies that consider energy reliability and energy bill impacts are in the best interest of Montana and the nation,"" said Talen Montana President Dale Lebsack. ""We are thankful for the recognition of these important factors.""
Talen Energy President and CEO Mac McFarland added, ""We greatly appreciate the engagement by the Governor, the Montana delegation, and the federal administration. Their support for Colstrip makes a significant difference and is helping to ensure reliable and reasonably priced power is available to Montana citizens.""
""This relief means our Montana customers will not be burdened with hundreds of millions of dollars of costs to comply with a new regulation that would only marginally increase the Colstrip Plant's air toxics efficiency,"" said NorthWestern Energy President and CEO Brian Bird. ""The Colstrip Plant is a vital part of our balanced generation portfolio, providing reliable power to Montana customers at reasonable costs.""
The Colstrip Plant is 99.6% efficient in reducing air toxics emissions. The new rule would improve air toxics emissions to 99.8% efficient.
Today, the Colstrip Plant meets both federal and Montana's more stringent mercury standards, as well as the revised mercury standards set by the new EPA rule.
The executive proclamation allows the Colstrip Plant's owners time to effectively evaluate options for compliance with new air toxics standards and provides the federal government time to review the new EPA rule and assess its potential consequences for reliable energy service.
""We appreciate the state and federal administrations' support in ensuring that energy reliability and affordability remain a priority"", said Bird and Lebsack. ""Working together, we can deliver an energy grid - and an energy future - that is affordable, weather-resilient, responsive, and ready for the demand arriving now.""

美國3月零售銷售勁揚 消費者趕在關稅上路前狂掃貨「1商品」,"聯合新聞網 美國3月零售銷售勁揚 消費者趕在關稅上路前狂掃貨「1商品」 閱讀全文
編譯湯淑君／綜合外電 2025年4月16日 下午3:36 美國3月零售銷售勁揚，且增幅大於預期，顯示消費者趕在進口關稅實施前大買汽車，但對經濟前景的顧慮仍打擊非必要支出。
美國商務部16日公布，3月零售銷售增加1.4%，增幅是逾兩年來最大。2月數據維持增加0.2%未修正。路透訪調經濟學家預測，上月零售銷售增幅為1.3%。剔除汽車的零售銷售增加0.5%。
美國總統川普對進口汽車和卡車加徵25%的關稅在4月初生效，對汽車零件徵收的關稅生效日期則不晚於5月3日。最新數據顯示，消費者趕在關稅上路、價格料將調漲數千美元之前買車，導致3月零售銷售躍增。

中国经济开门红 应对外部挑战有底气|中国经济_新浪财经_新浪网,"2025年一季度，中国经济实现开门红。
“国民经济实现良好开局，高质量发展向新向好。”在国新办4月16日举行的新闻发布会上，国家统计局副局长盛来运介绍，初步核算，一季度国内生产总值（GDP）318758亿元，按不变价格计算，同比增长5.4%，比上年四季度环比增长1.2%。
在全球主要经济体中名列前茅
“增长”一词在这场发布会上频频出现。工业被喻为国民经济的“压舱石”。一季度，我国工业生产增长加快，全国规模以上工业增加值同比增长6.5%，比去年全年加快0.7个百分点。
3月份，全国规模以上工业增加值同比增长7.7%。 中泰证券 研究所政策组首席分析师杨畅注意到，在去年工业生产基数较高的情况下，今年3月仍然实现了较高增速，表明我国工业生产仍然很强。
消费、投资、出口被视为拉动经济增长的“三驾马车”，其中，消费是拉动经济增长的“主引擎”。 民生银行 首席经济学家温彬认为，我国经济开年运行平稳，尽管外需有所放缓，但政策发力对内需形成提振。
一季度，消费在政策的推动下持续改善。社会消费品零售总额为124671亿元，同比增长4.6%，比上年全年加快1.1个百分点。
在投资方面，一季度，全国固定资产投资（不含农户）103174亿元，同比增长4.2%，比上年全年加快1个百分点。扣除房地产开发投资，全国固定资产投资增长8.3%。
盛来运指出，前期出台的宏观政策和今年以来扩容加码的增量政策叠加发力，有效扩大了需求、促进了生产、激发了活力、增强了信心。3月份，制造业采购经理人指数是50.5%，环比上升了0.3个百分点，连续两个月回升。
一系列政策举措为民营企业投资创造公平的营商环境，民间投资由上年全年下降转为增长。民营企业的活力动力不断显现，一季度制造业中的民间投资同比增长9.7%，基础设施投资中的民间投资增长9.3%，均比各自领域的平均增速快。
此外，盛来运表示，一季度GDP同比增长5.4%，增速高于去年全国5%的增速，也高于去年一季度5.3%的增速，还高于不少全球主要经济体一季度的经济增速，在全球主要经济体中名列前茅。在全球经济增长乏力的情况下，中国将为世界经济的稳定发挥重要作用。
高质量发展持续向新向好
一季度，中国经济在实现“量”的合理增长的同时，新质生产力也在培育壮大，高质量发展向新向好的大势没有改变。
5个维度反映出这一趋势。盛来运介绍，第一个维度是创新持续推进，新质生产力培育壮大。第二个维度是协调发展持续改善。第三个维度是高水平开放继续推进。第四个维度是绿色转型、绿色发展扎实推进。第五个维度是民生改善和安全发展继续取得新进展。
一季度，各地方加大对创新的支持力度，尤其是人工智能、量子科技等一批先进技术不断推出和应用，带动了高技术产业发展。DeepSeek、宇树人形 机器人 等一批成果的应用，既彰显了中国科技创新的实力，同时也增强了市场的信心。
新兴产业正在蓬勃发展。一季度，新能源汽车、3D打印设备、工业机器人产品产量同比分别增长45.4%、44.9%、26.0%。
盛来运指出，一季度，规模以上高技术制造业增加值同比增长9.7%，信息传输、软件和信息技术服务业增加值增长10.3%，这两个数据也显示出我国创 新动力 在增强。
工业向高端化、智能化、绿色化转型的趋势明显。从需求结构来看，当下我国投资增速实际上不高，但是高技术产业投资比重是在提升的。一季度，高技术产业投资同比增长6.5%，占全部投资的比重为10.3%，提高0.3个百分点。
民生改善和安全发展继续取得新进展。政府高度重视加大民生方面的支出，对民生方面的支出占比持续提高。能源保供有力有效，一季度就业形势总体稳定，城镇调查失业率稳中略降。一季度末，外出务工农村劳动力总量18795万人，同比增长1.1%。
此外，全国城镇调查失业率平均值为5.3%。居民收入增长与经济增长基本同步。一季度，全国居民人均可支配收入12179元，同比名义增长5.5%，扣除价格因素实际增长5.6%。
安全发展得到加强。作为防风险的重点领域，房地产行业也出现了不少积极变化。1-3月，全国新建商品房销售面积21869万平方米，同比下降3.0%，降幅比1-2月收窄2.1个百分点；新建商品房销售额20798亿元，下降2.1%，降幅收窄0.5个百分点。
“房地产止跌回稳的态势明显。”广东省城规院住房政策研究中心首席研究员李宇嘉说，一季度，房地产行业从上游开工到下游销售，相关的跌幅明显收窄。
有底气、有信心、有能力应对外部挑战
近期，美国“对等关税”风波愈演愈烈。面对冲击，我国外贸韧性依然强劲。今年一季度，我国货物贸易进出口10.3万亿元，同比增长1.3%。其中，出口6.13万亿元，增长6.9%。
“我们坚决反对美国搞关税壁垒和贸易霸凌，这种做法损人不利己，违背了经济规律和世界贸易的原则，对世界经济秩序造成严重冲击，拖累世界经济复苏。”盛来运表示，中方坚决采取一系列反制措施，不仅是维护自身发展利益的需要，也是维护世界多边贸易体系和世贸组织规则的正当之举。
谈及加征高额关税对中国的影响，盛来运说：“从短期来看，美国加征高额关税会对我国经济和外贸带来一定压力，但是改变不了中国经济持续长期向好的大势。中国经济基础稳、优势多、韧性强、潜力大，我们有底气、有信心、有能力应对外部挑战，实现既定发展目标。”
盛来运说，中国经济有基础，内需有支撑。中国是世界第二大经济体，连续15年稳居第一制造业大国的地位，产业体系完整、配套能力强，经济发展底盘稳、基础牢。同时，中国有14亿多人口，市场规模巨大，人均GDP超过1.3万美元，正处在消费升级的关键阶段，市场成长性好，无论是投资还是消费空间都非常大，将支撑中国经济持续发展。他指出，我国依靠内需和创新驱动共同推动经济增长的新格局正在形成。
目前，我国已成为150多个国家和地区的重要贸易伙伴，外贸多元化市场格局正在形成，这意味着我国对某一个国家单一出口市场的依存度在下降。盛来运举例，2018年，我国对美国的出口额占出口总额的比重是19.2%，去年已经下降到14.7%。
针对当前的外部变化，我国应对有经验，并且政策有保障。盛来运谈到，当下，一揽子政策正在发力显效，“下阶段会根据外部形势的变化及时推出增量政策，丰富的政策‘工具箱’是应对外部的冲击和挑战的保障”。
此外，中国的企业家敢闯敢拼，中国人民智慧勤劳，都是我国应对巨大风险挑战的基础和底气。“我们对中国经济后期的走势以及发展的前景充满信心。”盛来运说。

New organization aims to support businesses during Blatnik Bridge project,"New organization aims to support businesses during Blatnik Bridge project
DULUTH, Minn. (Northern News Now) - With construction starting on the new Blatnik Bridge as early as next year, there has been talk about how local businesses will be affected. Now, there’s one organization that aims to help.
It’s the Twin Ports Business Alliance.
The group connects business leaders to collaborate, support and promote businesses in the commercial districts near the Blatnik Bridge.
On Wednesday morning, they met at Hoops Brewing to talk about their mission.
A co-founder and president of the organization, Kelly Peterson, said she understands the construction will bring some change for businesses. Still, she hopes to help them during the project.
“We really want to have a positive spin on what we can do to make sure that they survive the bridge, but make sure they thrive,” Peterson said.
They want to connect businesses in the Twin Ports area to resources and marketing opportunities, as well as have regular meetings to discuss project updates.

Petro ofrece asilo a opositores ecuatorianos tras denuncias de persecución política,"Este miércoles el presidente Gustavo Petro anunció que ofrecerá asilo político a opositores ecuatorianos que estarían siendo perseguidos por el gobierno de Daniel Noboa tras las recientes elecciones presidenciales en Ecuador.
“Hay una lista negra de opositores en Ecuador que están siendo perseguidos. El Gobierno de Colombia le dará asilo a todo el que llegue a territorio colombiano. Han sido detenidos observadores electorales colombianos”, escribió Petro en su cuenta de X, citando información de Progressive International, una organización que agrupa a sectores progresistas de izquierda.

Según la información compartida por esta organización, el gobierno ecuatoriano habría elaborado una lista con aproximadamente 100 figuras de la oposición consideradas en “máximo riesgo de detención” tras las elecciones del domingo, impugnadas por la candidata Luisa González por presunto fraude, corrupción e intimidación.
La denuncia también señala que miembros de la campaña de González, incluido el candidato a la vicepresidencia Diego Borja, “ya han sufrido un severo hostigamiento por parte de las autoridades migratorias”.
Hasta el momento no existe un pronunciamiento oficial de la Cancillería colombiana ni de la embajadora de Colombia en Ecuador, María Antonia Velasco, sobre este ofrecimiento de asilo político.

中马两国人民要像走亲戚一样常来常往

中国和马来西亚是好邻居、好朋友、好伙伴，常来常往、亲如一家。“我们要划好人文交流的船桨。”习近平主席在马来西亚媒体发表的署名文章中指出，中马两国人民要像走亲戚一样常来常往，促进人文交流和文明互鉴，增进彼此特别是青年一代相知相亲。
在中马高质量共建“一带一路”进程中，民心相通是最基础、最坚实、最持久的互联互通。近年来，在中马两国领导人战略引领下，中马各领域合作成果丰硕，两国“切水不断”的世代情谊愈益深厚。两国人民的双向奔赴为中马关系增添新的活力，为推动构建高水平战略性中马命运共同体注入不竭动力。
马来西亚中华总商会永久名誉会长林国璋——
“为推动建设马中命运共同体作出华侨华人贡献，期待两国友谊在新的时代背景下继续深化、升华”
2013年10月4日，正在马来西亚进行国事访问的国家主席习近平和夫人彭丽媛在吉隆坡出席了马来西亚各界华侨华人欢迎午宴。时隔多年，这场活动的情景在时任马来西亚中华总商会总会长、现马来西亚中华总商会永久名誉会长林国璋的记忆里依然历历在目。
“午宴开始前，习近平主席和夫人彭丽媛同我们合影留念。合影照片我一直珍藏着。”林国璋回忆道，“午宴现场气氛很热烈。习近平主席的致辞赢得了一阵阵掌声，我从致辞中获得许多思考和启发。”
在致辞中，习近平主席指出：“没有华侨华人的努力，就没有中马关系今天的大好局面。”这句话让林国璋深为感动。他认为，这不仅是对马来西亚华侨华人的肯定，更是鼓舞和期许，“华侨华人肩负着促进两国友好的责任，我们要继续努力，推动马来西亚各界加深对中国的了解和认识，让马中关系更加紧密。”
林国璋说：“习近平主席在致辞中指出，中国和马来西亚是隔海相望的邻居、真心相待的朋友、互利合作的伙伴。我非常赞同。马中友好历经半个多世纪风雨洗礼，日益呈现蓬勃生机活力。两国人民之间有着深情厚谊，令马中关系切水不断，绵延不绝。”
去年，中马两国共同庆祝了建交50周年。马来西亚中华总商会见证了两国关系的很多重要时刻，是马中合作的参与者和推动者。马来西亚中华总商会多次组织代表团参加中国国际进口博览会、中国—东盟博览会等，推动马来西亚企业深度对接中国市场。林国璋认为，中国持续扩大高水平对外开放，为各国企业提供了更广阔的市场机遇。马来西亚正积极推动数字经济、电动汽车、新能源等创新领域发展，期待与中方继续深化合作，推动双边经贸关系迈向更高质量的发展阶段，助力马来西亚加快经济转型。
中马关系正迎来新的历史机遇。林国璋说：“习近平主席鼓励马来西亚华侨华人为中马共同发展多作贡献，为中马友好大业再立新功。马来西亚中华总商会和我本人将继续积极发挥作用，为推动建设马中命运共同体作出华侨华人贡献，期待两国友谊在新的时代背景下继续深化、升华，书写更多携手共进的辉煌篇章。”
天津大学马来西亚籍留学生——
“做传递友好合作浪花的使者，让更多人看见马中合作如海洋般广阔的未来”
2024年5月31日，习近平主席同马来西亚最高元首易卜拉欣互致贺电，庆祝两国建交50周年。在贺电中，习近平主席特别提到不久前收到的一封联名信，“他们立志做中马友谊的传播者和推动者，期待用所学知识服务中马命运共同体建设。两国友好事业后继有人，我对此感到欣慰。”
这封信，来自天津大学的87名马来西亚籍留学生。
谈及写信的初衷，天津大学生命科学学院生物科学专业学生石轩瑜说，越来越多马来西亚学生来到天津大学求学，并深深热爱上中国文化，激发了他强烈的使命感。“我希望成为一名优秀的文化交流推动者，为传播和推动马中友谊贡献力量。”过去一年，石轩瑜在中国的求学收获颇丰，不仅结识了来自不同专业的中国朋友，还通过课堂学习和参访交流等不断拓宽视野。“未来，我希望用实际行动为马中友谊注入更多力量，让两国合作之桥更加坚固。”
“得知习近平主席提到我们在信中表达的愿望时，我的内心既激动又感慨。那一刻，所有参与写信的留学生都感到荣幸和自豪，也深感我们的努力得到了认可。”天津大学海洋技术东盟本科生专班学生林展永动情地说。
林展永2024年通过中国政府奖学金来华留学。“我理解的马中命运共同体，是两国在各领域开展深度合作，实现共同繁荣。”在林展永看来，马中命运共同体建设不仅体现在政府层面的战略合作中，更深深植根于两国人民的深厚友谊与广泛交流中。林展永希望毕业后运用自身所学，为两国海洋合作贡献力量。“创新合作是两国关系最动人的浪花之一。我们愿做传递友好合作浪花的使者，让更多人看见马中合作如海洋般广阔的未来。”
就读于天津大学管理与经济学部信息管理与信息系统专业的陈劲咏，在中国的学习收获也很大。陈劲咏很重视社会实践，在参与学校组织的“海上数字丝绸之路”主题实践时，他提出希望构建马中企业合作数据库，为两国中小企业提供精准对接平台。这一设想来源于他在寒假回国调研时的发现，许多马来西亚中小企业希望开拓中国市场，非常期待了解更多信息。陈劲咏表示，毕业后他希望到马来西亚中资企业工作，推动中国方案和当地实际更好融合。
马来西亚国会议员李健聪——
“在各自现代化发展进程中深度对接、携手并进，将为地区和平发展作出更大贡献”
2024年11月4日至7日，马来西亚总理安瓦尔来华工作访问。习近平主席在会见安瓦尔时表示，携手推动中马命运共同体建设走深走实，助力实现各自发展目标，为地区繁荣稳定作出新的更大贡献。作为马方代表团一员，马来西亚国会议员、区域策略研究所主席李健聪参加了相关活动。他说：“两国领导人围绕马中命运共同体建设、文明交流互鉴、全球治理等话题进行了深入交流。这次访华经历让我深切感受到，马中领导人高度重视两国关系发展，马中友好有着广阔前景。”
李健聪曾多次访问中国。2020年，他曾作为马来西亚代表参加北京大学东方奖学金项目。“3个月的时间里，我和来自不同国家、不同文化背景的学员一起学习交流，通过探访企业、参观科研院所等，共同了解中国式现代化的发展经验。”李健聪表示，这段经历不仅让他看待中国的视角更加客观、真实，还深入了解了中华优秀传统文化对中国经济社会发展的推动作用。
多年来，李健聪尤其关注马中青年交流和人文对话进展。习近平主席指出，中方愿同马方深化高等教育、文化、旅游、青年、地方等交流合作，拉紧中马友好民心纽带。李健聪对此深有感触，“在共建‘一带一路’倡议引领下，马中经贸合作、基础设施互联互通等领域已取得丰硕成果。马来西亚与中国同属亚洲文明，历史渊源深厚、价值理念相通。双方加强人文领域的交流与合作，将进一步促进民心相通。”
2023年12月，中马开始实施互免签证政策。2024年，马来西亚接待中国游客约380万人次，重庆、新疆等地成为马来西亚游客的热门目的地。“当前，越来越多中国学生将马来西亚作为留学目的地，越来越多中国高校开设马来语课程。教育、旅游、文化等领域的密切交流，有利于促进民众相互了解，建立更加长远的信任。”李健聪说。
李健聪表示，马中两国领导人在多个场合强调深化伊斯兰文明和中华文明交流互鉴的重要性，倡导文明多元共生、和谐包容，践行以和平、合作、包容、融合为核心的亚洲价值观。“当今世界，多重挑战和危机交织叠加。要破解‘四大赤字’，我们应在尊重文明多样性的基础上，寻求不同文明相通之处，推动不同文明交流互鉴，消除隔阂和误解、促进民心相知相通。”李健聪说。
“马中两国都处在各自国家发展振兴的关键时期。”李健聪表示，中国式现代化和马来西亚政府提出的“昌明大马”理念都强调增进民众福祉、推动可持续发展和加强生态环境保护等。“马来西亚和中国在各自现代化发展进程中深度对接、携手并进，将为地区和平发展作出更大贡献。”

中越友好的根基在人民、未来在青年（记者手记） --国际--人民网,"中越友好的根基在人民、未来在青年（记者手记）
人民网－人民日报
4月15日上午，越南首都河内，位于红河畔的河内国际会议中心二层大厅洋溢着热情与欢乐。大厅内坐满系着红领巾的越南小学生，中国乡村振兴第一线的大学生村官，两国高校老师、青年企业家、艺术工作者等。他们都是中越人民大联欢活动代表，翘首期待两党两国领导人的会见。
“中越关系根基在人民、血脉在人民、力量在人民。”习近平总书记在致辞中强调，“让我们赓续传统友谊，将两国人民友好的涓涓溪流汇聚成中越友好的滔滔大河，为推动构建人类命运共同体、建设更加美好世界作出新的更大贡献。”
从2015年会见中越青年代表，到2023年会见中越两国青年和友好人士代表，再到此次会见中越人民大联欢活动代表，习近平总书记高度重视人民在两党两国关系发展中的作用，强调赓续两国传统友谊，开创中越命运共同体建设新征程。
中越友好在两国人民守望相助中生根发芽，在两国人民团结协作中开花结果，在两国人民共同追求中传承升华。回望历史，两国人民在争取国家独立和民族解放的正义事业中并肩战斗，给“同志加兄弟”的深厚情谊印染了鲜红底色。把握当下，两国人民团结协作，不断取得社会主义建设事业新成就。展望未来，两国人民团结奋进，将促进世界和平和人类进步。
让中越关系的民意基础更牢，是两党两国领导人共同的牵挂，也是两国各界友好人士共同努力的目标。已进入古稀之年的越中友好协会副主席阮荣光表示，两国年轻一代传承好越中友谊，将让两国友好事业后继有人。曾在中国留学的越南青年歌唱家范乔明说，越中不断推进教育交流与合作，有助于两国青年进一步加深了解，把越中友好接力棒传下去。
连民心、有温度、接地气，正成为中越人文交流的时代特征。今年2月，中国首部聚焦中越民间友好交往与跨国爱情的边贸题材电影《边海》公映，“所爱隔山海，山海皆可平”的动人故事，展现了中越民间友好往来和人文交融的历程。社交媒体上，越南歌曲《看见爱情》《夜舞》等受到中国年轻人的喜爱，成为很多短视频的配乐。歌曲旋律动人，引发情感共鸣，成为两国民心相通的注脚。今后3年，中方将邀请越南青年来华开展“红色研学之旅”。在双方共同努力下，两国人民友好的力量必将不断汇聚。
“走路才知走路难，重山之外又重山。”今天的中国和越南，已经用经济社会发展的显著成就向世界证明，两国选择的发展道路是正确的，双方加强团结合作有利于各自社会主义事业发展，能够为亚洲和世界提供更多稳定性和正能量。两国各界友好人士特别是青年一代正成为中越友好征程的领跑者，将继续为两国共同发展和构建具有战略意义的中越命运共同体贡献力量。

让中柬友好合作结出更加丰硕的成果（大使随笔） --国际--人民网,"让中柬友好合作结出更加丰硕的成果（大使随笔）
人民网－人民日报
中国和柬埔寨是传统友邻和铁杆朋友。2016年10月，习近平主席对柬埔寨进行国事访问期间，两国领导人一致决定中柬继续做高度互信的好朋友、肝胆相照的好伙伴、休戚相关的命运共同体。近9年来，在双方共同努力下，两国领导人共同擘画的构建命运共同体蓝图正日益变成现实，成为携手构建人类命运共同体的典范。
以诚相交，做肝胆相照的真朋友。中柬两国领导人像走亲戚一样常来往，结下特殊友谊。习近平主席为莫尼列太后颁授“友谊勋章”，西哈莫尼国王沿着西哈努克太皇生前足迹到访中国多个省市，体现着两国亲密无间的友好感情。新冠疫情期间，洪森亲王顶风冒雪“逆行”访华表达对中方支持，中方向柬埔寨派出本地区第一支抗疫医疗队并率先向柬方提供疫苗援助，彰显中柬守望相助、患难与共的铁杆情谊。柬埔寨首相洪玛奈就任后选择中国作为第一个进行双边访问的国家，体现出中柬友好世代传承。
以义相合，做休戚与共的同行者。柬埔寨是首个同中国签署构建命运共同体行动计划的国家，中柬命运共同体建设迈入高质量、高水平、高标准的新时代。两国始终坚持相互尊重、平等相待，在涉及彼此核心利益和重大关切问题上相互支持，积极推动三大全球倡议在柬埔寨落地走实。中柬都致力于做世界的和平力量、发展力量、进步力量，在国际和地区事务中密切配合，共同壮大全球南方力量。
互利互惠，做共同发展的好伙伴。中国连续13年成为柬最大投资来源国和贸易伙伴国。中柬务实合作亮点纷呈，柬埔寨首条高速公路金港高速建成通车，中国对外援建规模最大、等级最高的体育场柬埔寨国家体育场成为东南亚运动会主场馆，中企在海外以“建设—运营—移交”模式建设的首座国际机场暹粒吴哥国际机场通航运营。两国“钻石六边”合作架构不断充实，“工业发展走廊”和“鱼米走廊”建设持续推进，有效助力柬埔寨经济社会进步，得到当地民众广泛好评。
以文相融，做相知相亲的一家人。“中文热”在柬埔寨持续升温，中文教育正式纳入柬埔寨国民教育体系，4家孔子学院累计为柬埔寨培养数万名中文人才。中国影视剧等中国文化载体在柬埔寨深受欢迎。中柬人员往来日益密切，2024年中国游客逾84万人次到访柬埔寨，同比增长55%，越来越多的中国民众来柬亲身感受“高棉的微笑”之美。前不久，“中柬人文交流年”圆满落幕，“当少林遇见吴哥”、中柬青年对话会、首届中柬友城大会等活动进一步拉近两国人民心灵的距离。
习近平主席即将在柬埔寨传统新年之际再次对柬埔寨进行国事访问，这是给柬埔寨朋友最好的新年祝福，必将成为中柬关系发展史上新的里程碑，推动中柬命运共同体建设再上新台阶，让两国友好合作结出更加丰硕的成果，更好造福两国人民。

在为中华人民共和国主席习近平举行的欢迎宴会上的致辞 --国际--人民网,"在为中华人民共和国主席习近平举行的欢迎宴会上的致辞
（2025年4月16日，布特拉加亚）
人民网－人民日报
中华人民共和国主席习近平阁下，
各位阁下，
各位贵宾，
女士们、先生们：
我非常荣幸欢迎中华人民共和国主席习近平阁下再次访问马来西亚。此访再次表明，两国关系以相互尊重为基础，历经历史沉淀，在共同目标指引下不断推进。
长期以来，无论顺境逆境，马中两国始终并肩同行，不仅是全面战略伙伴，更是坚定的朋友。两国关系在相互理解中铸就，以共同信念为支撑。我们坚信，两国同行才能行稳致远，合作既有利于双方，也有利于地区和平繁荣。
习近平主席上次访马已逾10年。这期间，世界发生了很多变化，但马中友谊坚定不渝，通过对话增添活力，通过行动得到确认。
中国连续多年是马来西亚最重要贸易伙伴，从商品流通到理念沟通，再到能源、基础设施和创新转型，在马来西亚一系列重要发展领域都有中国身影。
马中关系真正的力量，不仅体现在贸易数据和游客往来上，更基于我们的高度共识：只有共同繁荣，才能实现持久繁荣；信任一旦生根，必须悉心呵护、耐心培育、坚定维护。
在习近平主席领导下，中国提出一系列全球性倡议，体现了看待世界的独特方式。“一带一路”倡议为互联互通提供了新的可能，不仅打造了交通网络，更提供了合作框架。全球发展倡议强调包容性进步，全球安全倡议呼吁通过对话实现和平，全球文明倡议提出尊重差异不是和谐的障碍，而是其前提。
支撑这些理念的，是习近平主席提出的构建人类命运共同体的宏大愿景，这让我想起《论语》中的名言：四海之内皆兄弟。
马来西亚与中国遵照先哲的理念，开展“儒伊文明对话”等活动，增进相互理解，不断扩大共识，共同追求和谐繁荣等价值理念。
当前，多边主义面临巨大挑战，有些国家抛弃共同责任原则，还有些国家质疑长期奉行的准则。中国的全球性倡议为世界带来新的希望，这些倡议为了大家而不是一家，倡导革新而不是对立。
我们今天正在目睹的，不是客观评估全球化的不足之处，而是倒退回“经济部落主义”。市场准入成为武器，在任意破坏和单边执念重压下，追求共同增长的多边契约正在动摇。
值此困难时刻，世界渴望稳定性、可靠性、方向感。在中国的作为中，我们看到这些品质并深感钦佩，认识到中国带来的不仅是稳定性，更是未来持久的希望。
习近平主席两次访马期间，都引用了马来谚语“切水不断”。中国是拥有五千年历史的文明古国，中华民族历经岁月洗礼而屹立不倒，历经千锤百炼而愈发成熟。真正体现中国力量的，不只是各方面成就，更是从容应对干扰、坚定应对不确定性的韧性。
中国有句俗语说得好：“世上无难事，只怕有心人。”面对动荡的世界，中国始终是理性、坚强、可靠的伙伴，马来西亚珍视中国的确定性，将遵循历史智慧和未来希望的指引，始终做中国坚定不移、坚守原则的朋友。马来西亚清楚知道国家利益所在，将据此制定外交政策。相比对抗，马来西亚不只是偏好合作，而是积极拥抱合作；相比对立，马来西亚不只是选择相互尊重，而是捍卫相互尊重。马来西亚选择对话，不是权宜之计，更是希望为持久和平繁荣奠定基础。
习近平主席不仅是杰出的政治领袖，而且深谙经济发展之道，更是有着清晰愿景、了解文明价值的伟人。
最后我想说，历史不是仓促写就的，建立真正的伙伴关系也不是朝夕之功，需要日积月累、精心呵护、胸怀勇气、锐意前行。愿马中友谊长存，如大海一样深邃，如星辰一样恒久，永远朝气蓬勃、充满希望。
谢谢大家!

Oil rises $1 on new US sanctions,"Oil prices rose more than $1 a barrel on Wednesday on concerns about global supplies after Washington issued new sanctions targeting Chinese importers of Iranian oil.
Brent crude futures rose $1.06, or 1.64%, to $65.73 a barrel by 1618 GMT while US WTI crude rose $1.02, or 1.66%, to $62.35.
The US on Wednesday issued new sanctions targeting Iran's oil exports, including against a China-based ""teapot refinery"", as Trump seeks to ramp up pressure on Tehran, and drive Iranian oil exports down to zero.
The action comes as the US government has relaunched negotiations with Iran over its nuclear programme this month. Meanwhile, Iran's right to enrich uranium is not negotiable, Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi said on Wednesday ahead of the next round of talks in Rome on Saturday. OPEC has received updated plans for Iraq, Kazakhstan and other countries to make further oil output cuts to compensate for pumping above agreed quotas, the group said on Wednesday.

Woodside Signs LNG Supply Agreements With Uniper,"Woodside Signs LNG Supply Agreements With Uniper
Woodside Signs LNG Supply Agreements With Uniper
HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Woodside has signed LNG sale and purchase agreements with Uniper for the supply of 1.0 million tonnes per annum (Mtpa) from Louisiana LNG LLC and up to 1.0 Mtpa from its global portfolio (Woodside Energy Trading Singapore Pty. Ltd.), demonstrating ongoing strong demand for LNG globally.
Woodside CEO Meg O’Neill said these agreements represent another important milestone to move Louisiana LNG towards a final investment decision.
“We are delighted to advance our longstanding relationship with Uniper through these milestone supply agreements. Uniper’s commitment speaks volumes about Woodside’s track record as a trusted LNG provider, built on decades of delivering reliable and flexible supply solutions for our global partners.
“Louisiana LNG is Woodside’s largest growth project. It leverages the robust US gas resource, an outstanding site, best-in-class EPC and technology partners and Woodside’s track record of successful project delivery. The addition of Atlantic Basin LNG supply to our established position in the Pacific strengthens Woodside’s portfolio and allows us to tailor contract structures based on various price indices and tenures to better meet our customers’ diverse needs.
“As we continue to progress sell-down opportunities for Louisiana LNG, these agreements reinforce the project’s unique advantages and its economic competitiveness.
“Uniper’s leadership in European energy markets make them an ideal counterparty, and this builds on Woodside’s existing offtake arrangements, underscoring our shared commitment to delivering value for all companies and the economies in which each operate.
“In an environment of increasing demand for dependable sources of LNG, particularly in Europe, we remain focused on delivering reliable energy supply that will benefit our partners and stakeholders for years to come,” she said.
Michael Lewis, Uniper CEO said, “We are very pleased to secure additional LNG supplies for our customers in Europe from a reliable LNG supplier like Woodside. This deal will support our security of supply and flexible generation strategy together with the potential development of additional gas-fired power plants in Germany to complement the renewable build-up. Woodside is one of our biggest LNG suppliers globally with a solid track record of deliveries of LNG to us from their existing projects.
“With this new project in Louisiana, we are further extending the cooperation with Woodside. Long-term LNG contracts like this contribute directly to the competitiveness of European industry. Reliable and cost-effective energy supply is a cornerstone of a strong industrial base, and deals like this help ensure our customers can count on both.”
Louisiana LNG LLC will supply 1.0 Mtpa of LNG on a free-on-board basis for up to thirteen years from the commercial operations date (COD) of Louisiana LNG.
In addition, Woodside Energy Trading Singapore Pty. Ltd. will supply up to 1.0 Mtpa of LNG on a delivered ex-ship basis from Woodside’s global portfolio into Europe commencing with Louisiana LNG’s COD over a term until 2039.
The sale and purchase agreements are subject to Woodside’s final investment decision on the three train 16.5 Mtpa foundation development of Louisiana LNG.

"時政新聞眼丨習近平再訪馬來西亞，中馬關係如何開啟新的""黃金50年""？-國際在線","4月16日，習近平主席對馬來西亞的國事訪問活動密集展開。
　　時隔12年再次訪馬，如何續寫“綿延千年”的傳統友誼？如何開啟中馬關係新的“黃金50年”？讓我們透過時間，讀懂習主席這次歷史性訪問。

△視頻：習近平出席馬來西亞最高元首舉行的歡迎儀式
01 　　 歷史性訪問
　　2013年，習近平就任國家主席後首次出訪東南亞，其中一站就是馬來西亞。
　　時隔12年，習主席此次馬來西亞之行對推動中馬關係提質升級具有重要的里程碑意義。
△馬來西亞布特拉加亞街頭豎起巨幅海報，歡迎習主席到訪。（總臺央視記者劉岳拍攝）
　　馬來西亞高度重視習主席此訪，給予高規格接待。
　　15日，馬來西亞總理安瓦爾率高級官員到機場迎接。當晚，安瓦爾在社交平臺發文，表達對習主席到訪的歡迎和期待：“此次訪問必將使兩國受益，並將繼續加強基於相互尊重的友好關係。”
△安瓦爾總理率高級官員到機場迎接習主席到訪。（總臺央視記者韓銳拍攝）
　　16日，馬來西亞最高元首易卜拉欣在國家王宮廣場為習主席舉行隆重歡迎儀式，隨後兩國元首舉行會見。安瓦爾總理全程陪同。
△歡迎儀式開始前，儀仗隊列隊準備。（總臺央視記者楊波、馬超拍攝）
　　當天下午，習主席同安瓦爾總理舉行會談。在一系列國事活動中，中馬傳統友誼被反復提起。
　　回望傳統友誼，更能感悟“為鄰之道”。
　　在同安瓦爾總理會談時，習主席指出，兩國友好在悠久歷史中孕育，在文化交融中生長，在互惠互利中鞏固，在風雨同舟中昇華，展現了以心相交、以誠相待、以義為持、以和為貴的共同價值追求，體現出兩國人民的歷史智慧和勇氣，是兩國共同的寶貴財富。
△歡迎宴會廳外身著民族服裝的少年兒童。（總臺央視記者閆耀東拍攝）
　　重溫戰略抉擇，方能攜手“大道之行”。
　　馬來西亞同中國建交時，正逢冷戰時期。消除遏制、打破堅冰，需要戰略勇氣和遠見。此訪之際，習主席在馬來西亞媒體發表的署名文章中回憶，“51年前，中馬兩國領導人衝破冷戰陰霾決定建交，開創了中國同東盟國家關係的先河。”
　　歷史啟迪未來。在同安瓦爾總理會談時，習主席指出，“雙方要在下一個50年繼續把握歷史主動，勇立時代潮頭”。
△布特拉加亞街頭，中馬兩國國旗迎風飄揚。（總臺央視記者劉岳拍攝）
02 　　 開啟中馬關係新的“黃金50年”
　　去年，中馬兩國隆重慶祝建交50週年。今天，中馬關係如何開啟新的“黃金50年”，備受矚目。
　　2013年習主席訪馬期間，兩國關係提升為全面戰略夥伴關係。2023年，習主席同訪華的安瓦爾總理宣佈共建中馬命運共同體，開啟了雙邊關係新的歷史篇章。
　　今年此訪，中馬兩國領導人就雙邊關係提質升級達成新的重要共識——共同打造高水準戰略性中馬命運共同體。

△視頻：習近平同馬來西亞總理安瓦爾舉行會談
　　如何理解中馬命運共同體的“高水準戰略性”？
　　先來看“戰略性”。
　　習主席在同安瓦爾總理會談時，就建設高水準戰略性中馬命運共同體提出三點意見，首先強調的是“堅持戰略自主，開展高水準戰略協作”。
　　他指出，中馬兩國都堅持自立自強，反對外部干涉，要繼續攜手走好符合本國國情的發展道路，“把前途命運牢牢掌握在自己手中”。
　　戰略性還體現在政治互信。安瓦爾總理在會談時説，馬方願同中方深化戰略溝通，鞏固政治互信。易卜拉欣最高元首表示，無論國際形勢如何變化，都將攜手共進、合作共贏，推動高水準戰略性命運共同體建設。
△會談現場擺放的中馬兩國國旗。（總臺央視記者郭鴻拍攝）
　　再來看“高水準”。
　　2024年，中馬雙邊貿易額達2120億美元，比兩國建交時增長近千倍。進一步深化務實合作，是建設中馬命運共同體的題中之義。
　　習主席在會談時提出的第二點意見，是“凝聚發展合力，打造高品質發展合作標杆”。會談現場，習主席就兩國下階段務實合作明方向、劃重點。
　　當天，兩國領導人共同見證中馬雙方交換30多份雙邊合作文本。安瓦爾總理表示，習主席此訪取得的創紀錄合作成果，對馬方意義重大，馬方深受鼓舞。
△從總理官邸會談廳遠眺總理府。（總臺央視記者許永松拍攝）
　　“高水準戰略性”的另一個維度，是心靈契合、以心相交。
　　在同安瓦爾總理會談時，習主席提出的第三點意見，是“傳承世代友好，深化文明交流互鑒”。
　　去年，在互免簽證政策帶動下，兩國人員往來近600萬人次。在此訪中，習主席指出，以簽署互免簽證協定為契機，大力開展旅遊、青年、地方交流，深化文化、教育、體育、電影、傳媒等合作。“中馬兩國人民要像走親戚一樣常來常往，促進人文交流和文明互鑒，增進彼此特別是青年一代相知相親。”
△總理官邸外等候迎接習主席的馬來西亞青少年。（總臺央視記者韓銳拍攝）
03 　　 “守護好亞洲家園的美好發展前景”
　　習近平主席這次馬來西亞之行，既推動中馬命運共同體建設邁上新臺階，對推動中國同東盟關係整體發展也具有重大意義。
　　馬來西亞是開啟東盟同中國合作的先行者、引領者。今年，馬來西亞同時擔任東盟輪值主席國和中國東盟關係協調國。
　　此訪期間，習主席多次表示，中國全力支持馬來西亞履職2025年東盟輪值主席國，期待馬來西亞作為中國東盟關係協調國更好發揮橋梁作用。
△馬來西亞總理府。（總臺央視記者關舟拍攝）
　　面對當前來勢洶洶的單邊主義、保護主義、霸淩行徑，中馬兩國領導人的表態擲地有聲。
　　習主席表示，中方願同地區國家一道，儘早簽署中國－東盟自由貿易區升級議定書，以開放包容、團結合作抵制“脫鉤斷鏈”、“小院高墻”和濫徵關稅，以和平、合作、開放、包容的亞洲價值觀回應弱肉強食的叢林法則，以亞洲的穩定性和確定性應對世界的不穩定和不確定。
　　安瓦爾總理回應，面對單邊主義抬頭，馬方願同中方加強合作，共同應對風險挑戰。東盟不會贊同任何單方面施加關稅的做法，將通過合作聯合自強，保持經濟增長。
△馬來西亞國家王宮。（總臺央視記者曹亞星拍攝）
　　習主席這次東南亞之行，是中央周邊工作會議之後首次出訪。中國以全球視野審視周邊，堅定選擇攜手周邊國家共創美好未來。
　　16日晚上，在安瓦爾總理舉行的歡迎宴會上，習主席發表致辭。他鮮明指出：“面對當前國際秩序和經濟全球化遭受衝擊，兩國將同地區國家團結一致，共同抵禦地緣政治和陣營對抗暗流，衝破單邊主義和保護主義逆流，守護好亞洲家園的美好發展前景。”

Xi: China will stand with Asian peers to stop 'abuse of tariffs' | NHK WORLD-JAPAN News,"Chinese President Xi Jinping, touring Southeast Asian countries, has expressed readiness to stand with his Asian peers to prevent what he called the abuse of tariffs.
He made the remark during his meeting with Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim on Wednesday.
He effectively called for solidarity among members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations in the face of US President Donald Trump's tariff policies.
Chinese state-run media reported that Xi said China supports Malaysia in its role as the ASEAN chair.
He expressed resolve to stand with Southeast Asian nations to stop tariffs being misused and respond to global uncertainties with Asian stability.
The Trump administration hiked levies on Chinese imports to 145 percent. Trump has paused what he calls ""reciprocal"" tariffs on other countries, but has indicated he will impose high tariffs on Southeast Asian nations. Exporters in the region are expressing concern.
China's trade with ASEAN is larger than its trade with the US. The country is apparently seeking to boost its influence in the region and strengthen cooperation with ASEAN members to reduce the impact of US tariffs on its export industry.
Xi arrived in Malaysia on Wednesday after wrapping up a visit to Vietnam. He is scheduled to visit Cambodia for two days from Thursday.",2025-04-17T01:51:30.277+03:00,https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/news/20250417_02,NHK WORLD,positive

Navigation through Suez Canal sees improvement in March: Canal Chief,"Navigation through Suez Canal sees improvement in March: Canal Chief
Cairo, April 17 (IANS) Suez Canal Authority (SCA) Chairman Osama Rabie has said that there is a slight improvement in navigation through the canal during March.
The number of ships passing through the canal in March increased by 2.4 per cent compared to January, Rabie announced on Wednesday during a ceremony in Ismailia Governorate in northeast Egypt, celebrating the achievements made by the canal over the past few years, Xinhua news agency reported.
He added that the waterway recorded an 8.8 per cent increase in revenues compared to January.
The SCA chief also noted that 264 ships adjusted their routes to pass through the Suez Canal instead of the Cape of Good Hope since the beginning of February.
""The US is currently attacking the Houthis in Yemen, and it remains unclear whether these US attacks have weakened the Houthis' ability to target shipping in the Red Sea,"" Rabie told Xinhua news agency.
Egypt, which relies heavily on revenue from the Suez Canal, has repeatedly called for calm following a series of attacks on commercial vessels in the Red Sea.
In March, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi said that due to the regional turmoil -- including attacks on vessels in the Red Sea by Yemen's Houthis -- the Suez Canal was losing nearly $800 million in revenue each month.
The US military has resumed airstrikes on Houthi-held areas in northern Yemen since March 15 in a bid to deter the group from attacking Israeli targets, the US Navy, and international shipping lanes in the region.
However, the Houthi group responded by affirming its unwavering support for Gaza.
It has resumed attacks on Israeli targets and US military vessels in the Red Sea, as Israel ended a January ceasefire with Hamas and restarted military operations in Gaza.
The project would need governmental approvals and would be funded through the SCA's investment budget, to avoid ""placing any additional burdens on the state's general budget,"" a statement added.
Rabie said it could raise the competitiveness of the canal and allow it to take more and bigger ships.

"""Queremos que as empresas estejam conosco para que as desigualdades deixem de existir"", afirma Cida Gonçalves a lideranças do governo federal - Ministério das Mulheres","O diálogo e a articulação para avançar nas ações que garantem a dignidade e a equidade para as mulheres no mundo do trabalho conduziram o encontro entre ministras, ministros, secretárias-executivas e secretárias nacionais do governo federal nesta quarta-feira (16), em um almoço no restaurante da Tia Zélia, em Brasília. Organizado pelos ministérios das Mulheres e do Trabalho e Emprego, o encontro destacou a importância da igualdade de gênero no mundo do trabalho trazendo dados do 3° Relatório de Transparência Salarial e de Critérios Remuneratórios e os avanços com a implementação da Lei de Igualdade Salarial no país.
Veja aqui os principais dados do 3º Relatório de Transparência Salarial.
De acordo com a ministra das Mulheres, Cida Gonçalves, “estamos estabelecendo outro patamar de relação entre homens e mulheres no mundo do trabalho. E vamos trabalhar sob a perspectiva da Política de Cuidados para que possamos diminuir o tempo das mulheres em afazeres domésticos para que elas possam se cuidar e se proteger. Esse é o desafio que me foi colocado pelo presidente Lula: diminuir a violência contra as mulheres no país e garantir a igualdade salarial entre homens e mulheres. Queremos que as empresas estejam conosco para que possamos garantir essas mudanças necessárias e as desigualdades deixem de existir”, convocou a ministra.
Cida Gonçalves destacou que as mulheres ainda enfrentam um cenário de desigualdades no trabalho, mas que o 3º Relatório de Transparência Salarial também indicou avanços. Um dos dados positivos destacados pela ministra foi o crescimento do número de empresas em que a diferença salarial entre mulheres e homens é de até 5%. “É verdade que nós não queremos nenhuma desigualdade, mas entre uma diferença de 20,9% e 5%, nós precisamos comemorar os bons exemplos e avançar nas negociações com as empresas para que ampliemos ainda mais esse número ”, pontuou. Outra boa notícia é que aumentou a participação das mulheres negras no mercado de trabalho, que cresceu de 3.254.272 para 3.848.760.
O ministro do Trabalho e Emprego, Luiz Marinho, enfatizou que “com determinação vamos continuar avançando. A ministra Cida destaca muito bem o início desse trabalho, estamos nos primeiros passos da lei e já vemos resultados. Queremos mais”.
A ministra da Cultura, Margareth Menezes, declarou que todos os movimentos que fortalecem a participação de mulheres são muito importantes e a ministra da Gestão e da Inovação em Serviços Públicos, Esther Dweck, declarou unidade entre as pastas para que a política de igualdade salarial seja cada vez mais ampla.
“Essa semana demos curso de formação para novos servidores na área de Tecnologia da Informação e infelizmente é uma área que tem menos de 10% de mulheres. A ministra Cida tem toda razão, temos que abrir espaços e trazer mulheres para estas áreas melhor remuneradas e interferir no mercado de trabalho porque são onde os salários maiores estão”, pontuou a ministra.
A história de Tia Zélia também foi um ponto destacado entre os discursos, como uma mulher que construiu sua trajetória ligada ao trabalho, como cozinheira, e como grande defensora da democracia.
Estiveram presentes também os ministros Márcio Macêdo (Secretaria-Geral da Presidência da República), Luciana Santos (Ciência, Tecnologia e Inovação) e Sônia Faustino Mendes (interina das Comunicações).
As mulheres avançam, o Brasil avança
O compromisso da equidade de gênero não é apenas um imperativo ético, mas também um fator estratégico e civilizatório para o desenvolvimento econômico social do país.
Mais de 20% de crescimento no PIB mundial é o avanço que o país terá com a igualdade de oportunidades entre eles e elas, segundo estimativas do Bando Mundial. Já o PIB brasileiro poderá expandir R$ 382 bilhões com a implementação de políticas moderadas de igualdade de gênero. O valor seria duplicado com a igualdade plena.
Movimento pela Igualdade no Trabalho
Apesar de apresentarem, em média, maior escolaridade que os homens, as mulheres ainda recebem 20,7% a menos. Quando se observa o recorte étnico-racial, a desigualdade é ainda mais acentuada: mulheres negras ganham 53% a menos do que homens brancos. Diante desse cenário, os ministérios das Mulheres e do Trabalho e Emprego lançaram o Movimento pela Igualdade no Trabalho. A iniciativa conta com a adesão de empresas e organizações trabalhistas de diversos setores, como o bancário e o industrial, e reforça o compromisso coletivo com a promoção da equidade no mundo do trabalho. Acesse a página do Movimento pela Igualdade no Trabalho e faça a adesão de sua empresa ou entidade.
Outras ações conjuntas pela Igualdade no Trabalho
Plano Nacional de Igualdade Salarial e Laboral - Anunciado em 2024, o Plano reúne mais de 80 ações divididas em três grandes eixos para enfrentar as desigualdades no trabalho e alavancar a economia do país. São eles: 1) Ampliação do acesso das mulheres ao mundo do trabalho; 2) Permanência das mulheres em atividades laborais; e 3) Valorização e ascensão profissional das mulheres. Saiba mais aqui.
Guia para Negociação Coletiva da Lei de Igualdade Salarial - Lei n° 14.611/2023 - A publicação dos ministérios das Mulheres e do Trabalho e Emprego tem por objetivo indicar sugestões e recomendações que possam contribuir com os processos de negociação coletiva sobre a implementação da lei . Baixe aqui o guia.
Política Nacional de Cuidados - Sancionada em 2024, a Lei 15.069 visa garantir o cuidado para quem precisa, reduzindo a sobrecarga das tarefas domésticas e de cuidado - de filhos, idosos ou outros dependentes - que recaem principalmente sobre as mulheres, impactando seu desenvolvimento profissional.
Programa Pró-Equidade de Gênero e Raça - Até aqui, mais de 100 empresas já assumiram o compromisso com a igualdade no trabalho ao se inscreverem no programa, que já está em sua sétima edição.

Marcelo Arar é nomeado subsecretário de Esportes do Rio - Diário do Rio de Janeiro,"O ex-vereador de quatro mandatos Marcelo Arar, conhecido por sua atuação em projetos esportivos durante seus quatro mandatos na Câmara Municipal, assumiu na última semana a Subsecretaria de Lutas, Atividades Físicas e Bem-Estar, vinculada à Secretaria Municipal de Esportes do Rio de Janeiro. A nomeação foi feita pelo secretário Guilherme Schleder, com o aval do prefeito Eduardo Paes.
Em entrevista, Arar adiantou as prioridades de sua gestão. “Essa subsecretaria é voltada para o mundo das lutas, para as atividades físicas e para o bem-estar da população de um modo geral”, afirmou.
Entre os projetos destacados está a continuidade do ensino de artes marciais para os estudantes das escolas municipais e a revitalização da Calçada da Fama, equipamento criado por ele durante seu mandato como vereador. “Além de preservar a história e a cultura da luta, pode se tornar um grande ponto turístico”, disse.
Na área de atividades físicas, o foco será o fortalecimento das academias públicas de musculação e a promoção de exercícios ao ar livre, aproveitando programas já existentes na cidade.
A subsecretaria também pretende atuar na capacitação profissional no setor esportivo e incluir a ioga como ferramenta de saúde mental. “Vamos aumentar o conhecimento de todos aqueles ligados ao esporte e preparar milhares de cariocas para o mercado de trabalho, gerando bem-estar social”, declarou Arar.
O ex-vereador expressou entusiasmo com o novo desafio. “Depois de quatro mandatos como vereador, estou empolgado com essa oportunidade de estar do outro lado do balcão, no poder executivo. Vontade de fazer pelo carioca não me falta”, concluiu, em tom descontraído.
Ainda de acordo com Arar, a pasta sob seu comando terá como meta aliar esporte, qualidade de vida e inclusão social, dando continuidade a projetos que ele defendia em sua atuação parlamentar.",2025-04-17T01:33:00.000+03:00,https://diariodorio.com/marcelo-arar-e-nomeado-subsecretario-de-esportes-do-rio,@FelipeLucen4,positive
Why Supporting Small Batch Craft Weed Brands Matters This 4/20 | stupidDOPE,"As 4/20 approaches, the cannabis world is gearing up for its biggest day of the year—sales, activations, and a flood of brand promotions across every platform. But behind all the flashy marketing campaigns and loud dispensary rollouts, there’s a more important conversation brewing: who are you really supporting when you buy weed this 4/20?
In an industry that’s still figuring itself out, small batch craft cannabis brands are fighting for survival—and your support could make all the difference. These are the people who grow, trim, and package with care. The ones who aren’t backed by billion-dollar hedge funds or global conglomerates. They’re Black-owned, woman-owned, veteran-owned, family-run, and community-driven. And unlike the big guys, they actually give a damn.
The Corporate Machine Has Entered the Chat
Let’s be honest: the major players—Multi-State Operators (MSOs), Regional Operators (ROs), and their faceless house brands—are everywhere. They’re muscling into every market with slick packaging and low prices that often come at the cost of quality, ethics, and employee well-being.
These companies churn out weed like it’s fast fashion. Grown at scale, packaged in bulk, and sold as a commodity with no real story behind it. It’s weed made for margins, not for people. And in most cases, it smokes like it—dry, dull, and uninspired. If you’ve ever lit up something that looked good but hit like cardboard? That’s the corporate cannabis experience.
On the other side of that equation are small batch craft brands. These are producers who treat cannabis as an art form and a livelihood—not just a product to be scaled. They’re making careful decisions about genetics, cultivation practices, curing processes, and flavor profiles. And they’re doing it all while navigating impossible regulations, inconsistent supply chains, and razor-thin margins.
Why Small Batch Matters
Supporting small batch cannabis isn’t just about charity—it’s about better weed. These brands aren’t chasing mass production. They’re obsessed with quality, effect, and consumer experience. Their batches are smaller because their standards are higher.
When you buy from small producers, you’re also often getting:
-
Properly flushed and cured flower that burns clean
-
Unique genetics that aren’t part of a soulless house brand portfolio
-
Real terpene profiles that weren’t stripped out for the sake of volume
-
People behind the product who live in and support your community
This is the kind of weed that’s crafted—not manufactured. And you feel the difference every time you spark up.
Ownership Still Matters in Cannabis
Despite all the legalization wins over the last few years, cannabis is still overwhelmingly owned and controlled by people who weren’t harmed by prohibition. That needs to change.
Every time you choose a craft brand that’s Black-owned, veteran-owned, woman-owned, immigrant-owned, or family-run, you’re helping to shift the power dynamic in this industry. These operators usually don’t have the same access to capital, media, or shelf space—but they’re out here doing the hard work. They show up. They hire from within the community. They reinvest in their people.
Ownership matters. Especially when the industry is being flooded with the same corporate actors who once lobbied to keep it illegal.
4/20 Is the Perfect Time to Rethink Your Support
If you’re someone who really cares about cannabis—where it comes from, who grows it, how it’s treated—then 4/20 should be about more than catching a deal or grabbing a novelty item. It should be a moment of intention.
Ask yourself:
-
Who’s getting your money?
-
Are they producing something meaningful?
-
Are they part of the solution or part of the problem?
If you want to support small batch, there are plenty of ways to do it this 4/20:
-
Look up the story behind the brand before buying
-
Follow independent growers and producers on social media
-
Attend community events and meet-the-maker sessions
-
Ask your local shop to carry more craft brands
-
Talk to your budtender about who’s actually making the products
-
Share the love. Word of mouth still matters
And maybe most importantly—tip your budtender. They’re often the only connection between consumers and the people who actually make the product. A good budtender can steer someone toward a small batch brand just by sharing their knowledge. Appreciate that.
Stop Chasing Gimmicks. Start Backing Real Ones.
The cannabis industry is full of trends. Drinks are booming. Edibles are evolving. Vapes are everywhere. But through it all, the heart of this culture has always been the grower, the maker, the person who gives a damn about the plant.
This 4/20, skip the flashy promo drops and the house brand “discounts.” Look for the brands that are doing it for real—because they love the plant, not just the profit. The ones that are part of your community. The ones making small batches with big vision.
That’s how you keep cannabis from turning into just another soulless industry. That’s how you make your high mean something.
This 4/20, support people—not corporations.",2025-04-17T01:45:00.000+03:00,https://stupiddope.com/2025/04/why-supporting-small-batch-craft-weed-brands-matters-this-4-20,Christo Marron,positive

Peso mexicano se aprecia por debilitamiento del dólar; cierra en 19.96 unidades
Antes del periodo feriado por Semana Santa, en el que se reduce la actividad en los mercados, la divisa local fue beneficiada por un debilitamiento del billete verde y por un crecimiento económico de China mayor al esperado.
El peso mexicano se apreció frente al dólar en las operaciones de este miércoles. Antes del periodo feriado por Semana Santa, en el que se reduce la actividad en los mercados, la divisa local fue beneficiada por un debilitamiento del billete verde y por cifras económicas.
El tipo de cambio terminó la jornada en el nivel de 19.9622 unidades por dólar. Contra un cierre de 20.1235 unidades ayer, con los datos oficiales del Banco de México (Banxico), su movimiento significó para el peso una mejora de 16.13 centavos o 0.80 por ciento.
El precio del dólar se movió en un rango entre un máximo de 20.1361 unidades y un nivel mínimo de 19.9555. El Índice Dólar (DXY), del Intercontinental Exchange, que mide al dólar con una canasta de seis monedas referencia, cedía al cierre 0.82% a 99.34 puntos.
“El dólar estadounidense extendió sus pérdidas durante la jornada, mientras la incertidumbre continuó pesando. La divisa rondó mínimos de varios años y se mantuvo bajo presión a pesar de cifras de ventas minoristas"", dijo Quásar Elizundia, estratega de Pepperstone.
Impulso desde China y dólar débil
La economía de China mostró un desempeño más sólido de lo esperado al crecer 5.4% en el primer trimestre, superando la expectativa de 5.1% del consenso. El resultado mostró impulso sostenido desde finales de 2024, debido a importantes estímulos gubernamentales.
Los datos económicos de China apoyaron a las divisas emergentes como el peso, que también aprovecharon el debilitamiento del dólar en un contexto de incertidumbre por los efectos de los aranceles impuestos por el presidente de Estados Unidos, Donald Trump, a China.
La caída del dólar y el impulso generado por las cifras del crecimiento económico de China fueron suficientes para opacar los datos positivos publicados en Estados Unidos, donde las ventas minoristas aumentaron 1.4% en marzo contra 1.3% previsto por los analistas.
""Aumentando la vulnerabilidad del dólar, Trump lanzó una nueva investigación sobre posibles aranceles a minerales críticos y mantuvo las amenazas a sectores como los del farmacéutico, cobre y semiconductores"", añadió Elizundia en su nota a clientes de Pepperstone.
Discurso de Powell
Los participantes digerían también un discurso del presidente de la Reserva Federal (Fed), Jerome Powell, quien afirmó que el organismo estaba bien posicionado para esperar por una mayor claridad de efectos de los aranceles antes de ajustar la postura monetaria.
Powell también reconoció que el crecimiento de la mayor economía del mundo parece estar desacelerándose, con un gasto de consumo creciendo modestamente, y una avalancha de importaciones para evitar aranceles que probablemente pesen en las estimaciones.",2025-04-17T00:05:00.000+03:00,https://www.eleconomista.com.mx/mercados/precio-dolar-hoy-16-abril-2025-cuanto-cerro-20250416-755331.html,@eleconomista,positive
消博会上，浙企发掘多元市场,"2025-04-17 06:42:53 来源：浙江在线-浙江日报 记者 胡静漪
　　 极客桥的工作人员演示照明无人机。 记者 张迪 摄
　　 浙江在线4月17日讯（记者 胡静漪） “出口转内销”成为大热的话题。
　　在美国宣布“对等关税”措施后不到两周，4月13日至18日，第五届消博会如期在海南海口举办。在这个开放大平台上，商务部启动了“外贸优品中华行”系列活动，将走进包括浙江在内的10个外贸和消费大省，围绕重点行业帮助外贸企业与流通领域企业对接，畅通外贸企业的内销渠道。
　　记者注意到，本届消博会的一大特色，就是配套设置了外贸优品特色展区。“外转内”风起，置身外贸大省的浙江企业如何应变？
　　 内销市场怎么转
　　4月14日上午，外贸优品特色展区里搭起舞台，首场“外贸优品中华行”产销对接会在此举行。记者发现，这个展区里也有浙江企业的身影。
　　浙江凯喜雅集团品牌负责人王鹏铖早早来到现场，希望在国内销售渠道方面有所收获。作为中国最大的丝绸产品出口商，凯喜雅90%的营收来自外贸，产品主要销往欧洲、美国、日本等高端市场。
　　谈到关税，王鹏铖非常淡定：“我们经历过多次全球经济风波，在2015年就做了战略调整，没有那么慌张。”
　　凯喜雅很清楚自己“转内”的弱项。比如，出口大多是B端生意，对接代理商、经销商，对于自主品牌建设没有太多经验；国内市场的运行逻辑还没有摸透，认知和理念转变还需要时间。这也是大多数外贸企业面临的现实问题。
　　“往价值链上层走”，是内外贸通行的底层逻辑。对接会上，王鹏铖重点推介了“可机洗真丝”，这项专利技术一举突破丝绸难打理的痛点，让产品的应用场景和适用人群更广。“C端偏弱，就先做产品。”他说，“全产业链创新是我们的强项，‘外转内’就是要扬长避短，夯实产品竞争力的基础。”
　　中国不缺消费力，但市场瞬息万变。眼下，凯喜雅正在开发全品类产品，价格从几十元到几十万元不等，以满足更多消费人群的需求；同时，广泛参加国内展会，拥抱直播、电商等线上平台，近距离触及国内消费者。
　　电商如同“外转内”的快捷键，在消博会上被很多企业提及。
　　在浙江形象展区，浙江舜浦工艺美术品股份有限公司的草编帽、草编手袋等非遗产品吸引了许多人。去年，舜浦的出口占比将近六成，产品销往40多个国家和地区。不过，在全球消费萎缩、美国关税陡增之下，今年舜浦以国内市场为主，想要打响自己的品牌。
　　打开舜浦的小红书账号，今年的更新频率更高、产出内容更精致。“大家都在‘卷’电商，要做出特色并不容易，我们已经扩大了营销团队。”企业外联负责人谢逸宁说。
　　在宁波展区，记者结识了一群从事中东欧商品进口贸易的创业者，从进口商品的角度看国内市场开拓，他们也遇到了相似的品牌问题。
　　兰月主要经销希腊、斯洛伐克的巧克力和酒，在她看来，要快速打开内贸市场确实不容易。“中国的产品太多了，消费者会优先选大品牌，品牌不够知名就难以打开销路。”这些年，她跑展会、找代理、做营销，不断拓展平台和渠道。
　　但转换思路，这些产品有品质优势，还有历史文化沉淀。“小众不等于不好，反而是稀缺。”这是她最近的思考，“中国市场更新换代非常快，尤其是在电商选品时，如果能找到特色、讲出故事，小众品牌就有机会成为‘宝藏好物’，被年轻人接受。”因此，她也希望在消博会找到专业的电商合作伙伴。
　　 多元市场怎么拓
　　除了转向内销，发掘海外多元市场也是应对“对等关税”的举措。
　　2018年中美贸易摩擦以来，外贸企业都深知单一市场的风险。比如消费电子类产品的不少元器件从美国进口，关税增加导致零部件成本上升；成品出口时，关税转嫁到商品定价，也冲击了美国市场的销量。因此，很多企业早已开始谋划“把鸡蛋放在不同的篮子里”。
　　走进浙江形象展区，浙江极客桥智能装备股份有限公司的工作人员正在演示照明无人机。作为全球唯一一家量产照明无人机的企业，极客桥近三年大力拓展多元海外市场。
　　企业创始人胡克飞告诉记者，公司的营销人员走访了31个国家和地区，已接到来自欧洲、中东等市场的订单。这些照明无人机应用广泛，将进入应急救援、煤矿、体育、影视拍摄等多个领域。他特别看好中东市场，“因为气候炎热，人们有大量的夜间户外活动需求，市场潜力非常大。”
　　今年，极客桥还计划在日本成立分公司，进一步建设经销点和生产基地，提升全球供应链的安全稳定性。
　　“以前我们认为‘一流企业做品牌、三流企业做产品’，但未来逻辑也许会转变。谁有创新力、制造力，谁才有话语权。”在胡克飞看来，最终要靠产品力说话，“只有品牌没有制造，产品就无法落地。把制造核心环节掌握在自己手里，中国制造也会成为最大的‘品牌’。”
　　同样在日本布局，今年以来，浙江毫微科技有限公司迎来爆发式增长。
　　该公司主营采集仓和3D打印设备，去年结合二次元手办文化，开发出自助3D打印设备，可以让动漫爱好者打造自己的手办。“日本是‘动漫之都’，本身有很庞大的二次元受众基础，去年我们尝试对接日本客户，产品很快受到市场欢迎。”浙江毫微科技3D打印首席运营官陈涛说。
　　目前，毫微科技的产品还进入到新加坡、南非等新兴市场。“近几月订单已经排队，制作周期从15天延长到20天甚至1个月。”他说，企业计划明年开发中东欧和中东地区的业务。
　　事实上，即使没有“对等关税”，拓展多元市场也是企业的长远发展目标。
　　“穿越周期的企业，不会去纠结不可控因素，而是始终推进全球化布局和供应链优化。”王鹏铖说，凯喜雅10年前布局的东南亚生产基地，近些年对冲了部分关税风险；今年，凯喜雅谋划在欧洲布局生产基地，同步推进转内与拓外，让海内外供应链体系更加稳定可控。
　　在美国“对等关税”的纷扰之外，中国的巨大市场向世界打开，全球71个国家和地区、4100多个品牌来到海南，拓展合作版图、共享发展机遇仍然是这个时代的核心命题。",2025-04-17T01:42:00.000+03:00,https://zjnews.zjol.com.cn/zjnews/202504/t20250417_30942760.shtml,,positive

Soja sobe em Chicago com dólar mais fraco e ameaças tarifárias precificadas,"Soja sobe em Chicago com dólar mais fraco e ameaças tarifárias precificadas
Os contratos futuros da soja em Chicago ganharam força nesta quarta-feira (16), devido ao enfraquecimento do dólar e a um relatório de que a China estaria aberta a negociações comerciais com os EUA, embora a grande oferta da América do Sul e a demanda chinesa quase inexistente por grãos americanos continuassem a pairar sobre o mercado, disseram os analistas.
Os futuros do milho e do trigo subiram, também apoiados por um novo enfraquecimento do dólar americano, o que torna as exportações dos EUA mais competitivas.
O contrato de soja mais ativo subiu 2,75 centavos, para US$10,3875 por bushel.

O milho ganhou 2,25 centavos, para US$4,9175 por bushel, e o trigo subiu 5 centavos, para US$5,61 por bushel.
O índice do dólar voltou a se aproximar das mínimas de três anos atingidas depois que o presidente dos EUA, Donald Trump, anunciou suas políticas tarifárias.
A China, de longe o maior comprador de soja dos EUA, impôs tarifas retaliatórias aos Estados Unidos, o que tornará mais cara a importação de safras americanas.
No entanto, a situação “baixista” da guerra comercial em curso já foi considerada no mercado, disseram os analistas. Na quarta-feira, uma reportagem da Bloomberg afirmando que o governo chinês estaria aberto a negociações comerciais criou um sentimento positivo no mercado e fortaleceu os futuros da soja.
“Isso está aumentando o otimismo de que talvez as negociações comerciais possam começar mais cedo ou mais tarde”, disse Randy Place, analista da Hightower Report.

美债风暴前一个月，美国海外债主持有的美债创2021年6月来最大增幅_手机新浪网,"美债风暴前一个月，美国海外债主持有的美债创2021年6月来最大增幅
来源：华尔街见闻
美东时间4月16日周三，美国财政部公布国际资本流动报告（TIC）显示，今年2月美国的海外债主们持有的美国国债显著增长，为2021年6月以来的最大增幅。加拿大和日本是该月净买入量位居前列的国家，而该月正值美债市场近期动荡的前夕。
截至今年2月末，美国以外国家持有的美国国债总额增加2900亿美元，达到创纪录的8.82万亿美元。当月，外国买家净购买了1062亿美元的长期美债和732亿美元的短期美债。
日本2月所持美国国债增加466亿美元，是自2020年2月以来的最大增幅，至1.13万亿美元，为2024年4月以来的最高水平。自2019年6月持仓超越中国大陆以来，日本一直是美国国债最大的海外持有国。
华尔街见闻网站此前提到，去年日本的美债持仓变动，一度被视为干预汇市压力下的调整。为了稳定日元汇率采取的干预需要日本掌握充足“弹药”，因此不得不减持包括美债在内的美元资产筹资。例如，有媒体援引数据称，去年7月日本投入366亿美元干预汇市。不过，去年8月和9月，日元兑美元强劲反弹，日本政府暂时没有支持日元的需求，失去了抛美债的一大动力。
中国大陆2月所持美债增加235亿美元，至7843亿美元。当月中国净卖出了48亿美元的长期美国国债，同时净买入了151亿美元的短期国债。整体持有量的增长也部分反映了2月美国国债价格的上涨。
从2022年4月起，中国大陆的美债持仓一直低于1万亿美元，截至今年2月，仍是仅次于日本的第二大美债持有国家地区。大体来说，中国大陆的美债持仓增加的月份与当月美债价格上涨吻合。
分析普遍认为，鉴于中美关系变化和外储资产配置多元化的趋势，中国的美国国债持仓仍可能稳步下降。未来中国持仓的波动很大程度上仍受中美关系影响。
近年来，中国大陆减持美债更多来自外储资产多元化配置的需要，提升黄金;)配置占比就是促进多元化配置的一种体现。截至去年4月，中国央行曾创纪录地连续18个月增持黄金，此后一度暂时收手，不过近来又恢复购入黄金的操作。本月稍早公布的数据显示，3月末中国黄金储备为7370万盎司，较2月末的7361万盎司增加9万盎司，这是自2024年11月以来，中国央行连续第五个月增持黄金储备。
加拿大在1月净卖出美债后，2月美债持仓大幅反弹，净买入465亿美元的长期美债。有分析人士指出，今年1月，美国总统特朗普向加拿大施压，目前双边紧张局势进一步加剧。
英国是第三大美债海外债主，2月持有量增加了101亿美元，达7503亿美元。
开曼群岛（被认为是对冲基金等杠杆投资者的热门注册地）2月美债持有量增加了133亿美元，达到4178亿美元。市场人士表示，近期美国国债市场的波动部分源于对冲基金解除所谓的“基差交易”策略。
周三的数据还显示，阿联酋今年前两个月的美债持仓大幅增加近430亿美元，总额达到1199亿美元，几乎是去年1月时的两倍。
分析称，最新的TIC数据反映了特朗普宣布大规模加征关税约一个月前，外国投资者对美债的强烈需求。在其4月2日宣布关税措施后，29万亿美元的美国国债市场遭遇了自2001年以来最严重的抛售。
未来几个月的TIC数据将被密切关注，以判断各国是否正在减少美债持有量。虽然4月的美债持仓数据要等到6月才会公布，但部分市场参与者对此说法持怀疑态度。从长期趋势看，外国投资者在美国国债市场中的占比已经从2008年超过一半的峰值下降，彭博汇编数据显示，近年来该占比约为30%。
美国财政部的TIC数据还显示：
- 2月份，包括长期证券、美国短期证券、以及银行资金流的所有外资净流入总额为2847亿美元。其中，私人外资净流入为2293亿美元，官方外资净流入为554亿美元。
- 2月份，外国居民增持了美国长期证券，净买入规模为1427亿美元。其中，外国私人投资者的净买入为1661亿美元，而外国官方机构则净卖出234亿美元。
- 美国居民在1月份增持了长期外国证券，净买入规模为307亿美元。
- 经过调整后，例如估计外国投资组合通过股票互换收购美国股票，1月份外国对长期证券的净卖出总额估计为1120亿美元。
- 外国居民增持了短期证券美国国库券732亿美元。外国居民持有的所有以美元计价的短期美国证券和其他托管负债增加了799亿美元。
- 银行自身对外国居民的以美元计价的净负债增加了928亿美元。
美国财政部今年3月的TIC数据，定于2025年5月16日发布。

破局融资困境 广发银行精准滴灌民营小微的硬核突围,"“公司研发投入大，资金需求强烈。银行投放信贷一般看重的是企业过往营收数据，我们这种处于发展初期的科创企业很难贷到款。”杭州云栖智慧视通科技有限公司行政总经理张倩说，“广发银行杭州分行‘科信贷’产品给予我们很大支持，有效解决了融资难题。”
　　智慧视通是一家专注形体（形态）识别核心技术的人工智能行业专精特新企业，其核心产品广泛应用于“AI+公共安全”“AI+智慧能源”“AI+智慧医疗”等领域。针对企业轻资产、高成长性的特点，广发银行杭州分行为企业落地500万元免抵押、类信用的“科信贷”额度，目前企业已使用300万元。
　　在浙江这个民营经济高度活跃的省份，还有多家与智慧视通类似的享受到广发银行金融服务的民营企业。中国证券报记者近日在浙江调研了解到，广发银行多措并举，在惠企利民上出实招，从优服务、降成本、提效率三个维度发力，切实提升小微企业金融服务的获得感和满意度。目前，广发银行的小微及民营贷款整体呈现“量增、价降、质优”的良好态势。
　　 服务独角兽和瞪羚企业
　　与传统企业相比，科创企业尤其是处于初创期的科创企业，固定资产有限，缺乏抵押物，前期的研发投入较大，盈利不确定性较高，传统信贷模式很难匹配科创企业的发展特点。为此，广发银行一改传统侧重财务指标的授信策略，变为侧重通过对企业进行综合评价，提供金融服务。
　　“科信贷”是广发银行针对科技型中小微企业轻资产、高成长性的特点，通过免抵押方式为其办理短期融资的金融产品，分行结合企业技术能力、知识产权情况以及发展前景等因素进行综合评估，通过免抵押、类信用的方式，为企业提供授信支持。
　　广发银行余杭分行副行长姚佳颖介绍，智慧视通是该行“科信贷”的首批客户之一，双方于2021年下半年建立信贷合作。彼时，该公司未实现盈利，该行通过综合积分卡对企业的一系列要素进行评估，判断企业的整体发展情况，最终为企业落地了500万元免抵押、类信用，可以无还本续贷的“科信贷”额度。
　　杭州光粒科技有限公司是一家专注AR底层光学技术的专精特新企业，该公司也曾面临研发投入高、融资渠道窄、抗风险能力弱等难题。“广发银行对我们的经营状况、研发实力和市场前景进行综合评估后，给予了800万元授信额度支持，并且持续关注，提供全方位、个性化的金融服务。”杭州光粒科技有限公司相关负责人说。
　　据广发银行杭州分行公司金融部副总经理蒋轶艳介绍，截至2023年末，浙江省独角兽企业约有30家，该行对此类企业采取主动营销策略，通过多元化综合金融服务提升客户的体验感，目前已有企业与该行开展合作。截至2023年末，浙江省约有300家瞪羚企业，集中在人工智能、大数据、新能源、生物技术等领域。该类企业主要为增长快、创新能力和市场竞争力强的中小科创企业。广发银行杭州分行结合政府“企业创新积分制”试点工作，推出“科技积分贷”产品，根据企业的不同成长阶段，提供差异化的金融服务方案。
　　 构建信贷专案模式
　　针对小微企业融资难题，广发银行还开发构建了信贷专案模式，即推动和指导各分行根据当地经济发展状况和区域特点，因地制宜、因城施策，充分利用好当地的行业特色、产业集群和重点领域，一户一策形成特色专案，在授信主体、经营实体、担保方式、授信方案、风险策略等方面进行差异化调整，引导信贷资金直达小微企业。
　　义乌国际商贸城是全球最大的小商品批发市场，经营面积640余万平方米，经营商位达7.5万个，商品涵盖玩具、饰品、箱包、文具、美妆、服饰等类别。在商贸城嘉轩织带商行店铺内的货架上摆放着各式各样的丝带，据老板高晶介绍，她家的丝带主要出口到东南亚、非洲、欧美等地。由于与外商结款有一定的周期，有时需要借助银行信贷资金进行周转。
　　了解到嘉轩织带商行资金需求后，广发银行向其提供了“商城E贷”产品。据广发银行义乌分行副行长杨畅介绍，“商城E贷”是该行为商贸城商户打造的专属信贷产品，基于义乌国际商贸城提供的商户征信数据，用户只需要在线上提交申请，最快几分钟就能完成审批，最高授信额度50万元，随借随还，按天计息，已有近500家商户使用了该产品。高晶表示，她从2020年开始使用“商城E贷”，已借贷很多次，直接在手机上操作，十分方便。
　　针对小微企业的信贷需求，广发银行在丰富普惠产品供给上做“加法”，持续加大产品创设力度。广发银行党委委员、副行长林德明表示，该行聚焦外贸、民营、科创等重点领域，推出“商城E贷”“专精特新E贷”“惠易贷”等标准化产品，全行现有普惠金融产品17个，形成功能完备的普惠金融产品体系，持续扩大普惠金融覆盖面，培育金融服务实体经济的新动能。
　　截至2024年末，广发银行普惠型小微企业贷款余额1961亿元，比年初增加175.1亿元，增长9.8%，超过各项贷款增速6.3个百分点，民营企业贷款余额5132亿元，较年初增加396亿元，增长8.3%。
　　 满足综合金融需求
　　广发银行普惠金融部副总经理吴海盛介绍，作为 中国人寿 （ 601628 ）集团成员单位，该行充分发挥中国人寿集团的综合金融资源以及行内公司、交银、投行、托管、金市等各条线产品资源的协同优势，建立“扶持+陪伴”“融资+融智”的立体化服务，构建“信贷+”综合金融服务模式，把具有广发特色的综合金融服务送达更多小微企业，全方位满足小微企业和个人客群的综合金融需求。
　　吴海盛表示，一方面，利用中国人寿集团综合金融业务产品，提供适配的保险保障服务和养老保障服务，切实解决小微企业和个人客群的风险规避需求，实现从以信贷业务为主，转为向企业、企业主以及员工个人提供立体化综合金融产品。
　　另一方面，以客户需求为导向，持续延伸和丰富“信贷+”服务供给理念，在小微信贷业务支持基础上，构建类别齐全、策略丰富、层次清晰的企业日常管理、普惠理财等综合金融服务体系。
　　吴海盛表示，针对小微企业普遍缺乏数字化人才、数字化转型成本较高的痛点，广发银行还全面整合数字人资、数字财税及数字差旅三大解决方案，推出“人财事”一站式经营管理服务的系统“数企通”，包括人事管理、财务管理、费控管理三大免费功能模块，为广大中小微企业提供更便捷、更高效的定制化金融服务。",2025-04-17T01:11:00.000+03:00,http://news.10jqka.com.cn/20250417/c667524772.shtml,中国证券报,positive

La capital de Panamá aceptará criptomonedas para impuestos y tasas municipales,"La capital de Panamá aceptará criptomonedas para impuestos y tasas municipales
La ciudad capital de Panamá aceptará pagos en criptomonedas para impuestos y tasas municipales, incluyendo boletos de autobús y permisos, anunció el alcalde de la Ciudad de Panamá, Mayer Mizrachi, el 15 de abril, uniéndose a una lista creciente de jurisdicciones a nivel mundial que han votado por aceptar dichos pagos.
La Ciudad de Panamá comenzará a aceptar Bitcoin BTCUSD, Ether ETHUSD, la stablecoin USDC de Circle USDCUSD y la stablecoin USDt de Tether USDTUSD para pagos una vez que se establezcan los sistemas de conversión de criptomonedas a moneda fiat, según publicó Mizrachi en la plataforma X.
Mizrachi indicó que administraciones anteriores intentaron impulsar una legislación similar, pero no lograron superar las estipulaciones que requerían que el gobierno local aceptara fondos denominados en dólares estadounidenses.
En una declaración traducida, el alcalde de la Ciudad de Panamá dijo que el gobierno local se asoció con un banco que convertirá inmediatamente cualquier criptoactivo recibido en dólares estadounidenses, permitiendo al municipio aceptar criptomonedas sin introducir nueva legislación.
La Ciudad de Panamá se une a una lista creciente de jurisdicciones globales a nivel municipal y estatal que aceptan pagos en criptomonedas para impuestos, exploran reservas estratégicas de Bitcoin para proteger los tesoros públicos de la inflación y aprueban políticas pro-criptomonedas para atraer inversiones.
Municipios y estados adoptan criptoactivos
Varios municipios y territorios alrededor del mundo ya aceptan criptomonedas para el pago de impuestos o están explorando diversas implementaciones de la tecnología blockchain para el gasto gubernamental.
El estado de Colorado, en Estados Unidos, comenzó a aceptar pagos en criptomonedas para impuestos en septiembre de 2022. Al igual que lo anunciado por la Ciudad de Panamá, Colorado convierte inmediatamente las criptomonedas a fiat.
En diciembre de 2023, la ciudad de Lugano, Suiza, anunció que los impuestos y las tasas municipales podían ser pagados en Bitcoin, lo que fue uno de los desarrollos que le valió la reputación de ser una ciudad reconocida mundialmente por su adopción de Bitcoin.
El consejo municipal de Vancouver, Canadá, aprobó una moción para convertirse en una ""ciudad amigable con Bitcoin"" en diciembre de 2024. Como parte de esa moción, el gobierno local de Vancouver explorará la integración de BTC en el sistema financiero, incluyendo los pagos de impuestos.
El legislador de Carolina del Norte, Neal Jackson, presentó una legislación titulada ""Ley de Libertad de Activos Digitales de Carolina del Norte"" el 10 de abril. De ser aprobada, la ley reconocerá las criptomonedas como una forma oficial de pago que puede ser utilizada para pagar impuestos.

练就干事成事的真本领|全会_新浪财经_新浪网,"省委十四届八次全会向全省发出坚定信心、实干争先的号召，强调必须进一步形成想干事、能干事、干成事的浓厚氛围。贯彻落实好省委十四届八次全会精神，作为年轻干部，应以实干之姿，练就担当的宽肩膀，成事的真本领，始终牢记党的嘱托、不负人民期望，走好蜕变之路。
破除躺平心态，打破固有标签。当下，年轻人的负面标签频频出现在各大社交平台上，纵观互联网上的热词，“躺平”一词备受关注。对于干部来说，在理应干事创业的时候选择拈轻躺平的原因，还是因为理想信念不够坚定、党性修养不够高、作风锤炼不扎实。这才导致其在面对急难险重时左躲右闪，不担当、不作为，遇到困难选择躺平。年轻干部正值精力充沛、思维活跃、接受能力强的年龄阶段，正处在长本事、长才干的大好时期，面对困难和挑战应做到不抱怨、不推诿、不逃避，始终保持积极向上的心态和昂扬斗志，主动投身到乡村振兴、基层治理等工作中去，把压力化作成长养分，用实际行动在困境中破冰开路。
冲破畏难情绪，彰显担当作为。一些年轻干部存在专业能力、知识储备等不匹配工作岗位实际要求的情况，但却不深入学习，也不勤思好问，导致不会干更不愿干的现状。这一现象从侧面反映出其存在畏难情绪、退缩心理，是学风作风不实的缘故。年轻干部肩负着时代赋予的重任，应时刻秉持着“狭路相逢勇者胜”的坚定信念，敢于向困难“亮剑”。面对工作中的难题，应依靠学习克服“本领恐慌”，持之以恒勤学苦练，脚踏实地自我完善，真正让自己在解决矛盾中经风雨、见世面、壮筋骨、长才干。坚持学以致用，积极响应组织号召，主动投身改革发展第一线、重大任务斗争最前沿，到艰苦复杂地方和关键吃劲岗位去磨炼，在服务群众的实践中出真知出成果。
打破迷茫困境，践行初心使命。年轻干部人生阅历、社会经历相对单一，抵御腐蚀拉拢的意识和经验相对不足，面对纷繁复杂的环境容易迷失自我，陷入“围猎”圈套。这就需要年轻干部坚守初心使命，坚定理想信念，时刻牢记自己的职责和使命，自觉抵制各种诱惑，做到“见贤思齐焉，见不贤而内自省也”。以先进典型为镜，以反面典型为鉴，始终保持如履薄冰、如临深渊的警醒，不触碰党纪国法的“高压线”，用好“遵纪守法”这个最大的“护身符”。守牢“八小时外”纪律底线，存敬畏、守纪律、讲规矩、明底线，自觉抵制“私欲”、摒弃“利欲”、战胜“物欲”，努力成为政治上的明白人、工作上的老实人、生活上的干净人。",2025-04-17T00:15:00.000+03:00,https://finance.sina.com.cn/jjxw/2025-04-17/doc-inetmcye6330607.shtml,sina.com.cn,positive

Donald Trump says 'big progress' made in Japan talks on tariff deal - CNBC TV18,"2 Min Read
President Donald Trump said negotiators made “big progress” in a meeting with Japanese officials seeking a deal to avoid higher levies he has threatened against US trading partners.
“A Great Honor to have just met with the Japanese Delegation on Trade. Big Progress!” Trump posted Wednesday on his social media site following the meeting.
Foreign capitals are racing to negotiate deals with the US to avert high import taxes Trump imposed — and then quickly paused — on about 60 trading partners. That move put a 24% across-the-board tariff on Japanese imports on hold, though a 10% baseline charge still applies — as well as 25% levies on cars, steel and aluminum.
The Japan talks are being closely watched as a test case for other nations uncertain over what concessions Trump will seek to extract.
Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has said Japan, a military ally, will likely be prioritized as the US deals with a flood of nations all looking to cut their own deals.
Bessent has said he envisions reaching agreements with Japan and other US partners to harness a collective effort to apply economic pressure on China.
Japan is expected to offer the US a broad deal as it urges Trump to drop the 24% duty. During a February meeting with Trump, Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba promised to buy more American liquid natural gas and raise investment in the US to $1 trillion.
Japanese leaders have touted Japan’s standing as the biggest investor in America, including factories built by Japan’s automakers that have created US jobs.

Genomma Lab refuerza su presencia en la Argentina con una reinversión de US$50 millones | TN,"En medio de un escenario económico desafiante, la empresa Genomma Lab anunció una fuerte apuesta por el mercado argentino. La compañía, una de las principales del sector farmacéutico y de cuidado personal en América Latina, comunicó que invertirá US$50 millones en la Argentina a lo largo de los próximos tres años.
El desembolso estará enfocado en dos frentes clave: por un lado, la adquisición de marcas que complementen su portafolio —actualmente en evaluación— y por otro, el desarrollo de infraestructura productiva para sostener su crecimiento en el país. La inversión será financiada con utilidades previamente generadas en Argentina y que permanecían retenidas a causa de las restricciones cambiarias vigentes hasta días atrás.

“Ante la nueva fase del plan económico anunciado por el Gobierno, Genomma felicita al presidente Javier Milei y a su ministro de Desregulación y Transformación del Estado, Federico Sturzenegger , por el avance del plan que, sin dudas, traerá prosperidad al pueblo argentino”, señalaron desde la empresa en un comunicado oficial.

"Hochul, DAs say NY discovery law deal is 'very, very close' in budget breakthrough - NewsBreak","Let’s make a whatever-you-call-it. Gov. Kathy Hochul acknowledged Wednesday that lawmakers had reached a breakthrough in negotiations to revamp the state’s discovery laws — even as she insisted it didn’t count as a “deal.” The governor instead opted for wonky jargon, describing the end of a budget stalemate revealed the day before by Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie (D-Bronx) as a “conceptual agreement” different from a done deal. “I think we’re very, very close to being done and perhaps, today will be the day we say, ‘Pens are down,'” Hochul said during a news conference. Hochul plans to meet with Heastie and Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins (D-Westchester) Wednesday evening. Kathy Hochul gets scrambled for claiming she ‘can’t afford’ eggs for Easter event A deal — or a deal by another name — likely will clear a major logjam to passing New York’s massive $252 proposed budget, which has been held up for weeks by Hochul refusing to budge on her policy asks, especially changes to discovery Hochul stopped short of voicing support for the plan crafted by Albany Democrats and approved by all five New York City district attorneys. But rumors swirled around Albany after the deal was announced Tuesday that it was falling apart, prompting Heastie to clear the air. “Everything is still fine conceptually. Staff is going back and forth on drafting,” Heastie told The Post. Hochul’s ‘common sense’ push to close labor law loophole facing resistance as budget talks drag on While Hochul contended there’s no deal over discovery, last year she unveiled the state budget deal by calling it the “parameters of a conceptual agreement” — almost the exact same term Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez used to describe the state of play on discovery. Changing discovery laws was one of Hochul’s big priorities in the budget talks with state lawmakers, along with making it easier to involuntarily commit mentally ill people — a pair of policy pitches that grew from public safety concerns in the Big Apple. The city’s DAs, including Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, argued that the state’s 2019 discovery reforms led to a surge in criminal case dismissals based on often-trivial technicalities. Hochul backed their proposal to tweak the laws, narrowing the scope of evidence prosecutors have to turn over to defense attorneys and setting a 35-day time limit to challenge violations. Critics such as The Legal Aid Society, however, pushed lawmakers to stand firm against the changes — contending they’d give prosecutors too much power. They also argued the surge in dismissals is largely seen in New York City and stems from the NYPD failing to share evidence with prosecutors. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR METRO DAILY NEWSLETTER Despite the pushback, Heastie said Tuesday that Dems had reached a “framework” over discovery changes. The deal would: Three of New York City’s district attorneys — Gonzalez, Bragg and Staten Island’s Michael McMahon — flanked Hochul during her news conference, which was part of a tour pushing for the discovery changes. Gonzalez said the legislative teams from the DAs and Heastie’s and Stewart-Cousin’s offices were crafting the actual language for changes. “Every word matters in a statute, because if a word is off or a standard is off, it changes the entire interpretation,” he said. “We want to make sure that the language is clear that judges will have discretion to independently and individually review each case, and that a judge would not feel that they have to dismiss a case because a document is missing.” For the latest metro stories, top headlines, breaking news and more, visit nypost.com/metro/",2025-04-17T00:52:00.000+03:00,https://www.newsbreak.com/new-york-post-509648/3965936978324-hochul-das-say-ny-discovery-law-deal-is-very-very-close-in-budget-breakthrough,"Vaughn Golden, Hannah Fierick, Matt Troutman",positive

Woodside CEO Meg O’Neill said these agreements represent another important milestone to move Louisiana LNG towards a final investment decision.
“We are delighted to advance our longstanding relationship with Uniper through these milestone supply agreements.

The addition of Atlantic Basin LNG supply to our established position in the Pacific strengthens Woodside’s portfolio and allows us to tailor contract structures based on various price indices and tenures to better meet our customers’ diverse needs.
“As we continue to progress sell-down opportunities for Louisiana LNG, these agreements reinforce the project’s unique advantages and its economic competitiveness.

“In an environment of increasing demand for dependable sources of LNG, particularly in Europe, we remain focused on delivering reliable energy supply that will benefit our partners and stakeholders for years to come,” she said.
Michael Lewis, Uniper CEO said, “We are very pleased to secure additional LNG supplies for our customers in Europe from a reliable LNG supplier like Woodside. This deal will support our security of supply and flexible generation strategy together with the potential development of additional gas-fired power plants in Germany to complement the renewable build-up. Woodside is one of our biggest LNG suppliers globally with a solid track record of deliveries of LNG to us from their existing projects.
“With this new project in Louisiana, we are further extending the cooperation with Woodside. Long-term LNG contracts like this contribute directly to the competitiveness of European industry. Reliable and cost-effective energy supply is a cornerstone of a strong industrial base, and deals like this help ensure our customers can count on both.”
Louisiana LNG LLC will supply 1.0 Mtpa of LNG on a free-on-board basis for up to thirteen years from the commercial operations date (COD) of Louisiana LNG.
In addition, Woodside Energy Trading Singapore Pty. Ltd. will supply up to 1.0 Mtpa of LNG on a delivered ex-ship basis from Woodside’s global portfolio into Europe commencing with Louisiana LNG’s COD over a term until 2039.

Mikel Arteta reaction - Gunners boss speaks after beating Real Madrid to reach Champions League semifinals,"Mikel Arteta reaction — Gunners boss speaks after beating Real Madrid to reach Champions League semifinals
Arsenal are through to the semifinals of the UEFA Champions after a hugely impressive 5-1 aggregate victory over reigning European champions Real Madrid, sealed by a 2-1 victory in the Spanish capital on Wednesday.
REAL MADRID 1-2 (1-5 AGG.) ARSENAL -
Highlights & recap
The Gunners rode the biggest and best performance of Mikel Arteta’s tenure (in the first leg) to the club’s first Champions League semifinal appearance since 2009 as they took the next step forward in Arteta’s project. Bukayo Saka rebounded from a first-half penalty miss to score the goal that (briefly) made it 4-0 before Vinicius Junior stole one back, but that’s as close as Carlo Ancelotti’s side would get on the night or in the tie. Second-best from start to finish. Gabriel Martinelli added the exclamation point in stoppage time, racing away from everyone, beating Thibaut Courtois and basking in the adoration of the traveling supporters seated high atop the Santiago Bernabeu.

Aprovado projeto que transforma multas leves e médias em advertência,"Deputados da Assembleia Legislativa de Mato Grosso do Sul aprovaram, nesta quarta-feira (16), projeto de lei que prevê a conversão de multas leves e médias em advertência. A proposta passou pela segunda votação e vai a sanção do governador Eduardo Riedel (PSDB).
Conforme reportagem do Correio do Estado, essa proposta muda pontos da Lei número 4.282, de 2012, que trata dos valores de taxas da Tabela de Serviços do Departamento Estadual de Trânsito de Mato Grosso do Sul (Detran-MS).
Conforme o texto acrescido à norma, para se livrar de possíveis multas o motorista fica condicionado a ter um bom comportamento no período de um ano, imediatamente anterior à infração observada.
Ou seja, caso não tenha cometido outra infração nos últimos 12 meses, o condutor poderá se livrar de possíveis multas de natureza média ou leve.
Isso porque, antes de aplicar a multa, o agente fiscalizador deverá examinar o Sistema Nacional de Trânsito (SNT) sobre as informações contidas no prontuário dos condutores e veículos.
O presidente da Casa de Leis, deputado Gerson Claro (PP) é autor do Projeto de Lei, com coautoria do deputado Paulo Duarte (PSB), que justificam a apresentação do PL ""a fim de evitar prejuízo ao direito dos condutores e a arrecadação indevida de multas que deveriam ser convertidas em advertências escritas"".
“Existe uma previsão legal federal para a possibilidade de converter multa em advertência quando há multa de natureza de leve a média, ocorre a maioria dos Departamentos Estaduais de Trânsito [Detrans] estão fazendo isso tornar-se lei e não ser de definição do Detran, e sim, obrigatório, uma vez que for identificado no sistema somente uma multa, que seja convertida em advertência, isso passa a ser obrigatório com esse projeto”, ressaltou.
Multas de trânsito
Pelo Código de Trânsito Brasileiro, infrações cometidas por condutores de veículos são passíveis de penalidade, que pode varia conforme a gravidade, com a seguinte classificação:
- Leve: R$ 88,38 e 3 pontos na CNH
- Média: R$ 130,16 e 4 pontos na CNH

"Despite DeSantis opposition, Florida House passes university presidential search bill","TALLAHASSEE — Amid fierce opposition from Gov. Ron DeSantis, the Florida House on Wednesday approved revamping laws about leadership of the higher education system, including opening information about applicants to become college and university presidents.
The House voted 104-8 to pass the bill ( HB 1321 ), which would repeal a 2022 law that provided exemptions to public records and public meetings laws for presidential searches . It also includes ending the state university system Board of Governors’ role in confirming presidential selections made by university boards of trustees and trying to limit the influence of the governor and other officials on presidential selections.
“We have a fantastic education system,” bill sponsor Michelle Salzman, R-Pensacola, said. “This is not about what we have. This is about showing the voters what we’re doing. This is about transparency in government.”
But DeSantis, during an appearance Tuesday in Pensacola, blasted the proposed changes and raised the specter of a veto if the bill passes. He said he needs to have authority to make sure universities “don’t run off the rails.”
“It removes the ability of us to ensure that we’re holding universities accountable,” he said.
Salzman said the bill is not an attack on DeSantis. But it came amid clashes between the House and DeSantis on a series of issues — and after former lawmakers in recent years have been appointed to lead several colleges and universities.
Last month, House Speaker Daniel Perez, R-Miami, went before the Board of Governors to support the bill and compared the college and university presidential search process to a “spoils system.”
Among the selections in recent years, former state House Majority Leader Adam Hasner became president of Florida Atlantic University; former House Speaker Richard Corcoran became president of New College of Florida; former Rep. Mel Ponder became president of Northwest Florida State College; former Rep. Tommy Gregory became president of State College of Florida, Manatee-Sarasota; and former Rep. Fred Hawkins became president of South Florida State College.
In February, former Lt. Gov. Jeanette Nuñez , also a former lawmaker, became interim president of Florida International University. In addition to Florida International, the University of Florida and Florida A&M University are operating with interim presidents, and University of South Florida President Rhea Law has announced she is stepping down.
Under the 2022 law providing public records and public meetings exemptions, identifying information about most presidential applicants is not disclosed, though information about finalists for the positions is made public.
Supporters of the law argued that it was needed to help attract top candidates who might be hesitant to apply for Florida president jobs if their current employers could find out.
Rep. Mike Caruso, a Delray Beach Republican who opposed the bill Wednesday, questioned what had changed since 2022. He said the law was about balancing transparency and the need to attract candidates.
Salzman said lawmakers supported the 2022 law after receiving assurances that information about the top three finalists for presidencies would be made public. But she said the way the process has played out “created a huge level of distrust” among people across the state.
Currently, university boards of trustees pick presidents, but the Board of Governors must sign off on the picks. The bill would eliminate the Board of Governors’ role in giving approval.
Also, it would set term limits for members of the Board of Governors, the State Board of Education and university and college boards of trustees. The State Board of Education oversees the college system.
In addition, the bill would prevent the governor and other state officials from discussing vacancies or advocating for presidential candidates with members of the Board of Governors, the State Board of Education and university and college trustees.
Salzman described that as imposing a “cone of silence” on officials during presidential searches.
A similar Senate bill ( SB 1726 ) has cleared two committees and would need approval from the Rules Committee before it could go to the full Senate.
In addition to Caruso, the House bill was opposed Wednesday by Rep. Wallace Aristide, D-Miami; Rep. Ryan Chamberlin, R-Belleview; Rep. Tom Fabricio, R-Miami Lakes; Rep. Yvonne Hinson, D-Gainesville; Rep. Chip LaMarca, R-Lighthouse Point; Rep. Patt Maney, R-Shalimar; and Rep. Kiyan Michael, R-Jacksonville.

高水平分红积极影响市场生态 _ 东方财富网,"进入年报披露期，A股上市公司掀起年度分红热潮，密集披露2024年年度分红预案，扎堆派发现金“大礼包”，备受市场关注。
　　无论是从参与现金分红的上市公司数量，还是从年度分红总额，抑或是从分红金额占净利润比例来看，均透露出上市公司分红诚意在提升、分红行为趋稳定、分红水平更优化。证监会统计数据显示，2024年沪深上市公司分红达到2.4万亿元，分红金额创历史新高；全市场共有3973家上市公司进行了现金分红，数量保持全球第一。
　　规模大、占比高、增长稳，上市公司慷慨解囊，积极分红，既是取之于市场、回馈于市场的具体体现，更是高质量发展的一面多棱镜，显现出多方面积极信号。
　　投资者利益被放在更为重要的位置。自去年以来，A股上市公司积极践行以“投资者为本”的发展理念，踊跃开展“提质增效重回报”行动，聚焦主业、做好经营、优化治理，多措并举回馈投资者，回报诚意足、力度强。尤其是分红派现可以直接增加投资者的现金收益，提高投资回报率，成为上市公司反哺股东的抢手工具。多家上市公司在分红预案中直言，分红旨在与投资者共享公司成长成果，维护投资者利益，提升投资者获得感，用现金红包托起投资者“稳稳的幸福”。
　　上市公司经营质量持续提升。分红分的是真金白银，大手笔、持续稳定分红，反映出上市公司盈利能力稳定、现金流充沛、财务健康，有意愿有能力进行价值创造和价值分配。这点从目前已披露的上市公司年报中可窥见一二，当前A股市场有约1200家上市公司披露2024年年报，其中逾1000家公司实现盈利，占比超80%。反过来看，分红水平也正成为检验上市公司可持续经营能力的试金石，那些现金流充裕、基本面优越的优质公司，有望在这场“分红竞赛”中脱颖而出，赢得市场的长期青睐。
　　资本市场内在稳定性不断夯实。去年以来，党中央、国务院多次提出要稳住股市，一揽子有针对性的增量政策持续发力，超预期逆周期调节政策力度不断加大，资本市场新一轮改革向纵深推进，上市公司回报投资者的意识和能力持续强化，稳市场稳预期的责任担当更加凸显。尤其是近段时间，面对海外冲击，一大批上市公司果断出手增持、回购、提高分红比例或推动分红进展，用真金白银提振投资者信心，坚决守护自身价值，维护市场平稳运行，资本市场内在稳定机制的建设成效可感可及。
　　高水平、大力度分红对市场生态的积极影响正在显现。购买股票能像房东收租一样年年有稳定收益，长期可预期的股息礼包降低了投资者对短期股价波动的焦虑，引导资金从过度追求短期差价转向注重“短期股息+长期增值”的双重收益，促进市场向价值投资、长期投资转变。同时，分红竞赛也能倒逼上市公司提升经营水平、增强盈利能力，要求公司平衡好股东回报和企业长远发展，推动上市公司从重融资转向重回报、重经营。
　　当越来越多上市公司以高质量发展为舵，以投资者回报为帆，投融资更加协调的市场生态有望加快形成，进而推动资本市场行稳致远，助力中国经济航船乘风破浪、稳健前行。

"Misionero estadounidense Josh Sullivan, es rescatado","Misionero estadounidense Josh Sullivan, es rescatado ""milagrosamente ileso"" tras ser secuestrado
Cinco días después de ser secuestrado por hombres armados de su iglesia en Motherwell, Sudáfrica, el misionero de Tennessee, Josh Sullivan, fue rescatado y ""milagrosamente ileso"" tras un intenso tiroteo que dejó tres muertos.
Un comunicado del Servicio de Policía Sudafricano indicó que el tiroteo ocurrió en una casa de seguridad en KwaMagxaki, Gqeberha, donde el pastor de 34 años se encontraba cautivo.
Estamos en WhatsApp. [Empieza a seguirnos ahora]
""Al acercarse los agentes a la casa, observaron un vehículo en el recinto. Los sospechosos que se encontraban dentro del vehículo, al ver a las fuerzas del orden, supuestamente intentaron huir y abrieron fuego contra el equipo. Los agentes respondieron con precisión táctica, lo que provocó un intenso tiroteo en el que tres sospechosos no identificados resultaron heridos de muerte"", según el comunicado.
""La víctima fue encontrada dentro del mismo vehículo desde el que los sospechosos lanzaron el ataque. Milagrosamente ileso, fue evaluado de inmediato por personal médico y se encuentra en excelente estado"".
El comunicado indicó que la investigación del secuestro aún está en curso y pidió ""privacidad para la víctima y su familia mientras atraviesan este período de recuperación"".
Sullivan, quien dirige la Iglesia Bautista Fellowship en Motherwell, cerca de Gqeberha, antes conocido como Port Elizabeth, fue secuestrado por varios hombres armados durante un sermón en su iglesia el pasado 10 de abril. Los secuestradores habían exigido un rescate no revelado.
El secuestro desencadenó una campaña mundial de oración, que comenzó en la iglesia de Sullivan, Fellowship Baptist Church en Maryville, Tennessee, dirigida por el pastor Tom Hatley.
Hatley celebró el rescate el miércoles en un comunicado en Facebook, instando a sus seguidores a seguir orando por Sullivan y su familia.
""Josh ha sido liberado. Acabo de recibir la autorización para darlo a conocer"", escribió. ""Gracias por su apoyo y oraciones. Por favor, no dejen de orar por los Sullivan. ¡Alabado sea el Señor Jesucristo!"".
La secretaria de la iglesia, Heather Shirley, declaró a The Christian Post en una entrevista el miércoles que el único mensaje que se ha compartido con la iglesia sobre el rescate del pastor Sullivan hasta el momento es solamente que ha sido rescatado. Aún no han dado detalles sobre lo revelado por la policía local. También señaló que el milagroso rescate es exactamente lo que habían estado pidiendo en oración y alabó a Dios.
“Dios era quien lo protegía y cuidaba. Y eso era lo que pedíamos todo el tiempo: que lo cuidara y lo trajera a casa”, dijo Shirley, señalando que estaban deseando escuchar el testimonio de Sullivan de primera mano.
“Preferimos escucharlo de primera mano. Todo es más preciso si lo escuchas de primera mano. Queremos que Josh cuente la historia completa como él quiera o que nos dé algo que compartir con nuestra gente para que entiendan exactamente cómo se sintió”, añadió Shirley.
“No creo que ninguno de nosotros pueda entender cómo se sintió en esa situación. Es decir, tenía que haber una protección a su alrededor, provista por Dios; esa es la única explicación”.
La Iglesia Bautista Fellowship de Maryville señaló en un comunicado anterior que Sullivan y su esposa, Meagan, viajaron por primera vez a Sudáfrica en 2015 para realizar una pasantía de seis meses como parte de su formación bíblica.
“Fue durante este tiempo que el Señor comenzó a conmover sus corazones específicamente por el pueblo Xhosa. Ellos regresaron en 2018 como misioneros de tiempo completo para plantar iglesias, decididos a compartir el Evangelio y ver vidas transformadas”, afirma la biografía de la iglesia.
Sullivan pasó dos años en una escuela de idiomas para dominar el xhosa “y así poder predicar, discipular y ministrar con mayor eficacia”.
“Esa dedicación condujo a la fundación de la Iglesia Bautista Fellowship en el municipio de Motherwell, una comunidad que se ha convertido en su hogar”, afirmó la iglesia. La pareja también ha acogido a dos niños xhosa para que formen parte de su hogar en Sudáfrica.",2025-04-17T01:00:00.000+03:00,https://spanish.christianpost.com/news/misionero-estadounidense-josh-sullivan-es-rescatado-milagrosamente-ileso-tras-ser-secuestrado.html,@ChristianPost,positive

GREAT LAKES REGION
STATEMENT BY MR. JEROME BONNAFONT,
PERMANENT REPRESENTATIVE OF FRANCE TO THE UNITED NATIONS
TO THE SECURITY COUNCIL
New York, April 16, 2025
France reaffirms its support for the action of the United Nations in the region, that of the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General and MONUSCO, as well as that of humanitarian actors. In this regard, I would like to thank the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for the Great Lakes Region, Mr. Huang Xia, and the Executive Director of UNICEF, Ms. Catherine Russell, for their statements, in particular for their action. I thank Minister Tete Antonio for the elements he provided as chairperson of the Angolan Presidency of the African Union, and I welcome the presence of the Minister of State of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
Four messages from France today:
Firstly, the horrors that far too many children are facing and witnessing are proof that the humanitarian situation calls for action.
As Ms. Russell pointed out, the ongoing conflict is devastating the lives of hundreds of thousands of children in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo. The scale of rape and sexual violence involving children, as documented by UNICEF, is shocking. The situation is aggravated by the offensive carried out by the M23 since January, with the support and participation of Rwandan Defense Forces. The hostilities must cease in order to put an end to violations of international humanitarian law and of human rights, as well as summary executions of children, their recruitment by armed groups, systematic sexual violence, and all other serious violations of children’s rights, which must not go unpunished.
Secondly, as outlined in the resolution 2773, the conclusion of a ceasefire is imperative.
Despite numerous efforts, fighting continues, fueling the risk of regional expansion of the conflict. The communities of Southern and Eastern Africa reminded the need for a ceasefire in a joint call on February 8. The Security Council unanimously reaffirmed that in Resolution 2773. The Congolese and Rwandan presidents have declared their commitment to it in Doha last month. We must not wait any longer. Once concluded, the ceasefire must be monitored through a credible verification mechanism. MONUSCO must be prepared to play a role here. We also continue to call on Rwanda to end the illegal presence of its armed forces on the territory of another sovereign State in violation of its territorial integrity and in defiance of the resolutions of this Council.
Thirdly, given the urgency of the situation, France supports dialogue initiatives.
In particular, France supports regional mediation efforts provided by the African Union, the East African Community and the Southern African Development Community. These organizations have a key role to play in contributing to a cessation of hostilities, to a de-escalation of the crisis, and to finding a political solution through the harmonised Luanda and Nairobi processes. The appointment of the President of the Republic of Togo, Mr. Faure Gnassingbé, as the new African Union mediator must continue the momentum initiated by President Joao Lourenço, whose efforts France commends. We must implement the agreed parameters for an immediate and definitive withdrawal of Rwandan defense forces from Congolese territory and the demobilization of the FDLR by the Democratic Republic of the Congo. We believe that civil society dialogue initiatives are paramount, such as the one provided by the Conférence épiscopale nationale du Congo and the Eglise du Christ du Congo for a social pact for peace in the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Great Lakes region. Finally, France actively supports the work of the Special Envoy to promote regional cooperation, including with regards to the traceability of natural resources.
Fourthly, the convergence of all efforts is needed.
We must support all these efforts so that we can ensure a lasting political resolution as soon as possible. Last week, France as president of the Council, organized informal discussions with Angola, Kenya, Zimbabwe, Qatar and the United Nations to work towards aligning and coordinating this initiatives. We must act to ensure an effective ceasefire, the opening of humanitarian corridors, as well as the re-opening of the Goma airport and the full implementation of Resolution 2773.
There is no military solution to the conflict in the Great Lakes region. Negotiations must be concluded in order to end this crisis and work towards peace and shared prosperity in the region.
The Council must remain actively involved to create conditions conducive to that end. We must be prepared to shoulder our responsabilites in the absence of progress.
Thank you.

"Bird Secures Over $650 Million in New Awards; Reinforces Defence, Clean Energy and Healthcare Portfolios | The Manila Times","MISSISSAUGA, Ontario, April 16, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bird Construction Inc. (TSX: BDT) is pleased to announce that it has been awarded five projects with a combined value of over $650 million across its infrastructure, industrial and buildings businesses.
Defence Construction Canada has awarded Bird a modified design-build contract to design and construct 200 new residential housing units in Ontario. Managed by the Canadian Forces Housing Agency, this project is part of the Residential Portfolio Capital Investment Plan initiative that aims to provide suitable housing solutions for Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) members and their families. It is also part of a broader $1.4 billion investment over 20 years to enhance housing for CAF members while alleviating local housing demands.
Bird was selected for a new contract award as part of Dow's Path2Zero Program in Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta to build the world's first net zero integrated ethylene cracker and derivatives site with respect to scope 1 and 2 emissions. This new contract falls under the Utilities & Power Infrastructure group within the hydrocarbon production area and supports Dow's commitment to sustainable and low-emission operations. Bird's scope of work includes civil, mechanical, structural, piping, electrical and instrumentation, buildings and insulation works.
Bird was awarded a construction management contract for the multi-phase expansion and renovation of the Cottonwoods long-term care (LTC) facility in Kelowna, B.C. The initial phase of the project involves constructing a new four-storey, 234-bed LTC facility on the existing site, including all LTC support services and an operations centre for managing facilities across seven Interior Health locations. Phase 2 will involve demolishing the 1975 portion of the site and constructing a new one-storey mass timber amenity space, linking the new building with the remaining 1985 structure. This project will significantly modernize the existing facility, providing substantial benefits to the Kelowna community.
Further to the recently announced projects to support Ontario Power Generation's (OPG) nuclear work program, Bird, through Indigenous-led joint venture Makhos Bird Joint Venture (MBJV), was awarded additional contracts for the design and construction of four projects that will support ongoing nuclear operations and refurbishment activities.",2025-04-17T00:18:00.000+03:00,https://www.manilatimes.net/2025/04/17/tmt-newswire/globenewswire/bird-secures-over-650-million-in-new-awards-reinforces-defence-clean-energy-and-healthcare-portfolios/2093959,GlobeNewswire,positive
Gold price soars to fresh record high as trade tensions sink US Dollar,"- Gold hits third record high this week as trade war escalates; Trump targets rare earth imports from China.
- DXY drops 0.83% to 99.17, boosting gold as investors seek safety amid global economic uncertainty.
- Powell says Fed must stay vigilant on inflation, lowering rate cut hopes; focus shifts to jobless claims, housing data.
Gold price extended its record streak for the third time in the week as the Greenback weakened due to tensions between China and the US related to trade policies. These tensions are increasing the appeal of safe-haven assets like precious metals. At the time of writing, XAU/USD trades at $3,342, up more than 3.50%.
The trade-war escalation turned sentiment sour as the US President Donald Trump ordered an investigation to apply tariffs on rare earth imports, escalating the dispute with China.
Bullion hit record highs on Monday and Wednesday, with the all-time high (ATH) reaching $3,343. Meanwhile, the US Dollar Index (DXY), which tracks the buck's performance against a basket of six currencies, dropped 0.83% to 99.17.
In the meantime, Fed Chair Powell shattered rate cut expectations by stressing that the central bank must ensure tariffs don’t trigger a more persistent rise in inflation.
“Our obligation is to keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored and to make certain that a one-time increase in the price level does not become an ongoing inflation problem,” Powell said at the Economic Club of Chicago.
Data-wise, US Retail Sales exceeded projections, compared to the previous reading. US Industrial Production hinted that manufacturing activity continued to slow down,

Daily digest market movers: Gold price capitalizes gains on falling US yields
- The US 10-year Treasury yield tumbled almost six basis points to 4.281%. US real yields fell three and a half bps to 2.111%, as shown by the US 10-year Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities yields failing to cap Gold prices.
- Fed Chair Powell revealed that a weakening economy and high inflation could conflict with the central bank's two goals, making a stagflationary scenario possible.
- “We may find ourselves in the challenging scenario in which our dual-mandate goals are in tension,” he said. “If that were to occur, we would consider how far the economy is from each goal, and the potentially different time horizons over which those respective gaps would be anticipated to close.”
- Money market players had priced in 91 bps of easing by the Fed toward the end of 2025. The first cut is expected in July.
- Data-wise, US Retail Sales rose 1.4% MoM in March, beating the 1.3% forecast and surging from February’s 0.2%, boosted by strong auto sales. However, the control group—used for GDP calculations—rose just 0.4%, down from 1.3% and missing the 0.6% estimate.
- The Federal Reserve announced that Industrial Production fell 0.3% in March, following a 0.8% increase in February.
- XAU/USD technical outlook: Gold price poised to test new record highs at $3,400
Gold price uptrend remains in place with buyers eyeing the $3,350 figure. A breach of the latter will expose the $3,400 figure, followed by key psychological levels like $3,450 and $3,500.
Conversely if XAU/USD falls below $3,300, the first support would be the April 16 low of $3,229, followed by the $3,200 figure.
Gold FAQs
Gold has played a key role in human’s history as it has been widely used as a store of value and medium of exchange. Currently, apart from its shine and usage for jewelry, the precious metal is widely seen as a safe-haven asset, meaning that it is considered a good investment during turbulent times. Gold is also widely seen as a hedge against inflation and against depreciating currencies as it doesn’t rely on any specific issuer or government.
Central banks are the biggest Gold holders. In their aim to support their currencies in turbulent times, central banks tend to diversify their reserves and buy Gold to improve the perceived strength of the economy and the currency. High Gold reserves can be a source of trust for a country’s solvency. Central banks added 1,136 tonnes of Gold worth around $70 billion to their reserves in 2022, according to data from the World Gold Council. This is the highest yearly purchase since records began. Central banks from emerging economies such as China, India and Turkey are quickly increasing their Gold reserves.
Gold has an inverse correlation with the US Dollar and US Treasuries, which are both major reserve and safe-haven assets. When the Dollar depreciates, Gold tends to rise, enabling investors and central banks to diversify their assets in turbulent times. Gold is also inversely correlated with risk assets. A rally in the stock market tends to weaken Gold price, while sell-offs in riskier markets tend to favor the precious metal.
The price can move due to a wide range of factors. Geopolitical instability or fears of a deep recession can quickly make Gold price escalate due to its safe-haven status. As a yield-less asset, Gold tends to rise with lower interest rates, while higher cost of money usually weighs down on the yellow metal. Still, most moves depend on how the US Dollar (USD) behaves as the asset is priced in dollars (XAU/USD). A strong Dollar tends to keep the price of Gold controlled, whereas a weaker Dollar is likely to push Gold prices up.

Exclusive: Thousands Urge CO Lawmakers to Reject Radical Trans Bill,"Thousands of Coloradans are reaching out to state lawmakers urging them to vote against a radical transgender bill that would classify “misgendering” and “deadnaming” as forms of child abuse that would be considered in child custody disputes.
By Tuesday, 6,161 Coloradans sent 215,475 emails to Colorado state senators through Heritage Action for America’s Colorado Action Center, Breitbart News exclusively learned. Heritage Action started the Colorado Action Center on April 8 in response to HB25-1312 , which passed the state House on April 6 and is currently waiting to be assigned to a Senate committee.
“Heritage Action and our army of grassroots conservatives in Colorado strongly oppose this legislation, which seeks to impose radical gender ideology on families,” Heritage Action Vice President Janae Stracke told Breitbart News in a statement. “This tidal wave of opposition against this legislation in Colorado highlights how disconnected radical Democrats are from their constituents. This bill is an open assault on parents’ rights and free speech. We urge all Colorado lawmakers to reject this legislation.”
The bill subscribes to the false idea that one can identify as or become a different sex than they were born as, often called “gender identity.” The bill defines “deadname” as: “to purposefully, and with the intent to disregard the individual’s gender identity or gender expression, refer to an individual by their birth name rather than their chosen name.” The bill defines “misgender” as: “to purposefully, and with the intent to disregard the individual’s gender identity or gender expression, refer to an individual using an honorific or pronoun that conflicts with the individual’s gender identity or gender expression.”
According to the bill’s summary , the legislation would direct courts making child custody decisions and determining the best interests of a child “for purposes of parenting time” to consider “deadnaming,” “misgendering,” or threatening to publish material related to an individual’s sex change services as types of “coercive control.”
The bill would additionally define “deadnaming” and “misgendering” as discriminatory acts in the “Colorado Anti-Discrimination Act,” which would essentially prohibit calling sex-confused individuals by their real names or biological sex in places of public accommodation.
The bill would further prohibit Colorado courts from complying with orders or laws from other states mandating that a child be taken from parents or caregivers who allow them access to mutilating sex change drugs and surgeries — which transgender activists euphemistically call “gender-affirming care.”
The legislation would direct schools that establish policies related to “chosen names” to include all reasons why a student may choose to go by a name other than their legal name. Schools would also be barred from including rules based on “gender” in dress code policies.
The bill also directs public entities that require individuals to disclose their names to have options for both legal and chosen names. The public entity would be required to use a chosen name on all subsequent forms if it differs from the individual’s legal name.
The bill is officially called the “The Kelly Loving Act,” named after a transgender-identifying man who was killed during the 2022 Club Q shooting in Colorado Springs, according to Colorado Newsline.
Democrats hold a trifecta in Colorado: they dominate the state House 43-22, the state Senate 23-12, and they hold the governorship with Gov. Jared Polis (D).
Democrats in the House denied all proposed Republican amendments to the bill and were able to use procedural rules to stymie and ultimately halt debate on the bill before passing it on a Sunday.
Democrats behind the bill have criticized parental rights groups concerned about the transgender bills, with one even comparing them to the Ku Klux Klan. Democrat state Rep. Yara Zokaie said, “A well-stakeholded bill does not need to be discussed with hate groups, and we don’t ask someone passing civil rights legislation to go ask the KKK their opinion.”
According to Heritage Action, “ radical gender ideology activists have been working to weaponize Child Protective Services (CPS) against US parents by accusing them of ‘abuse’ if they do not affirm and recognize their child’s ‘gender identity.”‘
“Multiple states have already passed legislation to criminalize parents through this perverse redefinition of abuse, allowing for the removal of children from the loving homes of ‘non-affirming parents,'” the organization noted.
Heritage Action says the bill would deny parental rights, violate free speech, harm vulnerable children, and “mandate schools prioritize indoctrination over education.”
“The ONLY time a state should ever remove a child is for actual abuse, not to impose a destructive ideology. The truth is simple. It is never abuse to raise a girl as a girl or a boy as a boy,” the organization says on its Colorado Action Center page.
“It is imperative that all Colorado senators hear from their constituents on how this radical bill will tear apart families and harm children across Colorado,” the organization added.

"中马携手共建""一带一路""成果丰硕 _ 东方财富网","位于马来西亚彭亨州的马中关丹产业园。新华社记者程一恒摄
　　12年来，中马共建“ 一带一路 ”合作取得丰硕成果，基础设施建设不断升级、贸易规模持续扩大、新兴领域合作方兴未艾，成为区域经济一体化和中国—东盟共建“ 一带一路 ”的典范。展望未来，中国将与马来西亚一道，将高质量共建“ 一带一路 ”推向新高度，为全球南方国家团结合作、共同发展注入正能量。
　　马来西亚是古代海上丝绸之路沿线重要国家，也是最早响应共建“一带一路”倡议的国家之一，更是共建“一带一路”早期收获最丰硕的国家之一。2013年以来，共建“一带一路”倡议同马来西亚“昌明经济”框架等深度对接，中马合作取得丰硕成果，成为区域经济一体化和中国—东盟共建“一带一路”的典范。
　　 务实合作持续提质升级
　　当前经济全球化遭遇空前“回头浪”，极限施压和关税讹诈严重扰乱全球贸易秩序，让全球产业链供应链面临断供断链风险，中马共建“一带一路”在逆境中展现出强大活力，为变乱交织的世界注入稳定剂，推动打造更紧密的中国—东盟命运共同体。
　　基础设施建设不断升级。比如，由中交马东铁项目公司承建的马来西亚东海岸铁路作为中马高质量共建“一带一路”旗舰项目，全长约665公里，计划2027年底竣工，将打通关丹港和巴生港，构建起连接马来西亚东西海岸的重要“陆上桥梁”，填补马来半岛东西岸没有铁路贯通的空白，提升货物运输效率。今年1月，马东铁项目正线A、B段轨道铺通，标志着项目取得重要阶段性进展。
　　贸易规模持续扩大。中国已连续16年成为马来西亚最大贸易伙伴，而马来西亚则是中国在东盟成员国中的第二大贸易伙伴和最大进口来源国。2024年，中马双边贸易额达到2120亿美元，比两国建交时增长近千倍。中马贸易结构互补性强，中国自马进口计算机零部件、棕榈油和 塑料制品 等，对马出口服装和纺织品等。
　　“两国双园”合作不断深入。马中关丹产业园和中马钦州产业园区树立了“两国双园”模式下双边经济合作的创新典范。马中关丹产业园依托两国自然禀赋、产业优势和市场资源，园区产业体系加速构筑，已成为马来西亚东海岸经济特区最成功的工业园区之一。随着扩建工程全面完成，关丹港吞吐量预计将翻番，从2600万吨增至5200万吨，马中关丹产业园升级扩园与新项目建设将进一步促进共建“一带一路”沿线货物流动和贸易发展。
　　 新兴领域合作方兴未艾
　　随着全球供应链加速重构，中马积极探索共建“一带一路”更深层次的产业链合作。在电子产品和机械制造领域，中马企业形成了产业链“垂直分工”的模式。这种合作模式不仅提高了两国产业链的效率，还带动了相关技术的进步。更重要的是，它增强了中马两国在全球供应链中的竞争力。随着两国产业园区的进一步发展，这种跨境供应链合作将持续拓展到 新能源 和 人工智能 等更多领域。
　　此外，随着中马“绿色丝绸之路”合作不断深入，合作领域也不断拓宽。中国企业在沙巴州建设的地面光伏项目已经上网发电，在吉打州南部的瓜拉基蒂光伏电站商业运行顺利。在制造业领域，中资企业也成为马来西亚光伏行业发展的重要推动力量，有力促进了当地光伏全产业链发展。在 新能源 汽车领域，马来西亚宝腾汽车与中国吉利控股集团的合资合作，提升了宝腾的生产效率并恢复了其在马来西亚的销售，吉利计划投资100亿美元建设汽车枢纽，预计将吸引更多高质量的电动汽车及零部件投资，提升马来西亚在全球汽车和相关技术领域的地位。
　　围绕“数字丝绸之路”，中马在 人工智能 、丝路电商、 智慧物流 等领域合作取得了长足进步，助力马来西亚建设成为区域 数字经济 领导者。目前，在中国企业的支持下，马来西亚“数智港口”“绿色智慧电厂”“数智供应链”等项目正在不断落实。
　　 构建更紧密的命运共同体
　　中马共建“一带一路”走过12年光辉历程，如今又一次站在了新征程起点上。2025年，马来西亚正式成为金砖伙伴国，同时担任东盟轮值主席国和中国—东盟关系协调国。中国将与马来西亚一道，将高质量共建“一带一路”推向新高度，推动构建更为紧密的中国—东盟命运共同体。
　　加快中国—东盟自贸区3.0版落地。2024年，中国与东盟十国领导人宣布实质性结束中国—东盟自贸区3.0版谈判，马来西亚发挥2025年东盟轮值主席国作用，积极推动中国—东盟自贸区3.0版落实落地，共同反对贸易保护主义。全面深化《区域全面经济伙伴关系协定》（RCEP），有力带动中马共建“一带一路”高质量发展再上新高度，全面拓展新兴领域互利合作，加强标准和规制领域互融互通，促进贸易便利化及包容发展，为中马合作注入新动能，开辟新路径。
　　统筹推进重大标志性工程和“小而美”民生项目。在共建“一带一路”合作框架下，中马加快建成马东铁标志性工程，进一步提升东盟立体互联互通网络。同时，打造更多中马共建“一带一路”“小而美”民生项目，深化中马农业领域合作，在种植、贸易合作基础上，针对市场需求发挥各自优势，进一步开展农业技术、农业设备、农业基础设施建设、 农产品 深加工等方面合作，将中马双赢的“榴莲经济学”推广到更多农业合作领域。
　　通过合作建设皇京港和升级关丹港，有效提升马来西亚航运货运量，进一步释放中国与马来西亚参与地区产业链分工和国际贸易的潜能，对冲贸易保护主义的不确定性，维护中国—东盟产业链供应链稳定。对于双方相互间出口规模较大的产品，进一步优化和加强产业链垂直分工合作，用好两国产业园区，优化跨境供应链，加快推动中马、中国—东盟市场多元整合，为各自发挥优势创造更加有利条件。在稳定供应链、产业链的基础上构建东盟区域价值链，构建区域内多梯度、强互补的产业网络，实现产业链与全球生产体系对接融合，摆脱全球产业价值链“低端锁定”风险，共同推进中马乃至中国—东盟产品向全球价值链高端攀升。
　　当前，全球局势变乱交织，逆全球化、保护主义行为冲击中国周边和国际经贸体系秩序。但逆流并非主流，中国与马来西亚携手合作，以高质量共建“一带一路”为主要平台，将让古老的海上丝绸之路焕发新的生机，为中国同周边国家开辟友好合作新境界，为全球南方国家团结合作、共同发展注入正能量。

把发展经济着力点放在实体经济上 _ 东方财富网,"习近平总书记高度重视实体经济发展，这在《习近平经济文选》第一卷的多篇著作中都有体现。习近平总书记在《着力振兴实体经济》中指出，“不论经济发展到什么时候，实体经济都是我国经济发展、我们在国际经济竞争中赢得主动的根基”；在党的十九大报告中提出，“必须把发展经济的着力点放在实体经济上”；在党的二十大报告中强调，“坚持把发展经济的着力点放在实体经济上，推进 新型工业化 ，加快建设制造强国、质量强国、航天强国、交通强国、网络强国、数字中国”。这些重要论述为构筑中国式现代化的强大物质技术基础指明了方向，具有重大的理论和实践意义，我们要深入学习领会。
　　进入新时代，我国经济已由高速增长阶段转向高质量发展阶段。推动经济高质量发展，必须坚持深化供给侧结构性改革和着力扩大有效需求协同发力，统筹好总供给和总需求的关系，在更高水平上实现供求关系新的动态均衡。习近平总书记在2016年中央经济工作会议上深刻分析了我国经济运行面临的突出矛盾和问题，指出实体经济结构性供需失衡、金融和实体经济失衡、房地产和实体经济失衡这“三大失衡”，强调“振兴实体经济是供给侧结构性改革的主要任务，供给侧结构性改革要向振兴实体经济发力、聚力”。一方面，要抓好全面提高产品和服务质量这个提升供给体系的中心任务，用好创新这个实体产业发展的制胜法宝，利用好国际国内两个市场、两种资源，重视优化产业组织。另一方面，要处理好金融和实体经济的关系，全面提高金融为实体经济服务的效率和水平。习近平总书记在《服务实体经济，防范金融风险》中强调，“实体经济是金融的根基，金融是实体经济的血脉，为实体经济服务是金融的天职，是金融的宗旨”。要优化融资结构体系，打造适应实体经济发展的金融链，决不能脱实向虚。
　　把制造业高质量发展放到更加突出的位置。制造业是立国之本、强国之基，是实体经济的重要组成部分，也是现代科技创新的核心产业载体。制造业高质量发展是我国经济高质量发展的重中之重。新时代新征程，以中国式现代化全面推进强国建设、民族复兴伟业，实现 新型工业化 是关键任务。这就必须推进制造业高质量发展，实现我国从制造大国向制造强国转变。习近平总书记在《推动制造业高质量发展》中提出，“党中央对提升制造业质量和关键核心技术创新能力作了部署，要咬定青山不放松，切实抓好落实”。需着力提升制造业创新能力，以智能制造和绿色制造为主攻方向，加快发展先进制造业，持续推动制造业向高端化、智能化、绿色化、融合化方向优化升级，提升产业基础能力和产业链现代化水平，全面打造自主可控、安全可靠的产业链供应链。
　　建设以实体经济为支撑的现代化产业体系。党的二十大擘画了全面建成社会主义现代化强国的宏伟蓝图，到2035年要建成现代化经济体系。必须把发展经济的着力点放在实体经济上，把提高供给体系质量作为主攻方向，加快建设以实体经济为支撑的现代化产业体系，为培育和发展新质生产力提供载体。要实现实体经济、科技创新、现代金融、人力资源协同发展，促进科技创新与产业创新深度融合，促进 数字经济 和实体经济深度融合，促进现代服务业同先进制造业、现代农业深度融合，改造提升传统产业，培育壮大新兴产业，布局建设未来产业，构建现代化基础设施体系，提升产业体系完整性、先进性、安全性水平。

放宽店铺外摆凸显城市治理温度 _ 东方财富网,"编辑部：
　　记者最近在地方采访时发现，一些城市临街商铺开展外摆经营的情况明显增多。日前，以杭州为代表的浙江多个城市放宽店铺外摆政策，因地制宜支持商贸经营主体利用自有场地外摆促销，支持临街商铺开展外摆经营，并协调解决外摆集中区停车难问题。这些举措凸显城市治理的温度与精度，让“烟火气”升腾、市集更热闹，进一步激活了消费市场。
　　记者注意到，浙江放宽外摆，并非“ 地摊经济 ”的低层次回归，而是对新经济形态融入城市肌理的一种探索实践。以杭州传统街区吴山广场为例，“外摆新政”实施后，吴山广场附近街区实现迭代升级，许多充满数字科技、市井烟火气、沉浸式文旅及原创品牌的新潮店铺落地。走在石板路上，人们吃着带有麦香与炭火气息的路边摊，欣赏AR技术投影出的宋韵水墨画。“烟火气”与“潮生活”交织，市民和外地游客纷纷前来“打卡”。对于商业外摆，浙江提供精准政策支持，激发商家们“摆”出新意、“摆”对内容，形成独特的消费场景，为放大线下消费开辟了新路径。
　　当然，放宽店铺外摆，不应是刺激消费的“急就章”，不能简单停留在放开或放宽的层次上，还要有长远谋划。比如，可针对城市文化禀赋和特色景观，充分利用外摆区空间搭建星空棚、露营区等，打造以地方美食、民生夜市等为主题的品牌集市，充分营造体验式消费氛围，不断推动各类商圈提颜值、聚人气、添活力。
　　放宽店铺外摆，具有重要的经济价值。城市公共空间不仅具有物理属性，更是经济活动的重要载体。对于商铺经营者来说，放宽外摆后，可联动室内室外经营空间，通过延长消费者停留时间、增强场景体验感等，创造出“空间溢价”。从资源配置角度看，通过“潮汐型”“便民型”摊位设置，可实现公共空间的时间维度再分配，盘活闲置空间资源，实现效益最大化。
　　放宽店铺外摆，考验治理智慧。此前，一些地方的监管过于严苛，对摆摊设点“光踩刹车”“只设路障”；一些地方又过于宽松、听之任之，最终影响城市形象。如何跳出“一管就死，一放就乱”的怪圈？治理理念的转变是关键。只有打破传统“以罚代管”模式，将治理重心从“禁止外摆”转向“规范引导”，将外摆审批权限下放，使审批效率和商户合规经营率同步提升，实现从“堵”到“疏”的转变。当前，不少城市管理部门积极推进“首违不罚”，实施包容审慎监管，构建法治营商暖环境。在柔性执法中包容审慎，在包容审慎中柔性执法，才能更好实现城市市容和市场繁荣相兼容。

chevron-right,"SPRINGFIELD, Ill (WICS) — New legislation could ban the use of harmful chemicals in firefighter gear.
Firefighters said while they're braving dangerous conditions...
Having safe equipment means one less thing to worry about.
You might've heard the term PFAS before--also called forever chemicals. Studies said they could increase cancer risk.
""PFAS, or forever chemicals, were actually abundant in our bunker gear--and by bunker gear I mean the coat, the pants, the boots, the gloves, the helmet, that we wear every day,” Chuck Sullivan said.
President of Associated Fire Fighters of Illinois Chuck Sullivan said the same equipment meant to keep firefighters safe, could be making them sick.
""The leading cause of death for firefighters today is cancer. It's not heart disease, it's not stroke, it's not building collapse, it's not burn injuries. It's cancer. And it's literally killing us,” Sullivan said.
Jim Keiken, the director of Illinois Fire Service Institute, says PFAS have been linked with thyroid disease, reproductive problems--and cancer.
But he said the jury's still out on if forever chemicals are to blame for a high cancer incidence among firefighters.
""As a firefighter, am I exposed from the A-triple-F like the commercial says, is it because my turnout gear is on my body and I'm hot and sweaty, or is it being released in the fire that I'm going in to extinguish?” Keiken said.
Keiken said the Illinois Fire Service Institute is currently launching a 30-year study to break down the potential causes of high cancer incidence among firefighters. Through that study, they're also travelling across Illinois to reach volunteer firefighters and smaller departments.
Some fire stations, like the Springfield Fire Department, are already making the switch to pfas-free gear.
""We have close to 75 sets of PFAS-free gear for the 200 members on the job. Over the next couple--two years--we should probably be at the point where most of the department has PFAS free gear. We don't want our firefighters to have to worry about getting cancer,” Fire Chief Ed Canny with the Springfield Fire Department said.
Sullivan said braving dangerous conditions are part of a firefighter's oath...
""We understand the risks of firefighting. We understand we're going to, on a daily basis, encounter carcinogenic and toxic chemicals. That's just the nature of our job. Completely understand that, and accept that. But when our bunker gear actually contains PFAS, we have an issue with that,” Sullivan said.
PFAS are water and oil resistant, making them a common component of firefighting gear.
One study said PFAS-free equipment isn't as effective as its predecessor at repelling oil.
Which could present a danger to firefighters.
But at the Illinois Fire Service Institute, the gear will go through rigorous training.
""Our instructors are going to put that turnout gear through maybe 5-10 years of wear in the next year because of the amount of training that we do with it,” Keiken, director of the IFSI said.
Keiken said so far the results are promising...
Keiken said dependent on the next year, firefighters will have a better idea of how effective the new gear is.
Right now, PFAS-free gear does cost firefighters more money.
PFAS-free gear does meet regulatory standards. Some fire departments, including Springfield, have already made the switch to PFAS-free equipment.
The new legislation would require companies to stop selling gear containing forever chemicals by January 1, 2027.
The Illinois House passed the bill unanimously...and its next stop is the Senate floor.",2025-04-17T01:12:00.000+03:00,https://foxillinois.com/news/local/new-legislation-could-ban-use-of-pfas-in-firefighting-gear,Emily Jordan,positive

Deputado propõe inclusão da Bíblia nas escolas pernambucanas,"Deputado estadual propõe inclusão da Bíblia como livro paradidático nas escolas pernambucanas
Projeto de Lei foi apresentado pelo parlamentar Júnior Tércio (PP)

Nesta quarta-feira (16), o deputado estadual Pastor Júnior Tércio (PP) apresentou um Projeto de Lei Ordinária à Assembleia Legislativa de Pernambuco (Alepe). O documento propõe a inclusão da Bíblia Sagrada como livro paradidático nas instituições públicas e privadas de ensino do estado.
Para justificar o projeto, Tércio, que também atua como líder religioso na “Assembleia de Deus Novas de Paz”, afirmou que os ensinamentos bíblicos podem contribuir com a sociedade, e que os contos religiosos ajudarão os alunos nas disciplinas de história, literatura, ensino religioso, artes, filosofia e outras atividades pedagógicas.
No texto, o deputado descreveu a obra cristã como um “livro histórico com descrições precisas de um tempo longínquo”, que possui escrituras detalhadas sobre “a história do povo de Israel”. Além disso, há também citações de versículos bíblicos, que de acordo com o parlamentar, se alinham à “necessidade da preservação da inocência das crianças” e ao “o exercício do perdão e o amor ao próximo”.
“A Bíblia Sagrada é também um livro rico em história, cultura, filosofia e arqueologia e ensinamentos de muito valor, razão pela qual será muito proveitoso que nossas crianças tenham contato com esse tipo de conteúdo, caso seus responsáveis legais achem que seja pertinente”, destacou Júnior Tércio .
Como seria o funcionamento da nova Lei?
Na proposta, para dar seguimento à lei, o deputado enfatizou que o governo estadual deverá arcar com todos os custos da arrecadação e distribuição dos livros, bem como estabelecer critérios, diretrizes e estratégias para leitura da obra. De acordo com o parlamentar, em garantia aos direitos de liberdade religiosa presentes na Constituição Federal, não haveria obrigatoriedade na participação de atividades que envolvessem o uso da Bíblia.
Renato Antunes (PL), também deputado estadual e presidente da comissão de Educação, Cultura, Esporte e Lazer da Alepe, afirmou que a proposição será analisada pelo colegiado, e que o respeito pela laicidade do estado será sempre mantido. O PL ainda deverá passar pela comissão de Constituição, Legislação e Justiça (CCLJ) da Assembleia para então seguir para a Comissão de Educação, plenário, e para a sanção da chefe estadual, em caso de aprovação.

Guilfoyle-Mania Sweeps Greece: Hellenic Republic Ready for Kim,"ATHENS, Greece — Kimberly Guilfoyle is already a sensation in Greece, and she has not even had her U.S. Senate confirmation hearing yet.
The top ally of President Donald Trump, who the president nominated as his U.S. Ambassador to Greece, is eagerly awaited here in the Hellenic Republic. Leaders from the Prime Minister on down through his top officials throughout government to cultural, business, and political leaders throughout the nation are excited to have such a high profile ambassador coming as soon as she is confirmed by the U.S. Senate.
“We are looking forward to having her confirmed,” Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis told Breitbart News in his office at Maximos Mansion here in Athens last week. “I am looking forward to meeting her as soon as she comes to Greece. I think she will find that Greek-American relations are at an all-time high, so she is essentially coming at a time when we have a very strong relationship which we can further improve.”
Greek Health Minister Adonis Georgiadis, who also serves as one of the two Vice Presidents of Greece’s governing party New Democracy, echoed that sentiment, saying he is excited for Guilfoyle’s arrival. He noted Guilfoyle’s close relationship with the president and her ability to be able to get to him directly.
“I haven’t met her yet. But I have to say the first things I’ve seen were excellent,” Georgiadis told Breitbart News in an interview in his office. “The speech she gave in the White House during our national day ceremony was an excellent speech and as I understand she is really thrilled with coming to Greece. This is a very good sign. And on the other hand, I think the decision of President Trump to have her in Greece—to have someone really close to him—it’s a sign that he gives real importance to Greece. We will have an ambassador that if we need it, she will be able to talk to him directly. This is important.”
The Archbishop of the Church of Greece, Ieronymos II of Athens, told Breitbart News he is excited she is coming too.
“We’re looking forward to her arrival, and I will let her know many key steps that must be taken in the right direction, slowly but surely,” Ieronymos II said in an interview. “Having lived almost ninw decades and having spent time in Europe, I’ve developed a global perspective, including on Greece. Greeks are people of filotimo, honorable, hardworking, respectful people. But they also carry a certain fear, because they’ve endured so many difficulties throughout the years. So I was pleased to hear about her appointment. I already talked with her through the phone and we are ready to welcome her in Greece. I think she has the potential to become an effective Ambassador that will bring our two great nations even closer.”
Guilfoyle, until she is Senate confirmed, is unable to communicate directly with the government in Greece. But it’s abundantly clear after Breitbart News spent all of last week in Greece—here in Athens for the first couple days, then up in Delphi for the remainder of the week at the Delphi Economic Forum—that across the board government officials are excited she’s coming. This journalist did several television and news media interviews with Greek media outlets all week last week and even some this week, and without fail, every single one of the reporters asks about Guilfoyle and what she’s like as a person and what Greeks should expect from the eventual U.S. ambassador.
Christos Marafatsos, who has since before Trump’s 2016 victory run the U.S.-based organization Greeks for Trump, ran into Breitbart News in Delphi later in the week and recalled how his first-ever interview way back in the lead-up to the 2016 election was with Breitbart News. Asked about the energy surrounding eventual U.S. Ambassador Guilfoyle, Marafatsos told Breitbart News that Greeks are rightly excited about it all.
“Greeks and Greek Americans are absolutely thrilled that Kimberly Guilfoyle will be representing the United States in Greece — she’s smart, fearless, and loves our country,” Marafatsos told Breitbart News. “Her presence sends a powerful message: under President Trump, America stands strong with Greece. Big things are coming!”
The biggest question Breitbart News would get when asked by locals about Guilfoyle is: What’s taking so long and how long until she gets here? Well, as the birthplace of democracy would probably well know, sometimes democracy takes some time to play out—and the Democrats in the U.S. Senate back in the states are slow-walking many of Trump’s nominees, despite requisite support among the GOP majority in the Senate. Nonetheless, it’s expected that Guilfoyle will probably have a confirmation hearing before the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee later in the spring or early summer and be confirmed by the full U.S. Senate shortly thereafter.",2025-04-17T01:40:00.000+03:00,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/04/16/exclusive-guilfoyle-mania-sweeps-greece-hellenic-republic-ready-for-kimberly-as-u-s-ambassador,Matthew Boyle,positive
Letter to French Embassy demands Haitian reparations - Trinidad and Tobago Newsday,"A letter demanding France pay reparations and restitution to embattled Haiti will be delivered to the French Embassy at its Mary Street, Port of Spain, office on April 17 at 10 am.
This is a part of a wider campaign by the regional executive committee of The Assembly of Caribbean People of which politician David Abdulah is a part.
At a virtual media conference on April 15, Abdulah and other members, including Haitian economist Prof Camille Chalmers, spoke about why the committee was demanding reparations and other action planned.
The letter is also being delivered on the 200th anniversary of France demanding Haiti compensate it for winning its independence in 1804. Haiti was ordered to pay 150 million francs and it took the country more than 120 years to do so. Abdulah said other groups were expected to join the committee’s visit to the embassy and called on anyone else interested in supporting to do so.
Haiti’s gang problem and Kenyan troops helping in that fight were also discussed. One participating member called for the Kenyan troops’ removal.
On April 13, Caricom issued a statement saying it was deeply concerned by recent reports that a coalition of criminal gangs was threatening to seize power and compel a change in the governance arrangements in Haiti.
“This is completely unacceptable,” Caricom said.
It added that it strongly condemned any attempt to replace the transitional arrangements by force and violence.
“These arrangements were put in place by Haitian stakeholders to pave the way for free and fair elections by February 7, 2026, and to return Haiti to constitutional authority.
Moreover, any further organised violence will only exacerbate the existing humanitarian crisis. The International Organisation on Migration (IOM) reported that in mid-January of this year there were 1,041,000 internally displaced Haitians, some of whom are already risking their lives in attempting to leave by any means necessary. Over the last month alone, close to 60,000 Haitians have been displaced. Increased violence will simply hurt those who are least capable of protecting themselves.”
Caricom said it had been in consultation with Haiti and international partners to urgently provide further assistance. It saluted the effort of Haitian security forces and the Multinational Security Support (MSS) mission spearheaded by the Kenyans to enforce order and protect the citizens. It also called on the international community, including the UN and Organisation of American States to take “all necessary steps” to support Haitian authorities addressing this crisis.
It was reported on April 15 that the Haitian government had approved a war budget aimed at curbing escalating gang violence.",2025-04-17T01:24:00.000+03:00,https://newsday.co.tt/2025/04/16/letter-to-french-embassy-demands-haitian-reparations,Melissa Doughty,positive

放宽店铺外摆凸显城市治理温度,"分享到微信X

编辑部：
记者最近在地方采访时发现，一些城市临街商铺开展外摆经营的情况明显增多。日前，以杭州为代表的浙江多个城市放宽店铺外摆政策，因地制宜支持商贸经营主体利用自有场地外摆促销，支持临街商铺开展外摆经营，并协调解决外摆集中区停车难问题。这些举措凸显城市治理的温度与精度，让“烟火气”升腾、市集更热闹，进一步激活了消费市场。
记者注意到，浙江放宽外摆，并非“地摊经济”的低层次回归，而是对新经济形态融入城市肌理的一种探索实践。以杭州传统街区吴山广场为例，“外摆新政”实施后，吴山广场附近街区实现迭代升级，许多充满数字科技、市井烟火气、沉浸式文旅及原创品牌的新潮店铺落地。走在石板路上，人们吃着带有麦香与炭火气息的路边摊，欣赏AR技术投影出的宋韵水墨画。“烟火气”与“潮生活”交织，市民和外地游客纷纷前来“打卡”。对于商业外摆，浙江提供精准政策支持，激发商家们“摆”出新意、“摆”对内容，形成独特的消费场景，为放大线下消费开辟了新路径。
当然，放宽店铺外摆，不应是刺激消费的“急就章”，不能简单停留在放开或放宽的层次上，还要有长远谋划。比如，可针对城市文化禀赋和特色景观，充分利用外摆区空间搭建星空棚、露营区等，打造以地方美食、民生夜市等为主题的品牌集市，充分营造体验式消费氛围，不断推动各类商圈提颜值、聚人气、添活力。
放宽店铺外摆，具有重要的经济价值。城市公共空间不仅具有物理属性，更是经济活动的重要载体。对于商铺经营者来说，放宽外摆后，可联动室内室外经营空间，通过延长消费者停留时间、增强场景体验感等，创造出“空间溢价”。从资源配置角度看，通过“潮汐型”“便民型”摊位设置，可实现公共空间的时间维度再分配，盘活闲置空间资源，实现效益最大化。
放宽店铺外摆，考验治理智慧。此前，一些地方的监管过于严苛，对摆摊设点“光踩刹车”“只设路障”；一些地方又过于宽松、听之任之，最终影响城市形象。如何跳出“一管就死，一放就乱”的怪圈？治理理念的转变是关键。只有打破传统“以罚代管”模式，将治理重心从“禁止外摆”转向“规范引导”，将外摆审批权限下放，使审批效率和商户合规经营率同步提升，实现从“堵”到“疏”的转变。当前，不少城市管理部门积极推进“首违不罚”，实施包容审慎监管，构建法治营商暖环境。在柔性执法中包容审慎，在包容审慎中柔性执法，才能更好实现城市市容和市场繁荣相兼容。

30多年，届届广交会他都来
人民网－人民日报
“走，一起再去广交会。”
第137届广交会开幕前夕，马来西亚三江贸易有限公司负责人丁扬岗（Ting Youngkang）一边收拾自己的行李，一边电话联系马来西亚几大商超采购商伙伴，结伴预订了同一个航班前往广州。
“老丁，咱们有没有可能联手引进中国香薰企业到马来西亚生产？”电话里，采购商伙伴迫不及待咨询。兼任马来西亚中国总商会中央理事、国际商务委员会主席的丁扬岗，被亲切地称呼为“老丁”。
1986年，丁扬岗的父亲第一次参加广交会。“父亲说，那是一个琳琅满目、令人眼花缭乱的‘神奇世界’，各种商品应有尽有。”老丁说，父亲的描述让他对广州、对广交会有了天然的亲切感。
1990年，18岁的丁扬岗第一次跟着父亲参加广交会。从此，他便没有错过任何一次“广交会之约”。
“大家叫我‘广二代’。”老丁说，对这个外号，他引以为傲。
广交会，中国外贸的风向标，在老丁的心里不仅仅是寻找合作机遇的平台，还有着别样的意义。
“父亲和我，两代人的事业都与马中友谊紧紧连在一起。尽自己的力量，推动畅通这座桥梁，这是父亲的愿望，也是我义不容辞的责任。”老丁说。
得益于与中国企业长久合作，三江公司的业务从马来西亚向泰国、文莱、新加坡等地开拓，产品甚至销往印度洋群岛国家。与此同时，三江公司也推动中国合作伙伴在东南亚快速发展。
“一个展会，能够聚集3万家出口企业、20万名全球采购商，全面展示‘中国制造’整体竞争力，这就是广交会的魅力。”丁扬岗充分发挥马来西亚中国总商会的影响力，积极组织马来西亚采购商和供应商参加广交会。在总商会的组织和带动下，许多会员企业都从广交会中获益。
“有一届广交会，我发现一家上届参会的马来西亚企业没报名，便打电话询问情况，对方说‘不敢再参会了’，理由是上届广交会上接到的订单太多，还在努力赶工，不敢再接新订单了！”老丁说，这个故事不胫而走，广交会和中国市场的机遇更加深入人心，报名参加广交会的马来西亚企业倍增。
30多年过去了，丁扬岗从“小丁”变成了“老丁”，但促进马中经贸交流与合作的心态始终没变。
这次来广交会，老丁不仅要采购商品，还要了解马来西亚中国总商会会员企业的参展情况，了解当前国际贸易形势下马中两国进出口企业的现状和应对之策。“我要掌握一手信息，制订更好的计划，为促进马中经贸尽绵薄之力。”老丁说。
老丁告诉记者，“这届广交会，我们要重点看看汽车用品展位，包括汽车内饰、车载香薰等，这些产品在马来西亚市场需求很大，中国产品具有广阔的前景。”
透过广交会的窗口，老丁能深切感受到中国推动高水平对外开放的决心，“推进开放、扩大开放，中国一直说到做到。”
马来西亚企业与中国企业优势互补，双方经贸合作凸显了双边关系的韧性。“我坚信，两国企业一定能抓住机遇，深化合作，携手应对挑战，共同创造更美好的明天。”老丁说。

"资金持续""借基""加码A股 沪深300ETF规模再破万亿|沪深300_新浪财经_新浪网","证券时报记者 吴琦
昨日多只宽基 ETF 尾盘放量翻红，引发市场关注。多位市场人士表示，放量的ETF都曾受到“国家队”偏好，可能是“国家队”再次出手，为市场注入信心。
近期市场波动加大，资金持续借道ETF加码投资A股。Wind数据显示，自4月7日以来，已有超1700亿元资金净流入股票型ETF。截至4月15日，跟踪 沪深300指数 的24只ETF合计规模再破万亿元大关。
多只宽基ETF尾盘放量
4月16日尾盘，华泰柏瑞沪深300ETF、华夏上证50ETF、易方达沪深300ETF、华夏沪深300ETF和嘉实沪深300ETF等5只宽基ETF尾盘集体放量 拉升 ，收盘翻红，以上5只ETF合计成交额达到298.28亿元，较前一个交易日增加1.24倍。其中华泰柏瑞沪深300ETF成交额最高，超过83亿元，是上个交易日的2倍多。华夏上证50ETF成交额超过62亿元，也是上个交易日的2倍多。
类似的情况也发生在其他宽基ETF上，如南方中证500ETF、易方达创业板ETF、南方中证1000ETF等也明显放量。
多位市场人士表示，上述ETF都曾受到“国家队”偏好，可能是“国家队”再次出手，为市场注入信心。
自4月7日以来，宽基ETF成交额频频放量。盘后数据显示，大笔资金净流入沪深300、中证500等宽基ETF，为A股市场企稳提供“真金白银”的支持。
汇总来看，自4月7日以来，已有超1700亿元资金净流入股票型ETF。
从具体产品来看，华泰柏瑞沪深300ETF获资金净流入最高，区间内共计337.46亿元资金加码该ETF。华夏沪深300ETF、易方达沪深300ETF、南方中证500ETF、南方中证1000ETF、华夏上证50ETF等近期均获超百亿资金净流入。
值得注意的是，除了沪深300ETF外，中证1000ETF、中证500ETF、创业板ETF和科创板50ETF等宽基ETF亦受到大资金青睐，规模出现提升。可见，大资金增持ETF的力度不仅较大，增持的风格也更为均衡，覆盖面更广。
ETF规模逼近4万亿元
ETF规模的强劲增长，缘于长线资金的持续买入。
在“国家队”、金融机构以及个人资金的不断接力下，ETF规模不断攀升。截至4月15日，全部上市ETF规模达到3.95万亿元，ETF规模有望在近期迈过4万亿元大关。其中股票型ETF总份额接近2.04万亿份，也在不断创出历史新高。
在资金不断净流入的推动下，跟踪沪深300指数的24只ETF合计规模再破万亿元大关。此前，在2024年9月至10月期间，A股市场大反弹，曾推动沪深300ETF的总规模突破万亿元。
2024年基金年报数据显示，“国家队”频频出现在ETF的持有人名单中。以目前规模最大的华泰柏瑞沪深300ETF为例，中央汇金资产管理有限责任公司2024年底增持近260亿份，份额规模达到266.21亿份，中央汇金投资有限责任公司和中央汇金资产管理有限责任公司两家公司合计持有该ETF的份额占比已超过69%。
除了上述公司以外，中国国新、中国诚通等长线资金也多次宣布增持ETF，一些国资机构以及险资等中长期资金已成为A股市场股票ETF的重要持有人。
东吴证券 数据显示，截至2024年末，“国家队”持有A股ETF共1.05万亿元，占A股ETF总规模的36.1%，其中，在中证1000ETF、上证180ETF、沪深300ETF的持有占比均高于70%。“国家队”所偏好的15只ETF上周共计净流入1519亿元。
与此同时，一大批股票ETF正处于发行募集期，有望为A股持续带来增量资金。数据显示，截至4月16日，共有22只股票ETF处于发售阶段，其中12只ETF为 自由现金流 主题ETF，另有汇添富中证 机器人 ETF、招商中证卫星产业ETF、华夏国证航天航空行业ETF等行业主题ETF，以及博时中证A50ETF、融通深证100ETF等宽基ETF。
政策应对仍有较大空间
对于近期A股市场的表现以及未来A股走势，景顺长城基金基金经理余广认为，中国在宏观政策应对方面具有较大的发力空间，如降准降息、刺激内需和扩大国内需求，以应对外部冲击。同时，A股的估值处于低位，下跌风险相对可控。
博时基金宏观策略部表示，美国加征关税落地抑制了市场风险偏好，叠加国内政策空窗期，指数进入短暂的震荡颠簸期。配置上适度向哑铃型的价值、防御端倾斜，待财报和外部风险落地后，市场或迎来新的机会。
长城基金高级宏观策略研究员汪立指出，短期内增量的宏观事件仍是未来一段时间的主要变量，市场可能处于波动较大、没有明确方向的阶段。另外，前期政策资金和央国企 回购 构筑的底部可能是当前市场的重要支撑。短期来看，市场有底有顶，底部来自政策资金做多带来的价格底，顶部来自出口受损预期带来的股市折价压力；中期看，市场仍需看到比较强力的政策刺激，才有持续做多的动力。
具体策略来看，余广认为，宏观和市场仍存在不确定性，短期建议密切关注谈判走势以及各企业应对方案。下跌中更看重公司估值和基本面，基于中长期角度，自下而上选股来应对短期波动。关注被动下跌的内需股、互联网科技股、自主可控板块。
汪立指出，市场的中期方向仍有赖于政策的支持，如果出台的是补充流动性相关政策，风险偏好抬升可能是市场主逻辑，科技等可能是更好的 资产 ；如果是基本面刺激的政策，政策重点补贴方向可能也是市场交易的方向。",2025-04-17T01:49:00.000+03:00,https://finance.sina.com.cn/stock/relnews/us/2025-04-17/doc-inetmkhi3883781.shtml,sina.com.cn,positive
【环球财经】法国2025年3月CPI小幅上涨0.8%|法国_新浪财经_新浪网,"新华财经巴黎4月16日电（记者李文昕）根据法国国家统计和经济研究所15日公布的最终结果，法国2025年3月消费者价格指数（CPI）同比上涨0.8%，涨幅与2月相同；环比下跌0.2%，较2月0.5%的环比跌幅有所收窄。
具体来看，法国3月CPI小幅上涨主要归因于制成品季节性涨价，环比涨幅为1.1%，特别是在冬季促销后服装和鞋类价格环比上涨5.7%。
由于石油产品价格下跌，3月能源价格继上月环比下跌4.6%后继续下跌1.5%；从同比来看，3月能源价格则下跌6.6%。服务价格尽管环比保持稳定，但同比上升2.3%，主要由保险价格加速上涨拉动。此外，食品价格环比回升0.3%，同比上涨0.6%。

"新发现！紫色新""雪莲""|中国科学院_新浪财经_新浪网","海拔4000米的高山上，发现紫色新“雪莲”
记者从中国科学院华南植物园植物分类与多样性研究团队获悉， 该团队在海拔4000米的横断山脉和青藏高原交界处发现了一个菊科风毛菊属新种，并根据其产地德格县命名为“德格雪莲”。 该新种描述和命名的相关文章，于北京时间4月15日在国际植物分类学期刊《植物分类》上在线发表。
风毛菊属的不少种类为我国著名的传统药用植物雪莲的来源植物，这一发现为已知的雪莲家族增添了一个新成员。
论文第一作者、中国科学院华南植物园助理研究员徐连升介绍，德格雪莲是多年生草本植物。其茎直立，叶片厚实，且呈现特有形态：边缘是皱波状，有锯齿；中上部叶逐渐变为膜质，并由绿色变为紫色。头状花序有4至15个，聚集成伞房状，小花则呈现深紫色。
徐连升说，这一新种发现源于团队早前的一项分子系统学研究。当时，团队发现5份“钝苞雪莲”样品与其他样品并不形成单系。2023年至2024年，团队在对标本查阅后，深入祁连山北部的高山灌丛和横断山中部的高山草甸间进行了野外考察。最终发现，这5份样本具有一致的形态特征，但与钝苞雪莲存在显著差异，具体表现为：叶片更大且边缘呈波状皱褶、苞片数量更多、总苞片顶端非钝形。基于此，团队认为这是一个新物种。
据介绍，中国是雪莲的家乡，拥有绝大多数种类，主要分布在海拔3000米到5000米的高原地区。",2025-04-17T01:45:00.000+03:00,https://finance.sina.com.cn/jjxw/2025-04-17/doc-inetmkhf9498926.shtml,sina.com.cn,positive
JIA clears runway for growth with new parking garage and terminal expansion construction approved - NewsBreak,"The Jacksonville International Airport has received approval to move forward with a garage expansion that will add over 2,000 additional parking spaces. The Jacksonville Aviation Authority told Action News Jax Nicholas Brooks this is in response to rapid growth at the airport. JIA saw an all-time high of 7.6 million passengers in 2024. According to JIA, they’re seeing more travelers after adding new airlines like Breeze Airways and Avelo . “We have more new services added at our airport than we ever had and now the travelers are taking advantage of the new nonstop services,” said Vice President of Jacksonville Aviation Authority External Affairs, Michael Stewart. Travelers say they are noticing more construction at the airport. It’s because of an incoming $92 million parking garage that will add 2,000 spaces. Stewart said builders received the green light Monday to begin construction on JIA’s third parking garage, next to the existing daily garage. “The garage itself is the final piece of the project that we’ve got going on,” said Stewart. Related: Jacksonville International Airport breaks ground on massive project to expand Concourse B Inside the airport, a $344 million project is adding Concourse B — a third concourse with six gates and three levels. It will also feature new restaurants and amenities for passengers. “We’re trying to keep pace with the growth,” Stewart added.

I think it’s important to be forward-thinking,” said traveler John Toensing. A former JIA employee said the project is long overdue. “I used to work here. Trying to find parking was very stressful,” said Traver Stephania Denis.

《貴金屬》COMEX黃金上漲3.3%再創歷史新高,"MoneyDJ新聞 2025-04-17 06:15:36 記者 黃文章 報導紐約商品期貨交易所（COMEX）6月黃金期貨4月16日收盤上漲106美元或3.3%至每盎司3,346.4美元，再度創下歷史新高，因投資人在關稅戰當中持續尋求避險，累計今年來金價已上漲700美元；美元指數下跌0.9%，5月白銀期貨上漲2.1%至每盎司32.98美元。紐約商業交易所（NYMEX）7月鉑金期貨上漲1%至每盎司980.1美元，6月鈀金期貨上漲0.1%至每盎司979.6美元。 富拓（FXTM）資深研究分析師盧克曼·奧圖努加（Lukman Otunuga）表示：「在美元普遍走弱、關稅政策宣布的不確定性以及對全球經濟衰退的擔憂之下，黃金仍受到強力支撐。」盛寶銀行（Saxo Bank）大宗商品策略主管奧勒·漢森（Ole Hansen）表示：「金價這波漲勢已顯得有些脫離基本面，因此存在回調風險；但在過去一年多的時間裡，每次回調都相對溫和，因為一旦出現下跌，就會有潛在買盤進場承接。」 全球最大黃金ETF道富財富黃金指數基金（SPDR Gold Shares, GLD）16日黃金持有量增加4.02公噸至957.17公噸，續創2022年9月以來新高。最大的白銀ETF安碩白銀指數基金（iShares Silver Trust, SLV），白銀持有量增加93.37公噸至14,066.34公噸。 世界黃金協會（WGC）中國區研究主管賈舒暢報告表示，儘管黃金進口和珠寶需求持續下滑，中國黃金市場在3月及整個第一季仍表現強勁，國內金價與黃金ETF資金流入創下新高，且央行持續買入黃金，突顯出黃金市場強勢上漲的態勢。 賈舒暢指出，3月黃金價格持續強勢上漲，中國與全球市場均創下歷史新高。以上海黃金交易所午後定盤價計算，3月是過去一年最強的月份；而以美元計價的倫敦黃金定盤價也達到自2020年7月以來的最高水平。報告表示：「地緣政治緊張局勢以及川普難以預測的貿易政策，使黃金作為避險資產的吸引力提升，美元走弱與黃金ETF投資增加也進一步推升價格。」 3月份金價強勁漲勢，也為第一季度帶來亮眼表現，人民幣與美元金價均上漲19%。以人民幣計價的金價創下自2002年上海黃金交易所成立以來最強的第一季；美元金價則創下自1975年以來的最佳第一季表現。 今年第一季金價上漲的主要驅動因素包括：在全球地緣政治與貿易政策風險升高之際，避險需求上升；對美國經濟成長與聯準會利率走勢的擔憂導致美元走弱；以及全球黃金ETF的強勁資金流入。 不過，中國第一季黃金批發需求仍然疲軟。第一季中國黃金批發需求為336公噸，比十年平均水平低29%，較去年第一季下降36%。賈舒暢表示，第一季黃金批發需求的疲軟主要源自於較高的基期，2024年1月創下有記錄以來最強的批發需求；而金價飆升也壓抑了珠寶需求。 另一方面，高企的金價有助於推動投資需求。中國黃金ETF已連續第二個月出現資金淨流入，3月總計達人民幣56億元（約合7.72億美元），持續的資金流入與金價上漲將總管理資產規模推至另一個月末高點——人民幣1010億元（約合140億美元）。黃金ETF總持倉增加7.7公噸至138公噸，也創下歷史新高。 賈舒暢表示，飆升的金價仍是3月中國黃金ETF資金流入的主要驅動力，全球貿易不確定性及其對本地經濟的潛在衝擊也進一步推升投資需求。2月與3月的強勁需求也促使中國黃金ETF創下單季流入紀錄。2025年第一季度流入資金達人民幣167億元（約合23億美元），相當於持倉增加23公噸——雙雙創下歷史新高。報告指出，前所未見的金價飆升、對其他本地資產信心不足，以及與美國升級的貿易衝突引發的成長擔憂，都是強勁資金流入的原因。 報告指出，值得注意的是，中國黃金ETF創紀錄的資金流入在第二季度仍在持續，截至4月前兩週，中國黃金ETF持倉又增加了29公噸，而總資產管理規模也在金價持續走強與美中貿易緊張升溫的背景下激增25%。 中國的官方黃金儲備在3月也再次上升。中國人民銀行3月份黃金儲備較前月增加9萬盎司或2.8公噸，達到7,370萬盎司或2,292.33公噸，為連續第5個月購入黃金（累計購入28公噸）。2025年第一季，中國共購買12.8公噸黃金。 報告表示，中國1月的黃金進口幾乎停滯，僅為17公噸，創下自2021年2月以來的最低月度數值——當時正值COVID防疫限制影響進口；2月進口回升至76公噸，但仍遠低於2024年平均每月的102公噸。從淨進口數據來看，疲弱情況更加明顯。1月普通黃金淨進口降至零，為2021年初以來最低；2月回升至49公噸，但仍較去年同期下降38%。 報告表示，短期內黃金投資需求預計將保持強勁，因美中貿易戰升溫打擊經濟增長與本地資產。受到全球貿易秩序重構與市場波動性的推動，全球黃金價格的強勢將提供進一步支撐。此外，儘管即將到來的中國五一勞動節假期可能提振銷售，創紀錄的高金價與經濟擔憂仍令黃金飾品需求前景蒙上陰影，但避險購買可能帶來一定支撐。 紐約商品期貨交易所（COMEX）5月期銅4月16日收盤上漲1.5%至每磅4.6855美元。 （圖片來源：MoneyDJ理財網資料庫） ＊編者按：本文僅供參考之用，並不構成要約、招攬或邀請、誘使、任何不論種類或形式之申述或訂立任何建議及推薦，讀者務請運用個人獨立思考能力，自行作出投資決定，如因相關建議招致損失，概與《精實財經媒體》、編者及作者無涉。",2025-04-17T01:15:00.000+03:00,https://www.moneydj.com/kmdj/news/newsviewer.aspx?a=0921943a-d8ec-454a-92e3-501ceaccd819&c=MB010000,MoneyDJ新聞,positive

In response to ongoing youth-led protests and institutional disruptions, he pledged to uphold the rule of law and encourage open dialogue while safeguarding the rights of all citizens.
""Protests and expressions of discontent are natural for the youth,"" Macut said, ""but blockades and the denial of others' rights to work, study, or live normally are unacceptable.""
He announced the formation of a Council for Youth and Talents, which he will personally oversee.
The council aims to nurture young talent and harness their potential for the country's development.
On international affairs, Macut reaffirmed Serbia's sovereign and balanced approach.
While underscoring Serbia's commitment to the European Union (EU) accession process, he emphasised the country's independence in policymaking.
""Serbia does not approach the EU from a position of pleading, but from one of conviction. This relationship is a partnership founded on mutual respect, not asymmetry,"" he said.
He also stressed that domestic reforms are guided by national priorities rather than external demands.
""Our reforms are not a response to EU requirements. They are a response to the needs of our citizens,"" Macut added.
He also reaffirmed Serbia's dedication to broad international cooperation, saying that the country will ""extend hands of cooperation to all"".
Macut also addressed the Kosovo issue, calling it the highest national priority.
""We do not abandon our principles, but we do not reject dialogue. Peace is impossible without justice,"" he asserted.
Macut's nomination follows the resignation of former Prime Minister Milos Vucevic, who stepped down on January 28 amid mounting tensions following the deadly canopy collapse at the Novi Sad railway station in November 2024, which resulted in 16 fatalities.
The National Assembly officially confirmed Vucevic's resignation on March 19.

Legislators Pass Their Version of $60 Billion Budget | Pith in the Wind | Nashville News | nashvillescene.com,"The Tennessee House and Senate passed a revised version of Gov. Bill Lee's $59.8 billion budget on Wednesday.
Sen. Bo Watson (R-Hixson) said the legislature’s amendment funded their own priorities without increasing the bottom line by redirecting funding from the governor’s proposed budget amendment.
“While some members may see dark clouds on the horizon for the state of Tennessee,” said Watson, “this budget looks forward and I believe puts us in a position to handle any storms that might come our way.”
Watson said for members who were looking for any reason to support the budget, the bill includes $42 million specifically for grants in House and Senate initiatives. The budget also includes $46 million disaster relief funding, $5.4 million for safety upgrades at the University of Memphis, $78 million from TennCare Shared Savings for rural hospitals’ uncompensated care and an additional $35.6 million to the Rainy Day Fund.
Amid the historic local university’s financial turmoil, we examine the school’s past and future
The budget passed the House first (79-16-1) with several amendments. House Amendment 3 makes several changes. Among the most notable is a change allowing Tennessee State University to utilize funds for operations that had previously only been approved for capital projects. The reappropriation of funds is something Rep. Harold Love (D-Nashville) had pushed for this session as a means
to help the university right-side its finances.
Another amendment was added to the House legislation appropriating $8 million for reimbursements to county election commissions for primary elections. That was based on a bill sponsored by Senate Majority Leader Jack Johnson (R-Franklin), which passed in the House on Monday. For the budget, lawmakers approved House Amendments 2, 3, 4, 12 and 16.
Both Republican and Democratic members who spoke thanked representatives and staff for their work on the budget. Democrats still scolded Republicans for not doing enough to help Tennesseans who are feeling the strain of today’s economy.
Sen. Jeff Yarbro (D-Nashville), who sits on the Finance, Ways and Means Committee, spoke first on the appropriations bill, saying that while he thought a lot of the work that had been done made this budget better than the version submitted by the governor, he still wasn’t sure he could commit to voting for it. In the 30-2-1 vote, he ultimately voted against the budget, along with Sen. Charlene Oliver (D-Nashville). Senate Democratic Caucus Chair London Lamar (D-Memphis) voted “present.”
“I think that we can do better,” Yarbro said. “We’ve got to start dealing with some of these critical issues.”
Several amendments by Democrats in both the House and Senate were also not added to the bill, being either tabled or withdrawn due to lack of member support. In the Senate, Yarbro suggested an amendment to hold off on funding the governor’s Education Freedom Scholarship Act, known to provide vouchers for children to attend private schools. Yarbro’s amendment would have removed $150 million from the budget for the first year of the program, but would have preserved funding that was promised to school systems and teachers.
Johnson moved to table the motion, noting that in the budget they had proposed an addition of $244 million for the public schools funding formula and highlighted other funds for public education.
""We are doing a lot for public education, and we have in recent years,” Johnson said. “But while we do that, we’re also going to empower parents whose children are not being served by the public school system.”
With the budget now passed, the 114th General Assembly could wrap up its 2025 session as early as next week.",2025-04-17T01:35:00.000+03:00,https://www.nashvillescene.com/news/pithinthewind/state-legislature-budget-2025/article_56166bcd-911c-4ed2-8fba-cafcff71e804.html,Nicolle S. Praino,positive
Trinidad and Tobago re-elected to Commission on Narcotic Drugs - Trinidad and Tobago Newsday,"TRINIDAD and Tobago has been re-elected by acclamation to serve for another four-year term on the Commission on Narcotic Drugs (CND) beginning on January 1, 2026, the Ministry of Foreign and Caricom Affairs said on April 15.
The ministry said the election took place during the 14th plenary meeting of the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) at the United Nations Headquarters in New York on April 4, where 20 members were elected to the CND including four members from the Group of Latin American and Caribbean States.
TT currently serves on the CND, having been elected for the period 2022-2025, and before this, served from 2008-2011. The Commission on Narcotic Drugs, which meets in Vienna, Austria, is the central drug policymaking body within the United Nations system, entrusted with fostering and accelerating the implementation of all international drug policy commitments.
The ministry said, as a party to all international and regional conventions, treaties, and agreements on drug control, TT remains deeply committed to addressing and countering the global drug problem and its associated challenges through international co-operation and multi-lateralism.
“TT’s successful re-election to the CND comes as this country campaigns for a non-permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council for the period 2027-2028 for which the election is expected to be held in June 2026.”
The ministry said Minister of Foreign and Caricom Affairs Dr Amery Browne conveyed his appreciation and gratitude to the entire team at the ministry’s headquarters and to the dedicated diplomats at the permanent mission of TT to the United Nations in New York, for their ongoing diligence and relentless advocacy in promoting the country’s interests at the United Nations.",2025-04-17T01:23:00.000+03:00,https://newsday.co.tt/2025/04/16/trinidad-and-tobago-re-elected-to-commission-on-narcotic-drugs,Rishard Khan,positive

四项数据看开局（经济新方位） --经济·科技--人民网,"一季度国民经济起步平稳开局良好，高质量发展向新向好
四项数据看开局（经济新方位）
人民网－人民日报
数据来源：国家统计局
生产供给较快增长，新质生产力加快培育，国内需求不断扩大，就业形势总体稳定……国家统计局4月16日发布数据显示：今年一季度，随着各项宏观政策继续发力显效，国民经济起步平稳、开局良好，高质量发展向新向好，彰显了中国经济强大的韧性和潜力。
良好开局怎么看？16日召开的国务院新闻办新闻发布会上，国家统计局副局长盛来运结合数据介绍了有关情况。
从“5.4%”看发展韧性
【亮点】一季度，国内生产总值同比增长5.4%，在全球主要经济体中名列前茅。
初步核算，一季度国内生产总值318758亿元，按不变价格计算，同比增长5.4%，比上年四季度环比增长1.2%。
这一成绩有含金量。
“5.4%的增速高于去年全年5%的增速，也高于去年一季度5.3%的增速，在全球主要经济体中名列前茅，延续了稳中向好、稳中回升的态势。”盛来运说。
含金量，体现在生产需求等主要指标的稳中有升，也体现在就业收入总体稳定、国际收支状况良好方面。
看就业收入。一季度，全国城镇调查失业率平均值为5.3%，3月份为5.2%，比上月回落0.2个百分点。全国居民人均可支配收入扣除物价因素，实际增长5.6%，与国内生产总值增长基本同步。
看国际收支。今年以来，全球经济增长动能偏弱，但我国进出口保持基本平稳态势：一季度，货物贸易进出口同比增长1.3%，出口增长6.9%；1至2月份，服务进出口额增长9.9%；3月末，外汇储备余额保持在3.2万亿美元以上。
这一成绩来之不易。
“今年以来，国际环境变乱交织，不利影响加深，国内结构调整阵痛仍在释放，不少企业经营比较困难。面对复杂局面，各地区各部门加快落实更加积极有为的宏观政策，有力有效应对外部挑战。”盛来运认为，前期出台的宏观政策和今年以来扩容加码的增量政策叠加发力，有效扩大了需求、促进了生产、激发了活力、增强了信心，推动经济实现良好开局。
这一成绩，进一步增强了前行信心。
美国大搞关税壁垒和贸易霸凌，对世界经济秩序造成严重冲击。“从短期来看，美国加征高额关税会对我国经济和外贸带来一定压力，但是改变不了中国经济持续长期向好的大势。”盛来运表示，中国经济基础稳、优势多、韧性强、潜力大，有底气、有信心、有能力应对外部挑战，实现既定发展目标。
从“4.6%”看消费潜力
【亮点】一季度，社会消费品零售总额增长4.6%，比上年全年加快1.1个百分点。
一季度，社会消费品零售总额124671亿元，同比增长4.6%，比上年全年加快1.1个百分点，而且增速逐月回升。3月份，社会消费品零售总额增长5.9%，比1至2月份加快1.9个百分点。
“扩大内需、提振消费等方面政策持续发挥作用，效果比较明显。”盛来运说。
商品零售增长较快。一季度，“两新”政策带动相关消费品保持两位数增长，反映出市场销售状况不断好转。电动自行车、手机、平板、智能手表等新扩围的产品销售增速很高。一季度，限额以上单位通讯器材类商品零售额同比增长26.9%，文化办公用品类增长21.7%，家用电器和音像器材类增长19.3%，家具类增长18.1%，仅这4项就拉动社会消费品零售总额增长1.4个百分点。
服务消费方兴未艾。一季度，服务零售额同比增长5%，比商品零售高0.4个百分点。与消费结构升级相关的消费保持两位数增长。一季度，居民人均交通通信支出同比增长10.4%，教育文化娱乐支出增长13.9%；居民人均服务性消费支出同比增长5.4%，占全部居民人均消费支出的比重达到43.4%，比去年同期提高0.1个百分点。“服务消费是未来支撑消费增长的一个重要领域，发展空间非常大。”盛来运说。
消费新动能持续释放。随着大数据、人工智能加速运用，直播带货、即时零售、“夜经济”、数字消费、人工智能游戏等消费场景不断创新拓展，一些文化类消费也较快增长。
“消费是收入的函数，要大力提振消费，也要大力促进消费能力的提升。”盛来运表示，下一步，要落实好《提振消费专项行动方案》，积极稳就业、促增收、减负担，提升居民消费能力，大力增加优质消费供给，持续释放消费潜力。
从“9.7%”看创新动能
【亮点】一季度，规模以上高技术制造业增加值同比增长9.7%，新质生产力培育壮大。
一季度，规模以上高技术制造业增加值同比增长9.7%，信息传输、软件和信息技术服务业增加值增长10.3%，显示产业创新动力在增强。
从细分数据不难看出，开年以来，新质生产力正在培育壮大，高质量发展取得新成效。
向新逐高，经济结构进一步优化。从产业结构看，一季度，规模以上装备制造业、高技术制造业增加值占规模以上工业的比重分别为33.7%、15.7%，同比分别提高1.9个、0.5个百分点，工业向高端化、智能化、绿色化转型的趋势明显。从需求结构看，一季度，高技术产业投资同比增长6.5%，占全部投资比重为10.3%。
扩大开放，贸易新格局加快形成。近几年，我国积极开拓国际市场，构建贸易多元化格局，已与世界上150多个国家和地区成为贸易伙伴。一季度，对共建“一带一路”国家的出口同比增长7.2%，货物进出口额占全部进出口额比重超过50%。
绿色转型，发展底色更加亮丽。一季度，以新能源车、锂电池、光伏为代表的新能源产业继续保持较高增长速度，非化石能源消费占能源消费总量的比重比上年同期提升1.5个百分点。
守住底线，安全发展取得新进展。能源保供有力有效，原油、原煤生产稳中有增。化解地方债、中小金融机构、房地产等风险的政策积极有效。
“无论国际形势怎么变化，我们都要坚定不移推动高质量发展，以中国高质量发展的确定性来应对外部变化的不确定性。”盛来运表示。
从“0.4%”看市场活力
【亮点】一季度，民间投资同比增长0.4%，由上年全年下降转为增长，彰显出民营经济活力在提升。
民营经济是推进中国式现代化的生力军，是高质量发展的重要基础。“各地方各部门认真贯彻落实民营企业座谈会精神，把党中央对发展民营经济的要求落实落地，取得明显成效。”盛来运结合数据作了分析。
生产经营在改善。一季度，规模以上工业企业中，私营企业增加值同比增长7.3%，增速比上年全年有所回升，且快于全部规模以上工业企业增速。
活力动力在增强。一季度制造业民间投资同比增长9.7%，基础设施民间投资增长9.3%，均快于各自领域平均增速。从进出口看，一季度民营企业进出口额同比增长5.8%，快于全部进出口额增速，占全部进出口总额的比重提升到56.8%。
创新动能更强劲。“从生成式人工智能到人工智能机器人，再到民用航空、量子信息等多个领域，今年以来，民营企业的科技创新成果不断涌现，民营经济展现出强大的创新活力、潜力和市场竞争力。”盛来运说。
从全部投资来看，今年一季度，全国固定资产投资（不含农户）同比增长4.2%，比上年全年加快1.0个百分点；扣除房地产开发投资，增长8.3%。
这得益于一系列政策的助推。盛来运列出一组数据：一季度，新增专项债累计发行量接近1万亿元，固定资产投资本年实际到位资金同比增长3.7%，基础设施投资增长5.8%，比上年全年加快1.4个百分点；在大规模设备更新政策带动下，一季度设备工器具购置投资同比增长19%，比去年全年加快3.3个百分点，对全部投资增长贡献率为64.6%，有效拉动了投资。
“中国有14亿多人口，市场规模巨大，人均国内生产总值超过1.3万美元，正处在消费升级的关键阶段，市场成长性好，无论是投资还是消费空间都非常大，将支撑中国经济持续发展。”盛来运说。
记者手记
“稳、新、韧”，中国经济底气足
深度求索（DeepSeek）大模型火爆全球，“人造太阳”刷新纪录，家电卖场人头攒动，节日消费热度升温……开年以来，一幕幕微观图景释放出发展向新向好的积极信号。“一季报”中，一组组数据再次印证了中国经济回升向好的良好态势。从中，不难读出“稳、新、韧”的鲜明特点。
“稳”，体现在经济底盘之稳。纵向看，一季度国内生产总值5.4%的增速高于去年全年的5%，也高于去年一季度的5.3%。横向比，这一增速在全球主要经济体中名列前茅。拿出这样的表现，中国经济不愧是“世界经济增长的主要贡献者和稳定锚”。
“新”，可从供需两端的新气象观之。看需求，市场销售增速回升，以旧换新相关商品销售增长较快，出行、旅游、餐饮等服务消费方兴未艾。随着全方位扩大内需相关政策见效，强大国内市场的潜力正稳步释放。看生产，规上装备制造业增加值同比两位数增长，高技术制造业跑出加速度，彰显了产业体系完备的独特优势、产业升级的澎湃动能。
“韧”，外贸体现得明显。一季度，在全球经济不确定性上升的背景下，我国货物出口同比增长6.9%，充分证明了中国制造的硬核实力、贸易多元化格局带来的抗冲击能力。“韧”，还体现在民营企业顽强的生命力。克服压力、直面困难，一季度民间投资由上年全年下降转为增长，背后是发展环境改善、民企信心增强。广大经营主体坚韧不拔，中国经济就更有韧劲。
良好开局，为实现全年经济社会发展目标任务开了个好头，为决战决胜“十四五”鼓舞了士气，也为中国号巨轮应对风险挑战、栉风沐雨前行注入了坚实底气。
集中精力办好自己的事情，中国经济必将稳中有进、持续向好。

Serbian Parliament approves new govt led by Djuro Macut,"Belgrade, April 17 : The National Assembly of Serbia has elected a new government led by endocrinologist Djuro Macut.
A total of 153 members of Parliament voted on Wednesday in favour, 46 opposed, while 51 lawmakers were absent from the session.
The new Cabinet will comprise 31 members, Xinhua news agency reported.
Macut presented his government's programme and cabinet lineup on Tuesday, the first day of the special session of the National Assembly, outlining the key priorities of his administration.
Macut emphasised that his government would focus on domestic stabilisation and strategic foreign policy.
In response to ongoing youth-led protests and institutional disruptions, he pledged to uphold the rule of law and encourage open dialogue while safeguarding the rights of all citizens.

GITEX Africa 2025 Closes with a Bold Vision for Africa's Digital Future,"Rabat – GITEX Africa 2025 wrapped up in Marrakech with the kind of energy you don’t bottle, you build on.
Over three days, this renowned Moroccan city became the continent’s nerve center for ambition, collaboration, and unapologetic innovation.
There were robots and pitch decks, panels and power suits. But what truly defined this year’s GITEX wasn’t the gadgets, it was the pulse.
A steady rhythm of optimism, resilience, and the shared belief that Africa is no longer the world’s “next big thing.” It is the big thing.
Tech leaders, startups, investors, and public sector pioneers from over 130 countries gathered in Morocco’s red city, exchanging ideas casually.
Yet beneath the charm was a deeper current: a desire to forge partnerships that stick, solve problems that matter, and tell Africa’s digital story from the inside out.
Conversations pulsed through every hall, about digital inclusion, AI ethics, cross-border collaboration, and how to scale innovation without losing its soul.
There was less jargon, more honesty. Less flash, more substance. People didn’t just want to pitch; they wanted to listen, learn, and rethink how innovation can be more human.
Marrakech itself played no small role. Against a backdrop of terracotta architecture and clear April skies, the city offered symbolism.
Here was a place with deep historical roots, hosting a conversation about digital futures. It felt right.
The real magic of GITEX Africa 2025 wasn’t on stage, it was in the corners of the venue, where a Nigerian fintech founder chatted with a Kenyan logistics expert.
Where a Moroccan coder gave advice to a South African student. Where business cards were exchanged, yes, but also eye contact, laughter, and genuine curiosity.
As the final day wrapped up, there was no sense of closure, just momentum. And maybe that’s the most telling part.
GITEX Africa didn’t feel like an event that ended; it felt like a movement that grew louder with every edition.
So what’s next? More collaboration. More inclusion. More African-led innovation shaping global conversations, and most importantly the new GITEX Health that is planned to be next year in Casablanca.
Marrakech may be quieter now, but the ideas sparked here won’t rest. They’ll travel. They’ll evolve and they’ll stay rooted in the one thing GITEX Africa 2025 made clear: Africa’s future is already in motion, and it’s digital.",2025-04-17T01:46:00.000+03:00,https://www.moroccoworldnews.com/2025/04/190568/gitex-africa-2025-closes-with-a-bold-vision-for-africas-digital-future,Zayneb Elasraoui,positive
我国加入港口国措施协定 - 福建日报数字报,"据新华社北京4月16日电 《关于预防、制止和消除非法、不报告、不管制捕鱼的港口国措施协定》于4月16日对中国正式生效。这标志着我国在持续打击非法捕捞、保护海洋渔业资源等方面迈出重要步伐。
这是记者16日在农业农村部举办的新闻发布会上了解到的。港口国措施协定由联合国粮农组织牵头制定，是近年来在全球渔业治理、打击非法捕捞方面最重要的国际文书，旨在通过有效实施港口国措施，阻止非法捕捞的渔获物经由港口进入国际国内市场，确保对海洋生物资源和海洋生态系统的长期养护和可持续利用。
“此次加入协定，意味着我国在渔业管理方面将承担更多国际责任。”农业农村部渔业渔政管理局局长刘新中解释说，从我国港口上岸或者进港的渔船将按照协定规定的措施实施监管，同时作为船旗国，我国渔船要进入到其他国家或者经济体，上岸、卸货、交易也要服从协定规定，接受相关检查。此外，要参与协定的完善、提升、普及和执行。
刘新中表示，加入协定将有利于我国深入参与国际渔业治理，严厉打击非法捕捞，保护海洋渔业资源，并提升港口管理水平，完善全链条监管体系，推动渔业产业现代化发展，促进高水平对外开放。
协定的实施是一项系统性工程。刘新中表示，为了确保这项工作实施好，建立了中央层面和地方层面的协调机制。
下一步，农业农村部将开展专项执法行动，部署做好涉渔外国籍船舶的监督检查工作，并于近期举办执法能力培训，进一步提升履约能力。还将统筹相关高校和直属事业单位相关力量，参加协定的审查、评估及后续规则谈判，为协定实施提供法律、技术等支撑保障。

Ocasio-Cortez bate récords de recaudación de fondos en EE. UU.,"Ocasio-Cortez bate récords de recaudación de fondos en EE. UU.
La representante demócrata Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez recaudó 9,6 millones de dólares en el primer trimestre de 2025. Se trata de una gran cifra para la legisladora progresista que recorrió el país junto al senador Bernie Sanders.
La representante demócrata por Nueva York, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, recaudó 9,6 millones de dólares en los primeros tres meses del año, más del doble de su segundo trimestre más alto.
Según un reporte del diario Político, la recaudación masiva se produce en medio de crecientes pedidos de los progresistas para que se presente en las primarias de 2028 contra el líder de la minoría del Senado, Chuck Schumer.
""Ocasio-Cortez, quien ahora cuenta con más de ocho millones de dólares en efectivo, pasó las últimas semanas en un recorrido por el país con el senador Bernie Sanders (independiente por Vermont) en su gira Combatiendo la Oligarquía, y atrajo a miles de simpatizantes"", contextualizó la fuente.
I cannot convey enough how grateful I am to the millions of people supporting us with your time, resources, & energy.

All with an avg donation of $21.
THANK YOU & Pa’lante 🙏🏽♥️[https://t.co/gv7dR2ICGC][April 15, 2025]
La líder del movimiento progresista ""lleva mucho tiempo impulsando la recaudación de fondos a través de una amplia red de pequeños donantes"".
Mediante una publicación en la plataforma en X, la demócrata explicó que la donación promedio de campaña fue de 21 dólares.
“No puedo expresar con palabras mi gratitud a los millones de personas que nos apoyan con su tiempo, recursos y energía”, dijo Ocasio-Cortez sobre su recaudación de fondos.

一季度GDP5.4%，新动能按下经济加速键-千龙网·中国首都网,"来自高技术制造业和装备制造业的强劲增长，是中国经济高质量发展的重要体现。
4月16日，国家统计局网站发布数据，初步核算，一季度国内生产总值318758亿元，按不变价格计算，同比增长5.4%，比上年四季度环比增长1.2%。分产业看，第一产业增加值11713亿元，同比增长3.5%；第二产业增加值111903亿元，增长5.9%；第三产业增加值195142亿元，增长5.3%。
从产业数据变化来看，第二产业增长速度明显领先其他行业。其中，高技术制造业、装备制造业销售收入同比分别增长12.1%和9.7%，增速较2024年分别加快3.1个和3.5个百分点。计算机制造、通信设备制造、电子工业专用设备制造销售收入同比分别增长29.8%、17.8%和16.4%，反映我国制造业向中高端价值链持续迈进。
从制造业的基本盘整体向好再到高新技术制造业的加速度，第二产业的变化不仅展示了“中国制造”依然是经济增长的强大驱动力，也反映出我国经济结构持续优化、产业升级步伐加快的态势。特别是计算机制造、通信设备制造、电子工业专用设备制造的显著增长，也进一步证明新质生产力正在成为拉动经济增长的重要马车。
回过头看，制造业基本盘的稳健，是我国经济持续健康发展的“压舱石”。在当前全球经济形势复杂多变的背景下，我国制造业能够保持如此强劲的增长势头，得益于多方面因素的共同作用。
一方面，通过减税降费、优化营商环境等一系列举措，有效激发了企业活力，为制造业发展创造了有利条件；另一方面，科技创新作为引领发展的第一动力，在制造业领域得到了充分体现。
科技创新的新动能注入，也为经济增长按下加速键。智能制造推动生产方式深刻变革，自动化、智能化设备广泛应用，极大提升生产效率。绿色能源的崛起改变传统能源结构，光伏、风电等产业快速发展，助力可持续发展。数字经济的蓬勃发展更是开辟了新的增长空间，大数据、云计算、人工智能等技术催生众多新业态、新模式，为经济增长注入源源不断的动力。
制造业向中高端价值链的迈进，也是中国制造向中国创造转变的关键一步。随着数字经济的快速发展，数字技术与制造业深度融合，这不仅为制造业注入了新的活力，也催生了大量新产业、新业态、新模式，成为拉动经济增长的重要引擎。
工业是现代经济的核心枢纽，第二产业的发展也能够带动相关产业的繁荣，形成产业链上下游的协同效应。比如，电子工业专用设备制造的快速增长，为电子信息产业的发展提供了有力支撑；而通信设备的普及和升级，进一步促进了信息通信技术的广泛应用和深度融合。这种产业链的良性互动，不仅提升了整个产业的稳定性和竞争力，也为经济高质量发展奠定了坚实基础。
当然，需要清醒地认识到，在全球政治经济出现极大不确定性的情况下，制造业发展仍面临一些挑战和困难。比如，关键核心技术领域的短板依然存在，部分企业创新能力不足，国际市场竞争压力加大等。这些在中短期依然可能会成为影响企业经营乃至发展的重要变量。
面对多变的环境，更要保持定力，继续坚持创新驱动发展战略，加大科技创新投入，推动产学研深度融合，加快突破关键核心技术。同时，还要进一步优化营商环境，降低企业运营成本，激发市场活力和社会创造力。
来自高技术制造业和装备制造业的强劲增长，是中国经济高质量发展的重要体现。有理由相信，在各方共同努力下，中国制造业将继续沿着中高端价值链的方向稳步前行，为建设制造强国、实现经济高质量发展做出更大贡献。这也将进一步增强中国经济的国际竞争力，为全球经济复苏和开放注入更多动能。",2025-04-17T01:58:08.023+03:00,https://review.qianlong.com/2025/0417/8471323.shtml,,positive

Trump reports 'big progress' in tariff talks with Japanese officials,"Trump reports 'big progress' in tariff talks with Japanese officials
Japan one of the first to start tariff negotiations
WASHINGTON/TOYKO — President Donald Trump said there was ""big progress"" when he made the surprise move on Wednesday to negotiate directly with Japanese officials about the barrage of tariffs he has imposed on global imports.
""A Great Honor to have just met with the Japanese Delegation on Trade. Big Progress!"" Trump said in a social media message that contained no details of the discussions.
ADVERTISEMENT
Tokyo sent its Economic Revitalisation Minister Ryosei Akazawa to kickstart the talks, and he was due to brief reporters on Wednesday evening about the Washington meeting.
The Japanese official had hoped to limit the discussions to trade and investment matters. But Trump weighed in early on Wednesday, saying he would also be there to raise issues including how much Tokyo pays towards hosting U.S. troops in Japan, the biggest U.S. overseas deployment.
""Japan is coming in today to negotiate Tariffs, the cost of military support, and 'TRADE FAIRNESS',"" he said in a post on Truth Social.
""I will attend the meeting, along with Treasury & Commerce Secretaries. Hopefully something can be worked out which is good (GREAT!) for Japan and the USA!"" U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick participated along with other officials.
Trump's announcement earlier this month of sharp tariff increases on trading partners around the world has ignited worries about risks of a recession, higher inflation and rising interest rates and sent financial markets reeling.
Bessent also wanted to discuss the thorny issue of exchange rates with Japan, one of the first countries to begin face-to-face negotiations since Trump announced sweeping duties on dozens of countries — both friend and foe — earlier this month.
Japan has been hit with 24% levies on its exports to the United States although these rates have, like most of Trump's tariffs, been paused for 90 days. But a 10% universal rate remains in place as does a 25% duty for cars, a mainstay of Japan's export-reliant economy.
ADVERTISEMENT
Bessent has said there is a ""first mover advantage"" given Washington has said more than 75 countries have requested talks. However, Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said on Monday that his country, a close U.S. ally, won't rush to reach a deal and does not plan to make big concessions.
Ishiba has, for now, ruled out countermeasures to the U.S. tariffs.
""The difficulty for the Japanese team is that the United States has created a huge amount of leverage for itself, unilaterally,"" said Kurt Tong, managing partner at The Asia Group, a Washington-based consultancy.
""The U.S. is offering to not hit Japan with sticks, and Japan is stuck in a position of offering a whole lot of carrots. And from their perspective, it feels like economic coercion,"" said Tong, a former State Department official.
Trump has long complained about the U.S. trade deficit with Japan and other countries, saying U.S. businesses have been disadvantaged by trade practices and intentional efforts by other countries to maintain weak currencies.
Tokyo denies it manipulates its yen currency to gain advantage.
Trade partners
Bessent met Vietnam's deputy prime minister last week to discuss trade and has invited South Korea's finance minister to Washington for talks next week. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni will meet Trump at the White House on Thursday to discuss tariffs imposed on the European Union.
ADVERTISEMENT
The full scope of Wednesday's discussions was not yet clear.
Bessent has said he is hoping to strike deals that would cover tariffs, non-tariff barriers and exchange rates, though Tokyo had lobbied to keep the latter separate.
Possible Japanese investment in a multi-billion dollar gas project in Alaska could also feature, Bessent has said.
Japan hopes that pledges to expand investment in the U.S. will help to convince the U.S. that the two countries can achieve a ""win-win"" situation without tariffs, Akazawa said ahead of his departure.

Legendary Blount football coach honored by state legislature - al.com,"The Alabama State Legislature recognized former Blount High School head football coach Ben Harris on Tuesday afternoon at its general session.
State Representative Napoleon Bracy of Mobile introduced a proclamation congratulating Harris for being selected for induction into the National High School Football Hall of Fame. He will be inducted June 14, 2025, at Canton, Ohio.
Harris was joined by his wife and daughter and AHSAA Associate Executive Director Brian McRae, as well as the entire legislative members from the Mobile area at the ceremony Tuesday.
“I am so grateful,” Harris said in his address to the Legislature. “I have been very blessed.”
Harris, who was inducted into the Alabama High School Sports Hall of Fame in 2013, was recognized in a proclamation compiled jointly by State Legislature’s House and Senate.
Harris attended Toulminville High School in Mobile where he was an outstanding quarterback and an All-Star basketball player. He then attended Alabama State University where he became one of the most prolific quarterbacks in Hornets history.
He took over in 1988 as head football coach at Mattie T. Blount High School in Prichard, a team that had gone 33-61-1 from 1978-1987 in the 10 years before he arrived.
Harris’ teams won four Class 5A state championships (1990, 1992, 1996, 1997) over the next 10 seasons compiling 100-30 record during that stretch and produced some of the state’s legendary stars – among them the AHSAA’s first single-season 3,000-yard rusher Sherman Williams (Alabama); defensive lineman DeMarco McNeil (Auburn), who as the first true lineman to earn the Alabama Sportswriters Association Mr. Football Award in 1998; outstanding SEC quarterback Dameyune Craig (Auburn); and wide receiver Deandre Green (Auburn), named the AHSAA’s Class 5A Back of the Year in 1998.
“I’m so excited that he is finally getting the recognition he deserved,” Craig told AL.com in February. “Coach Harris did more with less, and it was done coaching with love. He went to three straight state championships and won two from 1990-1992 and had a grand total of two Division 1 signees. He is the greatest to ever do it.”
Harris was named Alabama High School Coach of the Year twice by the news media and earned the AHSAA 5A Coach of the Year four times. He was head coach of the Alabama team in the Alabama-Mississippi All-Star Football Game in 1991 and an assistant in 1997. He also received the NFL High School Coach of the Year Award in 1997.
After a two-year break, Harris returned to coach at Daleville High School for two seasons and six more seasons at Blount before health issues forced him to finally retire. He has been honored as Citizen of the Year awards three times for civic and religious activities and was inducted into the Baldwin County High School Hall of Fame in 1999 and the Alabama State University Hall of Fame in 2024.
Harris, who is still Blount High School’s all-time career football coaching wins leader, went on to win 135 games in 19 years as a high school head coach, most of which came in two stints with Blount.
Harris is being inducted into the National High School Football Hall of Fame’s third class. Also selected is another AHSAA standout from Mobile County, Hanford Dixon. The 1974 Theodore High School graduate went on to earn All-America honors as a defensive back at Southern Mississippi.
Drafted in the first round of the 1980 draft by the Cleveland Browns, he earned All-Pro honors during his NFL career with the Browns – which spanned from 1981-1989. He finished with 26 interceptions and 440 tackles in 131 games. Dixon was inducted into the Southern Miss Hall of Fame (1980) and Mississippi Sports Hall of Fame.
Joining Harris and Dixon in the Class of 2025 are other football legends: running back Ken Hall of Sugarland (TX) High School; quarterback Tim Couch of Leslie County High School (KY); quarterback Warren Moon of Alexander Hamilton High School (CA); Olympic legend Jim Thorpe, Carlisle Indian Industrial School (PA); and quarterback Michael Vick, Warwick High School (VA). A total of 38 players and coaches are being inducted.

Reba's Law 'resurrected' after expiring in legislative committee,"CARSON CITY — Legislation that could land animal abusers in prison for as long as 10 years passed out of the Assembly Judiciary Committee this week after it appeared to die last week without a vote before the Legislature’s first deadline.
“Amendments come and go and change at rapid speed as we approach the deadline,” the committee’s chairperson, Assembly member Brittany Miller said in Monday’s work session, indicating her internal polling of committee members last week, as amendments were crafted in the final hours, did not bode well for the measure. “At no time was there anyone who doesn’t want to address the heinous crimes and acts of animal cruelty.”
Miller said lawmakers “don’t always have time to process” amendments, adding the committee was able to obtain a waiver allowing the Assembly Judiciary to vote Assembly Bill 381 out of committee. The bill, Reba’s Law, was “able to be resurrected,” Miller said, resulting in a “much more intense, robust bill than we had before.”
The measure is named for Reba, a bulldog who died of heat stroke days after she was found in a sealed tote behind a business last summer.
An amendment from the Nevada District Attorneys Association eliminated provisions that would have allowed for the prosecution of individuals who allow the abuse of an animal.
The amendment also removes language requiring permission from the animal’s owner or a veterinarian to euthanize an animal. It instead requires a peace officer to forfeit the animal to a local government if the owner does not request a hearing within a certain time frame, or cannot be found within five business days. The local government must then decide whether to euthanize the animal or transfer ownership to a rescue organization, shelter or individual.
Causing the death of an animal would be deemed a category B felony, and could land offenders in prison for one to ten years and a fine of not more than $10,000.
Clark County District Attorney Steve Wolfson complained last year he needed stiffer penalties to impose against animal abusers than those allowed by law. However, a review of cases prosecuted by Wolfson indicates he rarely seeks prison time, even in egregious cases.
Lynn Whatford, a Clark County resident who cared for community cats in her neighborhood, spent much of the last year seeking justice for a colony of two dozen cats she says disappeared one by one. She suspects her neighbor killed them.
Nevada Voters for Animals founder Gina Greisen told lawmakers that Wolfson declined to prosecute the case after Whatford discovered a trapped cat left in her neighbor’s yard without protection from the sun and a high temperature of 114 degrees on July 25, the day the cat likely died. A veterinarian’s post mortem examination noted “it is clear (the cat) experienced extreme physical suffering in an inescapable situation, and that heat stroke is the likely cause of death in this case.”
Whatford complained to Clark County Animal Control for months that the cats were disappearing and that she heard cries coming from her neighbor’s yard.
“Animal Control told me I needed proof, yet the officer couldn’t access my neighbor’s property to get the proof. Animal Control referred me to Metro, but the detective wouldn’t do anything until I had proof,” Whatford said during an interview in September.
Greisen testified in support of the measure, but warned that without proper training and resources for police and animal control officers, stricter penalties will do little to help stem abuse and neglect.
Las Vegas justice activist Leslie Turner testified in opposition and said the measure is “just another way to funnel more people into the criminal legal system,” and does nothing to address the causes of cruelty, including “mental health struggles, childhood trauma, cycles of violence, economic instability.”
A 1- to 10-year sentence, she noted, exceeds the 1- to 6-year sentence for child abuse. “How can we justify punishing someone more harshly for harming an animal than for harming a child? What does this say about our priorities?” she asked in written testimony, adding lawmakers should instead invest in “education, early intervention, and community-based mental health resources.”",2025-04-17T01:00:00.000+03:00,https://elkodaily.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/article_bb31650c-efdd-4c53-b943-cd96f301e047.html,Dana Gentry Nevada Current,positive

Albany Co DA's office touts restructurings and discovery of $982K in unused grants - NewsBreak,"The Albany County District Attorney’s office announced several reforms and nearly $1 Million in grant money left unspent by the previous DA’s administration. Among the accomplishments listed Kindlon’s office says they’ve sent 58 people who’ve possessed a gun illegally to jail since January. “Gun crime is a surge on our streets, it is perpetrating violence so everything I can do to get people who have been convicted of illegal gun possession, get those gun guns off the streets get those individual off the streets“ said Kindlon. They’re also getting their finances in order. Kindlon says an audit of the DA’s office led to the discovery of five unused state grants totaling over $982,000. The money will go to the office’s anti violence and victim support programs. “It was basically just sitting on the shelf. We were able to take control of it grants that have been languishing and an unaccounted for, and other grants totaling more than $300,000” said Kindlon. How did the grant money end up — in his words — “sitting on the table”? “I’m not entirely sure why the previous administration chose not to fill out all the paperwork to get more than $600,000 in grant money” Kindlon explained. “This is money that had been allocated planned and spent so if the paperwork hadn’t been done it was money that ultimately the taxpayer was going to be on the hook for” he continued.

2 new health department Test and Go kiosks up and running,"Delaware County officials on Wednesday announced the installation and opening of new Test and Go public health kiosks this week at 69th Street Terminal in Upper Darby and the Delaware County Community College Media Line Road campus in Marple Township.
“Delaware County Council is building a better future for Delaware County, not just focusing on the challenges of today, but the promise of tomorrow,” said Council Vice Chair Richard Womack inside the 69th Street transportation hub Wednesday morning. “We’re working to build a better future for our families, our neighbors and next generations, and we’re doing it by investing in programs and expanding access, eliminating barriers and (meeting) people not where we wish they were, but where they are.”
DCHD spokesperson Matthew Rankin, left, demonstrates the 69th Street kiosk to, from left, Delaware County District Attorney Jack Stollsteimer, County Council Vice Chair Richard Womack and state Sen. Tim Kearney, D-26, Swarthmore. (ALEX ROSE DAILY TIMES) Delaware County Health Department Director Lora Siegmann Werner said the new kiosks bring the total number in the county up to five. The other three are located at the Yeadon Wellness Center, the Keystone First Wellness Center in Chester and the County Government Center in Media.
“We really want to thank all of our partners for their support and enthusiasm that’s helping bring these public health visions to life,” said Werner. “We’re really grateful to Delaware County Community College and SEPTA, for opening a facility and being willing to assist us in reaching residents.”
The kiosks dispense numerous health-related items for free, such as condoms, Narcan nasal spray, emergency blankets, tampons and pads, COVID-19 rapid antigen tests and even laboratory PCR testing for respiratory illnesses and sexually transmitted infections.
The kiosks, first launched in September, are offered through a contract with LTS, formally known as Longview International Technology Solutions, with current costs of about $15,000 per month. Those costs are covered by opioid lawsuit settlement funding, as well as various grants.
Werner said the machines’ stocks are electronically monitored and restocked as needed.
Health department spokesman Matthew Rankin said most of the items can be issued to residents anonymously, but laboratory tests obviously require the user to provide contact information. Those tests are usually collected within 12 hours and results are typically delivered within 24 to 48 hours of drop-off, he said.
“All the items inside are free for all residents to use and since September 2024, we have dispensed nearly 2,000 public health products to our residents, and we just know that will grow after being installed in these high traffic locations,” said Werner. “… I encourage everybody here: Take control of your own health, anytime, on your own terms.”
District Attorney Jack Stollsteimer said the kiosks now also offer free gun locks, a service his office had previously provided through the sheriff’s office and other avenues with limited success.
He said gun safety is a non-partisan issue that everyone agrees needs to be taken seriously and he was happy to report that one lock had already been distributed from the 69th Street kiosk earlier that day.
Delaware County Health Department Director Lora Siegmann Werner discusses the installation of new Test and Go kiosks in Upper Darby and Marple this week. (COURTESY OF DELAWARE COUNTY) Rankin said a total of 16 locks had been dispensed from all machines by Wednesday morning.
Delaware County Community College Director of Safety and Security Matthew Brenner was also on hand for Wednesday’s announcement.
He said the most popular items on campus so far appeared to be first-aid kits, but he was able to provide one of those locks to a young mother after she spoke to him about having a firearm in the house.
The DA’s office had also previously been responsible for distributing Narcan in the county, Stollsteimer said, which the kiosks are also helping get to communities where it is needed, along with drug test strips.
Stollsteimer noted President Donald Trump’s administration recently began promoting a holistic approach to the drug problem in America that encouraged exactly what Delaware County is already doing with Narcan and test strips.
“We are all in the same business of saving people’s lives, so I just want to say to anybody who might be talking to the president in the days to come, Delaware County is already ahead of you. We just need continued funding to keep this program going and to expand it,” he said.
State Sen. Tim Kearney, D-26, Swarthmore, said he has learned during his tenure in elected office that some of the best solutions come from simply listening to what people need and then providing it.
“I’m proud to have played a role in helping secure the location of this Test and Go kiosk because I believe that local and state leaders can come together with a purpose, and when that happens, great things happen and greater benefits are available to our constituents,” he said. “Access to health care should never be a luxury, it should be something to count on, right in your neighborhood. These kiosks are about making things easier, safer, more accessible to people who may not always have the time or the means to get to a hospital or to an urgent care.”",2025-04-17T01:33:00.000+03:00,https://www.delcotimes.com/2025/04/16/2-new-health-department-test-and-go-kiosks-up-and-running,gqlshare,positive

"Abortion in Florida Drop by 12,000 as Heartbeat Law Saves Babies - LifeNews.com","Abortions in Florida declined significantly in 2024 after the state passed a 6-week ban on the procedure in 2023.
Roughly 73,710 abortions killed babies in the state in 2024 compared to 85,770 in 2023, a drop of about 12,100, according to a report from The Guttmacher Institute. Florida’s ban prohibits abortions after the sixth week of pregnancy, making exceptions for victims of rape, incest or human trafficking, in which case an abortion is permitted until 15-weeks gestation.
Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis signed the heartbeat bill into law in April 2023, which a November ballot initiative that was struck down by voters threatened to overturn. A lawsuit filed against the state in 2022 by Planned Parenthood challenging the previous 15-week abortion ban also had the potential to prevent the 2023 law from taking effect, had it managed to declare a right to abortion in the state, but Florida’s Supreme Court ruled against the challenge.

DeSantis was a staunch opponent of the 2024 ballot initiative that threatened to overturn the state’s previous abortion restrictions, stating at the time that the amendment would “allow abortion in Florida up until birth and will invalidate all pro-life protections in state law.”
Abortions in South Carolina also declined by 3,500 after the state passed a similar 6-week ban in 2023, while even states with few abortion limits, such as Colorado and New Mexico, saw declines of about 2,400 between 2023 and 2024, according to the report.
In Wisconsin, abortions rose by 388% between 2023 and 2024, rising from 1,300 to 6,100, the report found. Arizona, California, Kansas, Ohio and Virginia all saw increases of over 3,000 within the same time frame.
The number of people traveling out of state for abortions also declined from 169,700 in 2023 to 155,100 in 2024, with Illinois, North Carolina, Kansas and New Mexico seeing the most out-of-state patients, Guttmacher found. However, a larger share of individuals have turned to online clinics for abortion pill prescriptions, with about 40,000 more abortions occurring through this method nationwide in 2024 compared to the previous year.
Several states have passed greater restrictions on abortions following the U.S. Supreme Court’s overturn of Roe v. Wade in June of 2022, which sent the debate over legal limits back to the states.

World News: Putin reveals space ties with Beijing,"Russia and China have ambitious plans for space co-operation, Russian President Vladimir Putin said yesterday.
According to Putin, many countries are interested in collaborating with Russia, and Moscow remains committed to its plans for deep space exploration, including missions to the Moon and Mars.
Putin separately praised Elon Musk, comparing him to Sergei Korolev, the chief engineer behind the Soviet Union’s space success in the 1950s and 1960s.
Tass news agency quoted him as drawing a comparison between Musk and Sergei Korolev, a Soviet engineer who was instrumental in the success in sending Yuri Gagarin on the world’s first crewed spaceflight in 1961.",2025-04-17T02:01:20.410+03:00,https://www.gdnonline.com/Details/1350672/Putin-reveals-space-ties-with-Beijing,,positive
World News: Court backs 'biological' definition of women,"Britain’s highest court ruled yesterday that only biological and not trans women meet the definition of a woman under equality laws, a landmark decision greeted with concern by trans supporters but welcomed by the government as bringing clarity.
The much anticipated ruling centred on whether a trans woman with a gender recognition certificate (GRC), a formal document giving legal recognition of someone’s new gender, is protected from discrimination as a woman under Britain’s Equality Act.
The decision confirms that single-sex services for women such as refuges, hospital wards and sports can exclude trans women, clearing up legal ambiguity.
Transgender campaigners said the decision could lead to discrimination, especially over employment issues.
“The unanimous decision of this court is that the terms ‘women’ and ‘sex’ in the Equality Act 2010 refer to a biological woman and biological sex,” deputy president of the Supreme Court Patrick Hodge said.
“But we counsel against reading this judgment as a triumph for one or more groups in our society at the expense of another – it is not.”
In the US, legal challenges are underway after President Donald Trump issued executive orders that include barring transgender people from military service.
Yesterday’s judgement in Britain followed legal action by a campaign group, For Women Scotland (FWS), against guidance issued by the devolved Scottish government that accompanied a 2018 law designed to increase the proportion of women on public sector boards.
The guidance said a trans woman with a gender recognition certificate was legally a woman. FWS lost its case in the Scottish courts, but the Supreme Court ruled in its favour.
“Today the judges have said what we always believed to be the case: that women are protected by their biological sex, that sex is real and that women can now feel safe that services and spaces designated for women are for women,” Susan Smith, co-director of FWS, told cheering supporters outside the court.",2025-04-17T02:01:20.483+03:00,https://www.gdnonline.com/Details/1350658/Court-backs-%E2%80%98biological%E2%80%99-definition-of-women,,positive
川普執政美俄交好 蒲亭稱讚馬斯克如蘇聯太空英雄 - VNExplorer,川普執政美俄交好 蒲亭稱讚馬斯克如蘇聯太空英雄（法新社莫斯科16日電） 俄羅斯總統蒲亭（Vladimir Putin）今天對大學生發表談話時，讚揚億萬富豪馬斯克，稱他是可與蘇聯時期傳奇火箭工程師卡洛勒夫（Sergei Korolev）相媲美的先驅。法新社報導，在美國總統川普（Donald Trump）執政下，美國與俄羅斯建立了更緊密的關係，而美國太空探索科技公司（SpaceX）暨特斯拉（Tesla）執行長馬斯克( Elon Musk）正是川普政府中的重要人物。蒲亭今天造訪鮑曼莫斯科國立科技大學（Bauman Moscow State Technical University）時告訴學生：「你知道的，有一位名叫馬斯克的人，他住在美國，你可以說他對火星非常著迷。」他提及：「這種人通常不會出現在人類群體中，他們滿腦子都是某些想法。這些想法即使在今日都會看似難以置信，往往會在一段時間後實現。就像我們先驅者卡洛勒夫的想法一樣，最終在適當時機得以實現。」 卡洛勒夫被視為蘇聯太空計畫之父，他設計首顆「史普尼克」（Sputnik）衛星及載人太空船「東方一號」（ Vostok 1），這艘太空船於1961年升空，使得蘇聯太空人加加林（Yuri Gagarin）成為進入太空的史上第一人。馬斯克則時常批評烏克蘭，上月曾指控烏克蘭總統澤倫斯基（Volodymyr Zelensky）想要一場「永遠的戰爭」。,2025-04-17T01:37:00.000+03:00,https://hk.vnexplorer.net/r/2610.html,VNExplorer,positive

"Family First welcomes UK ""what is a woman"" ruling, urges Dutts and Albo to follow - News Hub","Family First welcomes the unanimous decision of the British Supreme court to recognise the true definition of woman in law and urges Peter Dutton and Anthony Albanese to immediately do the same.
Queensland lead Senate candidate Katie Lush said both the Coalition and Labor go into the May 3 election pledged to retain Australia’s farcical definition of woman in the Sex Discrimination Act.
“It should not have taken UK women’s groups seven years of litigation to get a court to state the obvious,” Ms Lush said.
“Peter Dutton and Anthony Albanese should not continue to put Australian women through the indignity of having to share their private spaces with biological males and have them make their sport unfair.
“Girls’ and women’s rights advocates Kirralie Smith and Sal Grover are fighting expensive legal battles against biological males who want to invade women’s spaces because Labor and the Coalition refuse to fix the Sex Discrimination Act.”
Family First is fielding 100 candidates at this election, the sixth largest of any party.

En Baja California se cuentan con diez Familias de Corazón certificadas.
Tijuana, BC.- La gobernadora Marina del Pilar Avila Olmeda hizo un llamado a la ciudadanía para sumarse al programa “Familias de Corazón” del DIF Baja California, con el objetivo de contar con más hogares temporales cálidos, seguros y amorosos para las niñas, niños y adolescentes (NNA) bajo resguardo del Estado.

Una Familia de Corazón es una familia que dice: aquí estoy, puedes contar conmigo mientras se resuelve tu situación jurídica. Es una familia que abre su casa. Que ofrece tiempo, afecto, compromiso para acompañar temporalmente a una niña, niño o adolescente”, explicó.
La gobernadora destacó que con el apoyo de las familias, se ha brindado cuidado, amor y protección a 15 niñas, niños y adolescentes, quienes han encontrado un lugar donde sanar, aprender y soñar.
Son 15 vidas transformadas, 15 historias que están siendo re-escritas con ternura, con dignidad, y con mucha esperanza. Cada abrazo, cada plato en la mesa, cada noche un cuento antes de dormir, sin duda representa una oportunidad de sanar y de volver a creer”, enfatizó.
