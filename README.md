Impact Analysis of the Recent US-China Tariffs on Global Trade and Economy

##  Project Tasks:

1.  **Data Collection and Cleaning**
    - Research and collect relevant data on US-China trade relations, including historical tariff rates, trade volume, and product categories affected by the recent tariffs.
    - Obtain economic data related to global trade and countries that   
    have een indirectly affected by these tariffs.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
    - Perform exploratory analysis to identify trends in the trade volume before and after the tariffs were implemented.
    - Visualize the changes in the trade balance between the US and China, as well as with other countries.
    - Explore the effects on specific industries or product categories (e.g., technology, agriculture).

3. **Sentiment Analysis of News Articles**
    - Collect and analyze news articles, trade reports, and government publications to understand public sentiment regarding the tariffs.
    - Apply sentiment analysis techniques to gauge the positive, negative, or neutral sentiments toward the tariffs from different sources.

4. **Correlation Analysis**
    - Investigate any potential correlations between tariff changes and key economic indicators, such as GDP growth, inflation rates, stock market reactions, and employment rates in both the US and China.

5. **Predictive Modeling**
    - Build a basic predictive model to estimate the future impact of the tariffs on trade flow between the US, China, and other key countries.
    - Use machine learning techniques like regression models, decision trees, or time series analysis.

6. **Visualization of Findings**
    - Create interactive visualizations that showcase the changes in trade patterns, the industries most affected, and economic shifts before and after the tariffs.
    - Present findings in a clear and compelling manner using tools like Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Plotly.

7. **Conclusion and Recommendations**
    - Summarize the overall impact of the tariffs on global trade and the US-China economic relationship.
    - Provide actionable recommendations for businesses, policymakers, or future trade agreements.
